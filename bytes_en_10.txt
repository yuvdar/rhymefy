The name will bear your face
The name will bear your face
And he will appoint you and give you peace
God bless you Rachel and Leah
God bless you Rachel and Leah
May God bless you and bless you
-----------
There is no love that burns in the chest
I got calls from the bank manager
He said to me, Habibi, the money here was thrown
Someone loves what's in your pocket
Milking wastes everything without feeling
Milking wastes everything without feeling
-----------
And at night like a madman shouting in the streets
You will not see the smile on my face anymore
I mean, I still love you
I know I was wrong to forgive a child
This betrayal made me sad and silent
I loved only you...
-----------
It was love at first sight
As in the stories
Love at first sight
What ruined me
There was laughter in your eyes
When you said it was very pleasant
-----------
My love promises that forever we will love
We were meant for each other and in heaven it was written
Would you agree, would you agree?
To be the mother of my children
I reach out to you in a ring you can not believe yet
And wait for you to answer me, marry me?
-----------
Child I remember
With your two little hands that came to hug me
When you woke up from bad dreams
Mother's embrace and we would fall asleep
I always kept and hugged me
God sent you to me as a gift
-----------
God will bear His face to you
God will bear His face to you
And he will appoint you, and will make peace for you
Shema Israel
The name of God
The name is one
-----------
We do not go to kindergarten today
I'm coming up again on B
The strongest army feels the distance
And an unending longing
On Thursday they get on A. They are all arranged
And stand for an hour in the sun and the commander drops a bit
-----------
I'll hug I'll dream
Anything you ask
And there is no love in this world
You turned feelings into sounds
The silence suddenly becomes poetry
The words come with you
-----------
And who is the woman I'm happy with
You told me how difficult it is for you to get used to it
You said you were fighting to overcome him
You're a bit confused and you want me again
And that you hide with a smile will hurt
So why did you let me go
-----------
When two destinies are connected
Forever clinging hands
And the ever-beautiful, diving into your eyes
My valiant woman, won the water like
The whole world is at our feet
The sanctity of this moment will not be forgotten
-----------
Like Koh Samui without the monkey
The heat rises either
What is happening here
So let's feel the rhythm and either or
category
People and blogs
-----------
Another memory of you fills me with longing
For all those days bathed in love
It just seemed like we were saying goodbye
But at night you still visit
And it's your time now to know how much
You loved me and loved every day more
-----------
Stroking her hair
His hand was in her hand
I could not understand
Do not want to believe
Because I love her
I do not get out of my heart
-----------
Neither I was wrong nor right
Already being I am my body collapsing
Then you want to sit and talk
About how much you missed me again
How did you not see? It's only me who devoted himself to you
Sorry but go on without me
-----------
Come in peace with the crown of her husband,
In Brina and in Zahala too,
With the confidence of a virtuous people,
Come, come, come
With the confidence of a virtuous people
Come, come bride
-----------
And I see with you a lifetime
I will never forget this moment
Your steps in the white dress
The teary eyes
The embarrassed smile
How we got excited like the first time
-----------
It's raining now
Save your life, on a cold night
Please tell me when
want to be with you
At the station, where waiting ...
Salamat, Salamat ...
-----------
Close to the soul
Because I feel like hugging you
Another night curfew has been with you for now
I always stay and will always live in two
I want to feel as special as I felt
When you touched me
-----------
She does everything she wants
I'm in love
Makes me fly with her
I was caressing
Then she leaves without a word
Say a word
-----------
When she saw him and had a wall
In the second half you will be forever
Sign their love pact on such a night
And she is like a farm approaching
Excited to be of help to him
Will be ....
-----------
Where love remained
Which we dreamed of realizing
I always thought you were one to me
But I find myself practicing again
The tears had dried up and the smile had gone
And for me now sad and bitter memory
-----------
Does not give a moment of rest and quiet
That's why I want to get up and leave
Be with me at home and say back
Feels like the prison does not release
Be with me at home and say back
Feels like the prison does not release
-----------
What I did not do for you I gave everything that was
I always believed that with you I would find peace
I never gave up and you stayed with you ruined everything
I can not anymore
You do not know that everything about me is frozen
And say, let's start from scratch
-----------
Do not let your foot fall; Al-Janum Shomarek.
Behold, the keeper of Israel shall not sleep, nor sleep.
The Lord is the Lord, your shadow is by your right hand.
Their day the sun will not burn, and the moon at night.
God will protect you from all evil.
God will keep you and your coming from now to eternity
-----------
I always think about you every minute
Believe in love
If it's you then come and tell me
With me you always want to live
Happy to be my whole life
Then I'll feel it
-----------
I knew many girls
But there is nothing more beautiful than you
Only I always dreamed of you
So give me some of your heart
Do not know what to say to you it's hard my heart broke
Only you love tonight Come, it's not too late
-----------
The light in my life and the heat at my nights
Breathing you every minute you touched deeply in the soul
Ask for everything for you
If you only show me your love
Without you I have no peace without you I have no day
Only with you I'm sure I'll live the dream
-----------
Come to me in moments of despair
And give me some love
I wrote another song you mention
And again imagine your face
I want to shout to the world
To tell everyone that it's bad without you
-----------
I only gave you love
I gave my life for you
And I will give it all until the day of my death
I still live in the shadow of thought
Looking for the feeling I had
Pray you come back .....
-----------
I do not have the strength anymore
You're too big for me
You stole my heart, oh how painful it is
You got me around me I love you
I gave you everything and it did not fit you
Instead of being with me you went with others
-----------
How come you're getting away from me
And for everything you give up
Looking for answers to the same questions
Which remained open when you decided to leave
I'm tired of thoughts and can no longer wait
That you will return to my life and be close to me
-----------
You'll come back
I hurt at night
And the days were too dark for me
Sad and do not know
If you love me again
I liked
-----------
To tell you that you love
Every moment of my life
After you like a blind man I always went
And I will go with you both good and evil
I love you in the streets I shouted
If you'll excuse me I'll take you away from here
-----------
Pulling me into your life like a madman wants you
Dreaming to be just by your side
You're the one that makes me bloom
Every day with you I feel more shining
Let me all open your heart to me
If you say yes, I will fight for you
-----------
I will not forget the days
The embracing nights
Which we shared at the time together
I was hit by a blow
Still trying to get out of it
But nothing helps that again comes back
-----------
Escort - what she does with one smile of hers
And now he does not know how to get out of it
Lee says only yours
And I will not leave you
Suddenly she tells me time is over
Somebody tell me what to do
-----------
From the depths.
From the depths I called to you, come to me
Facing a moon illuminates your way back to me
Spread and dissolve against the touch of your hands
Whispering in your ears.
Who's calling you tonight ...
-----------
Just wait, do not give up on us
Just wait, do not give up on the two of us
Writes a letter of love to you and my soul
Two years of silence have passed and you are no longer with me
You forget can not
Standing here shouting loudly
-----------
And it has not passed this resin so inside
You always said only to let it go back if I believed
I'm wounded now and it does not pass
No, this is not the time to heal my heart
It's also not the dream you might come to visit
I can not do it anymore
-----------
How did it end? Have we tried everything?
This is not what we wanted, you are not here anymore ...
All the sweet words I whispered to you
Wake me up from the dream
All doors are rotating in your world
Between the rooms I have no room
-----------
End, the weekend is already here
To parents you have not left
A box of ready-made food
More, another strange man you passed
Scars are a defensive wall
Your heart breaks and breaks
-----------
I guess the shopping as you would then arrive
On the verge of sunset

I almost broke down and the truth was that I could not sleep,
I wanted to hear your voice today
And I lost my mind of love and they did not tell me how dangerous it was.
-----------
It's you who in my blue dress takes my heart
I always wanted to know how to stop time? How do you feel pain?
And only your long breaths make some noise
Even if you start talking now, you can not lie
And only your long breaths make some noise
Even if you start talking now, you can not lie
-----------
And will not leave you alone
So who will catch you not crying
Do not cry
Ann
Do not trust anyone
with your...
-----------
And you have no one to leave
And life passed by
So I get up and leave
Into another night
Looking high over clouds
And moon number
-----------
And now,
There will be almost,
There is a whole life to go,
End not written ...
And everything will be good for us ...
And everything will be good for us.
-----------
Look at me now, whispering your name alone
Drowning in your image
In later hours there were others
I unintentionally painted your face
I heard your voice and I pictured your eyes
And look, after all I'm finally coming back to you
-----------
And the days are also slow, minutes stretched,
You can not accelerate, stop the tears
Give her another breath, just move toward you,
Let her love, hold hands
In the letters he wrote, he really loved her,
A step before everyone, before everyone is a step
-----------
I'm afraid of reality, I prefer the imagination,
So one for how long I choose my dream,
And giving in, here I am again sorry, here I am again sorry
And how she always wants and I do not want to,
What am I so scared of, I do not know what I want,
Go or stay, if there is any other place at all
-----------
A few weeks away,
When I'm alone I do not hurt,
A few weeks away,
You say I'm running away,
A few weeks away,
I'm leaving again, because I know, there will be no other time
-----------
I'm still here to remember, more or less
In everything that gives me strength
And who said again that loneliness was light, the door locked
And you have no intention of opening
And the one that only takes everything
Maybe I'm just busy talking
-----------
No, I'm not afraid
Lose myself again
what has happened,
How do I come and go?
To a place I used to be
Have a good day.
-----------
Come, come with me
Until your winter passes
Come, come with me
Your heart is sensitive to cold
Come, come with me, I can not
Come, come with me, I can not
-----------
There was a little emotion about everything that hurt
The heart will go as far as it can
I have nothing else, nothing else
I have nothing else but you to understand
I have nothing else, nothing else
I have nothing else but you to understand
-----------
Not just color sex or religion
I am a person who will listen to the soul in me a little
And Ash shouts again from the no-man's-land
You shoot me but I feel like a friend
After all, at the end of all the nights everyone dreams of a great dream
Love Free wants to sing aloud
-----------
Do not hug me because nothing has changed
You will not see, the simple beauty,
An old scratched record, family meals
You will no longer see a kite bird tied to a string
But I promise to see you
I promise to see you
-----------
Here comes the time
What the wind would bring with her
What will melt the silence
And there are reasons for everything
There's a never-ending dream
At the end of the road you'll be happy
-----------
All I'm saying now ...
Sometimes the song says in the melody
And better expressed this way
For every sound is a gift
Accepts vitality and has value.
All I'm saying now ...
-----------
Bring your face to me at all times
And sanctify my thoughts with supreme holiness
God of souls creates my soul
Hear my voice calling to you
God of souls creates my soul
Hear my voice calling to you
-----------
Do not let your feet go down; Al-Yannum, your name.
D. There is no sleep, and no sleep - the keeper, Israel.
The Lord is your Shepherd; YHWH your shadow, by the hand of your right hand.
And the day, the sun is not - yell; And he breathed in the night.
God, keep you from all evil: keep your soul.
God, keep your departure and come - from time to time.
-----------
Do not worry it's close, close.
We'll meet again and we'll be fine
It will be soon, close
The two of us together will be good for us
Do not worry it's close, close
The night was quiet now.
-----------
Or solar sun
A long time has passed
The sun is smart and it shone a million times
And sank into the sea
The sun is smart and it shone a million times
And sank into the sea
-----------
Clouds of hope come from above
Between man and man between man and place
And you return to me between day and night
Scattering words you saw in a dream
Clouds of hope come from above
Between man and man between man and place
-----------
And the secrets on the water
There are angels hovering there
And all the puzzles of my life in the meantime are asking for rain
And there is no case when I do not
In the world of God
And with the puzzles of my life still dancing in front of the stars
-----------
Then he screams with a broken heart
And you gather dreams from innocent eyes
From my eyes that rise to the sky
You gather dreams from your innocent eyes
From my eyes that rise to the sky
Cloudy
-----------
What power of words in front of your power
The paths I'll go for you, for you
If I had words to describe
So I'd certainly say
That I have made my way to myself
And then everything would work out
-----------
I'm going to the Freedom Mountains
I go back to winning the blue
I travel with everything I have
To a place where you do not have to ask
Just wait for me I'm already on your way to you
My freedom, everything
-----------
At a time of pleasure for the time of love
Audio
How my heart knelt and broke
What my power is inside me is hidden
When each word continues to a familiar melody
When each word continues to a familiar melody
-----------
In my weakness I am a hero
Do not forget me quietly
Watering the secret of Mazor rain
Until the fear passes, and with your mercy I will be a hero
I'll be a hero
Hero ...
-----------
Come on, come and come
Play Me My Beloved Player
True truth burners
So beautiful in your tears is revealed
Come on, come and come
Come on, come and come
-----------
The song touches longing ...
Dreaming that she would come to me
Perhaps you will understand my secrets
Then he hides in my feelings
And my prayer is my longing
The song touches longing ...
-----------
Do not worry, I'll find you again
Come and see what happened to me because of you
Wrapped in the cliches of love
Here you are smiling with an attractive smile
It is deceptive
I was created ...
-----------
You know my special
And that's the secret that connects
And without you without your words
I'm alone
Of all the doubts ...
because you are...
-----------
And tried to put up with the clock
If life is an unspoken puzzle
And secrets flow like streams
Hope to find all the colors of the rainbow
Leave a good impression here and collect words
Maybe after all you'll reach the sky ...
-----------
Before you bloom
There are courtiers and their eyes will always be narrow
And always refuse to apples that offer you witches
You'll come barefoot around the palaces
And it will remind you of yourself and who you wanted to be
It will remind you there is more than one type of princesses
-----------
Not to stop and if possible not to gasp,
And then at the end find the mother to make sure close enough,
You wash your tears at the end of the day.
Simply, I just want, in a crowd of people who just want to impress,
I stop for a second, I do not want to have a choice, you'll gain some breathing time.
Simple, I just want.
-----------
I open the window again and the sun is above me, among all the whispering clouds,
To hear me close between everything that passes, to know what is brown without burning
Everything I have lost now I find, and in every little corner where I am,
The fear that lives here becomes distant, and every red light turns green
And this is a blow under the belt, for everything that goes off, and in every little corner where I am,
The fear that lives here becomes distant, and every red traffic light changes to green
-----------
So yes, yes jump into the water, learn myself a little drop,
And if inside there is a kind of handshake, only the sound of a beat.
I do not want to fall, it's just that I do not know who makes me look,
She had not seen it all threatening to jump from the boat to the water now.
I do not want to go, it's just the little girl who shrugs shoulders,
She just barks and does not bite now, she's just used to applauding her.
-----------
Of all the fears to forget, of all the tears to forgive, what to do, to go all the way.
War on hearts, songs and swords,
War on hearts, songs and swords,
War on hearts, songs and swords, not like this and that's how I was born to be.
All the tears to forgive, what to do, go all the way, go all the way,
Walk, walk, walk to the end.
-----------
And if she did not guard herself, something else would be released from her too, something else.
The white sheep is not a party sheep, her diary is full and she has plans,
She's on the right track, she's not just hanging out, she's not a sheep of stings, she's a committed sheep.
The white sheep knows that you have to be careful, and if it does not hold tight the order will disperse,
And if she did not guard herself, something else would be released from her too, something else.
The white sheep never catch a side, it is okay with everyone but not with anyone, it is a sheep from the UN, everyone understands, but does not get dirty, it is a white sheep, but not dirty, it is a white sheep.
-----------
I have short answers and I have no sentiments, I do not understand you still embrace me.
Maybe you'll find one who does not cry at night to give you a place like you gave me,
I want so much to go back home and put all my complications here.
Give me a minute, I'm just discovering me,
Do not go away, it's me who chooses me.
You do not understand you're still waiting for me, maybe you'll have one to stroke your tears, you say it's me and I just keep on crying, still crying.
-----------
Who looked at me and did not look me in the eye
Keep a point of light
In a world that gave me no strength,
I want to scream,
What I had always known
Who said then to say
-----------
And I do not like being that one, which is closed like a cage
Hey look at me, I almost fall
Hey, it's passing over me, I'm running to the mountains
How are you every time around midnight?
All the wires almost break off
look at me
-----------
Then obliterates their existence
On Friday you'll find me so ridiculous
It occurs to me in a strange way
That you might have left your home on Friday night
So far to give me a kiss
On Friday when I get on the roads ...
-----------
/ And this is your joyful collision and of sadness and fear / And from within you grows a spine
/ Then it hurts you
And a crack opened into a deep abyss / of a gold cage you built sweet / so you checked and it's just a bottom
Low-pitched screamer / you've already thought to yourself cheeky / skipped on your way along the canopy path
/ To the edge of the world to the part / where you forgive
And from inside you grow a spine / then it hurts you
-----------
Someone got into someone's life
And you stand on the doorstep and leave
The outside world was gathered to the beginning
Everything spreads like sand on the beach
And that's the end of the day the sun rises
Just when the end is coming to us
-----------
And my handwriting on a note I left there
I love you that way
And for a few months you've been hard on me like a stone
The beginning of the end rips my stomach
And a month from now we'll be like new ones
I'm here. You're just two people
-----------
And then when I turn my face to the wind / drops of love will be dripping on my neck / and the washing of the confusion will dry up
And sweet / sweet words will find my mouth
And then when I turn my face to the wind / I will hear thunderstorms and lightning / or maybe the sweet will turn
A salty life will fill my heart
When a strong blow surprises you / I will be ready on every side and turn / because I will know inside / that there is something
He will drive me to the same old goal for the same old purpose
-----------
And in all the crates in the pockets of worn dresses
And touch, she'll know
How to drown in the hidden puddles
And open the wounds from which she had already learned to let go
Find all that was lost there on the way
It will burn a little and forget
-----------
Send him, let him go free, even though she knows he will not come back to you,
Send him, let him go to his place, to the shrouded in the wind,
Let him take off his youth, run to romp with the wind,
Let him whistle and chant, skip the stones of his path, let him live as he did
Do not be sad anymore, because he went like a bird of prey,
Get to the sand because you know your lover will not come back to you
