Through the fears in the barefoot / She falls the wind and cuts
She has a flame in her trembling hands / continues walking and without seeing
And she promises / she did not run away / she just went / slightly lost in the dark
If he hugs / she will shut up / look at him and say nothing / it does not matter
What was or would be? Always have somewhere to go back to / Everything will pass in a moment
Just follow the light
-----------
Do not worry, the darkness will shine on you / The sky will not fall suddenly
Do not worry, the moon will smile at you / all fear will change at once in daylight
All the prayers in the world / were already said when the evening came / and only you forgot to ask
The secret of the magic you lost a long time ago
You sit quietly in front of me / guard close to the cards / lips whispering an old rhythm
Like a forgotten dance wrapped in instincts
-----------
If only time could catch me not falling
So wait, give me a minute
Either way you'll be the only one that will stay
either way
I'll give you a hand if you stand up to me
All of me
-----------
And constantly galloping forward / not stopping to see the existing
People sing a new song on the radio / they are also momentary guests in the world
But with you all slowly / every time to love you a little more
If you feel like coming / So let 's stand still / Good sunlight / Dance in the street
If you feel like coming / so come / and look quietly / smile and good / I will be good
Maybe it's a little romantic on my part / but I am / and nothing will happen to you / If you only love me
-----------
Give me a tomorrow where I can change everything,
Let me rewrite the end of the story
Because if you only give, then I can imagine,
Then I can smash the walls of my loneliness,
Because if you only give, then I can risk,
To burn and burn the walls of my silence
-----------
When no one saw
Delete the tears on your face
And outside on our big roof was a pale moon
Because there are things that we will not be able to change either
And about love, after all, I want us to talk
When I have you, nothing matters
-----------
Again he calls me again, again at night he comes to me in my dream
Libby again a little sad winter is not easy maybe you can warm me up only me
Again you will understand again at night I do not fall asleep and turn the pillow
Again he calls me again Winter is not easy for me and you can warm me up just me
I was thinking about how I would proceed from here
Take me now to you
-----------
You deserve everything
Ah, ah
Why? Who? Who can help you?
Why Who Who Can Who Should
Why? Who? Who can help you?
Why Who Who Can Who Should
-----------
Stretch and become infinity
And your words like water continue to wash
And the fear is in my eyes
For eternity is only present
You tell me how we're always two
But so alone.
-----------
They came back to me and I suddenly felt myself again
Today alone, too, is not frightening
I matured looking into the future
Here without you and not alone anymore
Today I am no longer the same girl
No longer that girl ..
-----------
Hope, expect to see you by my side
Time does not pass,
The days are getting longer
How do I ignore,
It's not me at all
And like a blind man, you see nothing.
-----------
Believe in you, you are our strength
With full faith, only Father will follow you
You always hear the prayers
And hope that one day everything will work out here
For you always keep this people,
You guard us
-----------
And only wake up
After the big tears
And there is life after you too
Strong to fight
They will not say that I fell to your feet
How can I beg you?
-----------
You did not even think that I would raise the heads of El Al
You did not imagine that she would remain so sad
Today I opened a new page, an unused white sheet
Today I did something I already knew was that
Everything is clear to me and closed that there is already a good end to the story
I'm with you not continuing I'm already in the next story
-----------
I have no head for the stories I deserve more
Give me great love in my heart and happiness
A real man has to come like a man
Love me and give me a crown
If you want me, come and make me
Make me a queen!
-----------
You're driving my mind crazy, my heart,
My head, my heart
I do not know what to do with you ..
A mess, a mess, a mess, I feel like a mess!
Mess, mess, mess, you're doing me what you're doing to me ..
A mess.
-----------
You are the soul mate
You are my one, who lights my life for me
My whole world, heals my pain
Soul, soul, my soul
My love, my love, my love
Your ...... I
-----------
I will not give you up
Until you move, I feel like yelling
Until you move, I will not shut up
Until you move, I'll wait
And the rhythm will not let go
I want to shout!
-----------
For me the world
Again he charmed me with my eyes and from there everything flowed
Perhaps only he, he knows the way
Just drive me crazy
I've never met a guy like that
Gentleman, rude and romantic
-----------
Bring it
The money as applied to the dispenser
Bring it
We'll go to the cafe for a movie
You'll understand, you'll understand me ..
Them
-----------
But like cats, they always howl
Diplomatically, they will guarantee you a kingdom
Mathematically, the explanation is simple
Another man, another lie, and another pinch in the heart
And again forgive and start falling in love
Men, men, are not so innocent ...
-----------
Those who hate will die
Whoever hates you will die
You are suitable for love
Those who hate will die
Whoever hates you will die
It's all just a lie ...
-----------
For such a wound
And I see them
And I am so deprived
Gone are the days
And I will never
I will not forget you
-----------
From every smile
The heart melts
What had long since died
I swear every word is true
Both good and bad
I love
-----------
Because it is as intense as the death of love
Because many waters will not be able to extinguish love
And rivers will not wash it
Put my seal on your heart
Put my seal on your arm
Because it is as intense as the death of love
-----------
And sacred to you
And asks you ...
That the good God will keep you
And light your way
I'll always be here for you
Together in the temple of your love.
-----------
You're close to me
Just hug you tight in my hand
And how you know everything about me
And my heart touches
And he smiles at me.
Love only you.
-----------
My love
Every second in my heart
You don t know how much
And my beloved
Your day and mine
It's only you and I know why.
-----------
Happy in my parts that I finally discovered,
I won.
Without you, what do I have,
What do I have anyway?
Because to my heart you are a solved puzzle,
Just love me back ...
-----------
The end of illusions
You only believed to infinity my love
Today it's over gone
I have no regrets because today I know what I should have known long ago
No one like me has another like me in this world
No one like me has another like me in this world ...
-----------
I really want you
Tenderness in the touch you touch
To amaze me you know
Every second we are together
Love you without fear
I want you always close to me ...
-----------
Everything has been erased long ago
I sit and you still think about you
You're with me everywhere.
I'll always remember how we once loved each other
We had good ...
I remember how you promised ...
-----------
Hug her
Into your heart do not leave
Love her and tell her all the secrets
If she cries she will wipe her tears
Be smart and do not make any mistakes
If it is yours you will fulfill her dreams
-----------
I loved you. I waited for you
I did everything just for you
You looked at me and smiled at me
I wanted you too close
I wanted you close to me
I don 't know how you go.
-----------
And the heart is not calm,
Inside me there is a storm - in the soul
I have no peace and no rest,
Inside me there is a storm - in the soul
I have no peace and no rest.
You ask God ...
-----------
In my heart, in my heart
How does it always happen to me?
He approaches, he approaches
Even when he went I knew he would come back
Because only with him I see the light
Everyone told me it was just a fairy tale ...
-----------
How beautiful you are, it's a celebration night.
Now listen carefully, keep your heart close
And on the way to see how a day without you is worthless
Have whatever you want, whatever you have prayed for
Happiness, peace, good hour!
Come dancing, because the joy is great ...
-----------
I love you more than anything
Even if the sun suddenly rises in the west
I'll always be yours in any situation
I want you to come to me and tell me
My Soul.
I want you only to love because it makes me good ...
-----------
Like death or life,
Like death or life.
Holy saint You are holy
Hear our prayers and do not sneeze,
The people of Israel pray to you
Keep us like children.
-----------
Between happiness and sorrow ...
And the story of my love
Written from Heart of Dreams,
You write it with me
The whole story.
Between happiness and sorrow ...
-----------
It's a chill
You certainly did not
I dream,
I love you,
Everything you said.
Take me with you ...
-----------
We want you forever.
One night and enough ...
Just how you make me smile
Do not tell me to go,
We want you forever.
One night and enough ...
-----------
You'll be worth it.
How much more you want to run away
How much more will you continue to rub,
Enough, I've had enough of you
If so, I will go.
Thirst for the word, thirst for the word ...
-----------
Only we love.
This is the time you know there is love
Which takes me and leads,
I now understand that only with you
Everything is real not like a fairy tale.
Even if I evaded ...
-----------
Changes to me in a second
And even if you play,
Maybe I did not notice
For me it's drastic too
How long will I hide it?
In thrill, in fear and longing to touch ...
-----------
And the secret of your heart is the secret of my heart
I swore to love you
Now I am complete
If you just give me a place
Stay and dream
Love you like today.
-----------
And together we will return,
True love Who can stop?
We'll go big
Any real obstacle,
It's like dying when you're not with me.
I believed in you ...
-----------
No need to hurry.
At your side I am a queen
And everything is simple,
Like I'm with you
Flying easily.
I have you...
-----------
I'm resetting again,
It does not really help
I'm already in love,
A strong wind blows me to you
The sun shines on my face.
You have ways to drive me crazy ...
-----------
A little rest
Know freedom and feel more complete
All evil must forgive
New page open
And my eyes open.
Fly in the wind ...
-----------
Like a trap again drowning me happily
You will not fall asleep until the morning light comes.
Night and moonlight
He sits on my window,
Just give me some flower
To warm the heart.
-----------
Now you are far from here and that is the end of the world
Sending warm kisses from here to there.
I'd like to be your queen
To fly with you to a distant land,
Hold me close to you
Now let me go.
-----------
Romance is as cheap as ports without entry
Did I steal your heart?
Sorry I apologize, it's yours back
And peace on Israel.
So tell me baby, are you still waiting for me?
I did not know what ...
-----------
Relaxed inside my body
Time ishes me
Kissing my sand
A grain, a grain of my mouth
Now I'm clear
Now allowed
-----------
From our loneliness trophy
There was a juice of blue grapes
Cradled me like a wind blowing
Slowly in the hammock of darkness
The night came with warm fingers
Fort on the harp of oblivion
-----------
Everything comes back to me, days we did not know
Instreams or balls for joy
Between the pages of nostalgia - both of us stayed there
Like two crazy people, they're on a sidewalk
Boyfriend of old, how about you today? ...
Everything comes back to me
-----------
They brought you to me
From a country so different?
Are you happy?
Are you happy?
A day is after another day
And a fifth year passes
-----------
For one word
I'll give you so much
And if he holds out a hand to me
And if he wants to
For very little
I'll give you so much
-----------
We want to dance this crazy dance
The blood in me was agitated
It is not over
You want to ask for just one more dance
Then go ...
Go go ...
-----------
And come hold me
As always
To breathe the outside
And I'll hug the inside
And be confused
But between your arms
-----------
Receives a sign of grace
Save your soul from the abyss ...
Soul and horror, delicate embroidery
The little girl who did not fall asleep
The woman bows her head
A strange bird passed through her dream
-----------
My love, the expectation is that there is a shadow of mourning
I am a blocking block from salty
In the throat is a cloud of tears in the wind
In a sad body, a heart is flooded
Call you, listen to him
And all this I love and I always love
-----------
Come mother, come mother,
And look at him, too.
No, I'm not afraid of the dark,
And I do not tremble at all.
Come mother, come mother,
Sit with me until I grow up.
-----------
Oh, give me strength
Never forget
This time it will hurt terribly
When the door closes on you
Everything is the same
But it's so hard for me without you
-----------
And it will come, you will see ...
And it will come, you know
Not everything will shake us
Not everything will hit
And what will open to us
am waiting
-----------
This is my old man
Darjeeling is a small castle
Between them is a loaf of wine and a dish
Serra Herr Dandane
Chun Dar Chino Shankash Dard
Dela Man Kashana
-----------
His love is divine and sacred
A flower boy is
His hair is made of silk and gold
His cheeks are red as blood
And his character is good and warm
The groom
-----------
You try to fall in love with anything you do not have
And do not tell me
I've collected quite a few things you would love
I built another shelf for a collection in the closet
Sorry I did not wait if you came back
I'm one of those who has talent
-----------
Wake up from the dream she will not come back anymore
Every sad song scratches my heart is addictive
And how I just wait for time to pass
Maybe everything was a dream and still here
I only have to cry to hurt you and wait
And meanwhile ...
-----------
It's been a year since you've been here
I feel like it was yesterday
Every day you would enter the house
With the smile and the happy look
How like a fool I did not notice you walked away from me
And I only have the longing
-----------
Maybe come back to me you'll agree,
How did you forget me,
How did you succeed enough for me,
I'm already tired of you again,
I'm falling apart again,
Stay away Let me just forget your beauty
-----------
Meir Mishali
Processing:
Meir Mishali
Remember the words, I always whispered, how I would get excited, in front of your eyes / tell me sometimes, you think about me too, because I do not stop for a moment, think of you
I do not know what you're talking about, but I do not know why.
Tell me how long, you kept everything in your stomach, all those nights, I already felt, you were but you were not, your looks betrayed, now that you've gone, what's left for me, tell me
-----------
It was only you that I kept
Love opened his gates
Forever I will wait for you in love until the end of my soul
Just believe it, love me, look at me
Forever I will wait for you in love until the end of my soul
Just believe you will love me all my world
-----------
I am a guest in your world
And I have no more than you
When I call you, I am angry
On the path from your resting team
He fears the distant world
When the day came
-----------
Into her lap
She stole me night and night
She pulled me to her room at night
And kissed
So I began to discover life, a life like that one does not forget
And today she teaches ...
-----------
Everyone tells me they see me
They see me
That I'm in love with you
Only you know everything about me
Everything about me
And how I'm addicted to you
-----------
Now that you're far away
We parted in the hope that you were coming back
A year has passed, I have not heard from you
You left a picture with a smile in the frame
Did I stay with you?
If you remember me Sivan ...
-----------
Where is my youth?
Bring me under your wing ...
And another one for you to confess
My soul was burned with flame
They say love is in the world
what is love...
-----------
He writes you songs
I'll make you wings
Grassland and sea water
Here's one and two
I'll bring you here
And all because of love ...
-----------
Brunette is so beautiful
In your eyes a fire is burning all of my heart
Brunette will call me all seafarers
If they read me again I'll go with them again
Brunette will call me son of father king
If he calls me again, I'll go
-----------
And do not underestimate my feelings
But there was no silence
And my mind was different
The thought of a little girl
That girl I had hoped for
It also caused disappointment ...
-----------
So lonely and orphaned
The song in it also fell silent
What remains what remains
Even today I am a potter
And at night it's cold
And then my eyes went out ...
-----------
The Matador of Seville knelt.
Yes, Senor, as always, it's because of Senorita
Who caught his eye for a moment
And then, even now, in the arena with Abita
I'll see his blood in the dirt.
Matador ... Metador ... Matador ...
-----------
All your looks that said you love
Break with the aim of lying your arrows
Why did I have a failure?
In his own history, he sends it to no one
We did not find that everything was a lie
You're a girl ...
-----------
You could have told me to come in time to sit with you in some garden
But fate did not let you go to the point
My love is tired of living this one and it's your tired of living so tell me
Hello my love
You fell in love with me and you fell in disappointment
But fate did not let you go to the point
-----------
Again he lifted his feet and started again
Onward he continues his wanderings
For a distance he wanders a happy and lonely man
No rice does not throw or worry
Twelve strings give him life
On the roads in the fields and gardens
-----------
Hello come Shabbat ...
Speak at Mount Sinai Fourth Speech:
Remember and save the seventh day,
Therefore, in his love I shall drink my cones,
A day came from those who knew peace and security.
Hello come Shabbat ...
-----------
In your cheeks the light flush, you are so beautiful
And if you have already turned to me you turn
I am excited and stammered and thrilled.
Do not turn your back on me
I'll look at you with longing eyes, you're so different
I did not know how you would be alone
-----------
Dreaming you at night
My mother's knees are over
Only days have passed for you to be faithful
Playing in secret is sure to sing to you
I'll give you my voice
I will bless you in all my days ...
-----------
Against the moonlight
Promises I whispered from the heart
With you I knew a happy world
Who found me cruel and painful
With you I knew a happy world
Who found me cruel and painful
-----------
Because you are my queen
When you laugh around everything glows
They sing you only describes
When your voice whispers, I'm conquering
You carry and fall in love
And I am captive in magic ...
-----------
Living in the house
Maybe it's in my head or something root
I wanted you to be perfect
And I loved you and still love
And I'll love you till I die
I was born with you ...
-----------
Never you and me
And when Libby was already in the sky
Barak's eyes are burning
Your charm and your looks
How can we give up
You're drunk and bold ...
-----------
How it all ended before the start
Tell me how I know, you did not come and this is a riddle
Yes sometimes the person needs a bit of luck and warm attitude
Yes sometimes the person needs a bit of luck and warm attitude
Because life is like a wheel coming up here, going down there
It costs him here, goes down there
-----------
Send legs in dance
Spread wings like a bird and fly to the light
A small bird opened my eyes
Ashir will dance with her to her world
And she accompanied Libby, who was her daughter
Arkoud Ashir with her breathless
-----------
Oh drunken Ho drunk wandering lonely I was my friend
Oh drunken Ho drunk wandering lonely I was my friend
Then she passes before my sad eyes
The pictures of my wanderings in the streets
Oh drunken Ho drunk without any direction just walking
Oh drunk drunk drunk without any direction just walking and the bottle on me in front of you
-----------
The glasses were filled with a drink to drink
The labor of a forgotten day from the worries of running away
The dawn followed a day of light
We shall go out to a day of hard gray work
And at midnight we will return to the inn
Forget all the black days
-----------
Believe me, dear son
Believe me, dear son, everything has been tried
But the burden is heavy
And the thought was heavy
About your future, son
Everything is over ...
-----------
A voice theme year after year
And no one from me is happy
To see a smile rising from a melody
And I will not stop singing for the rest of my life
For this is my way, and this is my life
Being a singer ...
-----------
On a day of happiness
Innocence and honesty
About a sad day that had disappeared
Two thousand cheers
And hands
For which I exist.
-----------
And comes what helps him
The thunder also disintegrates in the direction of the wind
The leaves fall down
And a boat to Ofek sailed
So did you
You will not have time to rest
-----------
To the sun of sand and salt and to everything that is real
Among the vineyards of Thessaloniki
There she gave me her hand
The songs of Salonika
She taught me at night
She went back to find her
-----------
She is light and she rises and has no worries
People like her to fly to the top
Go on up to the top
A man fights and it's hard for him
All his life he aspires to the top
For he is not below
-----------
She is with me and she is still calling for her rescue
And my heart wants, so I go out and my heart wants it so I go out
The pride of my people The love of my mother's house
I gathered in my knapsacks and wrapped myself in my voice
And my heart is full and I pray a rising smile thank God
And my heart is full and I pray a rising smile thank God
-----------
She is the woman among the women
Very beautiful
When God gave me her hand
My whole life has changed for me
Who was every night alone
She sits and waits for me
-----------
Night Light Night The candle is burning
I motion for her to come
Between rooms are orphaned memories
How we built how we destroyed there too
The memories in my soul are gnawing
We were there and there we also liked it
-----------
Get up, man ...
White days will come
And we'll sit down and tell the grandchildren
How we dreamed of a day of light
And we vowed to keep him
Get up, man ...
-----------
You love me aching and do not give up
Yes we met, but later it was love without tomorrow
To love and not to touch
Just pat a glance
It's still painful, you know
You're my one, it's love
-----------
And I did not feel when
It did not happen that morning
Neither a sunset nor a beach
She crept into the silent darkness
And can not disconnect
Without feeling penetrated into my heart ...
-----------
Remember only her eyes and remember only her face
She wants to go back to her without me
Ahh without her
Night without a rest I can not find
Night and night only to her, only her heart goes out
Only her
-----------
And when night comes, it hurts me to wrap
Now I am broken into a thousand pieces
I'm lost getting lost
I would try to change my life
If only you could come back to me
I feel like a sea in a storm ...
-----------
And come, come near me.
What do I have in my days and what are my whole life?
What do I have all day? Why my God?
If only it were a never-ending dream
Another day that came and passed
Why leave so alone ...
-----------
Please stay here by my side
God give you to me Nathan
Look at my eyes
Eyes never lie
I know I was wrong
Like everyone else, I'm just a person
-----------
The horizon is changing
Ships anchored in the heart of the bay
A captain opens another sail
Rainy the way not see
Just change and change
Let me be with you every minute ...
-----------
You're so different,
What is your secret?
That pulls me tight.
I do not fantasize about it
Just understand that this is not a game.
Like a girl ...
-----------
At night I fall drunk in dark dark streets
At night my whole body could not sleep with tremors and fears
Only in my mind where did you disappear
What is sad for me?
And you will know that without you I am dead
Sad tonight ...
-----------
Gathering me when I crumble
Look at me and see that I am
Split and the other half
By fire and water I shall be a wall for you
I will give my life for you a soul
And there is no love in the world anymore ...
-----------
There was silence
And we looked at each other
It was sad
The heart was hot
And we parted with hope
All this was yesterday ...
