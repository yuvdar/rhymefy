Close to the borderline
The magic of the desert is captured by the pillar of fire before the camp at the beginning
The water line will be removed and the fire will not burn
Flame and blade
Like a free bird wants to touch the sky
Close to the end line
The desert was thirsty
The spring is dry with burning channels
51 ------------------------- 51
Jaffa D. Left of the Bells Nine
And up the twelve steps
They knock on the door and the lady opens
Where is your daughter Yardena?
Hello Jordana I'm here already
I also waited and hoped and was happy
The edges of your shoes will spread out
Tie your bike and make your heart
I was friendly and thank you for telling me
Wait a moment to avoid a hazard
Do not forget about a hat
To protect and not to serve
52 ------------------------- 52
I would get off at the old station and I would have another country
Reality is waiting when rain falls
This descent into the warm street was a path for me
Of a familiar drunk from a cold heart with peanuts and a red syrup of sugar
A belt at ten and a gift tape for grape juice and a waiting paper
A cinema that shows films of lewdness and a Persian hat with embroidery
Suddenly belongs and sometimes another in a crowded world and in a hurry
In the avenue of cheap shoes in falafel stands with all the extras
Public services that smelled far away taxi drivers who did not learn to remain silent
Drunk and blind looking at the world
Avrechim earn a free mitzva
On the way to brilliant Tel Aviv, he stops in the cracked reality
53 ------------------------- 53
Luckily you always play Solomon with yourself
Baruch strokes the cords of your love, what luck
She understands me and shows me
Enthusiastic like a child indulging in you
And then he stays with you
At the end of every night he came
The secrets of your modesty allow me to study
You felt sorry for me like a mother
You won everything with me
Immersed in the hidden in you
Loves what is visible
Work for your wisdom and you have nothing sane
54 ------------------------- 54
Even in the early days of history when the world existed only in theory
And did not distinguish between tomorrow and the day before yesterday
There were many where you should put sun and only one thing was agreed upon
If the stubborn person has no chance of compensation is what happened
I got down on my knees and believe me I've all learned what it's just and I was insulted
Since then many bridges over the water have already made up lunch
They did not yet know about the globe what a round square was like to him
But one thing they knew and immediately determined if she refused was no hope
Today you will find that the subject for any argument is what came first the egg or the apple
One says the sky is running out
When there's enough air for a country or two
Debate
55 ------------------------- 55
Soon you will almost give one body
My hand is forever mine until I'm scared and so my whole body shakes all night
Day and night all the time in one unmarked lane
Together and leave you a loyal self
Love you tonight and with you become sad and excited until the heart of hope and pain comes closer
Slowly we will discover a little who may learn to give up to give more
Until only our love remains
Soon
The light will rise drunk
We want you to remember
Keep until the end days
Until the drums were beating and the drumbeat died
56 ------------------------- 56
Who will light the light?
Which way and in which shirt to where the road he crossed
Follow him here alone and in the meantime everything is against me
There is no choice
What was so special about him was that he realized what was loose in me so that he held on
A long way I passed I have a goal
Private without return I do not care what they say it does not matter
No one in my home place for me will build
A cold night a corridor lit by a weak light like a detective
I went to get you dressed late. Do not be stubborn anymore
57 ------------------------- 57
There are no horses who speak Hebrew people who do not die
Search Antarctica
There is no palace in the middle of Hayarkon Street There is no prince living with me in the room
There is no snow in Africa
Light love is coming
If you ask her to win
Standing here with you is not your princess forever
Says there must be more
It's mediocre. It's not enough for me. There's no romance here
58 ------------------------- 58
I have my own room and the room has light
It is not now or in black
It lasted almost a week or already a few days
If you ask me why it's deep inside
You will get over so tell me the voice hit and fall anyone can
We are all allowed to be weak and do not shut your ears and close your eyes and leave hands
Even in difficult times
In which I rest how much this will last as long as it takes
Meanwhile
59 ------------------------- 59
Do not understand
Just a little girl
What do they want from you?
Everyone calls on your behalf
Do not be naive
In a red dress and two braids
A lonely little girl
She stood and asked why
And all the soldiers and all the cannons
They stood pale-faced and found no answer
60 ------------------------- 60
I have no rest without you
My days are gray
Meaning what you mean
Why must I hurt so much to take everything I have nothing left for myself
You entered my life without warning
A form of form frightens me
Tables and chairs TV the same picture
If you could plan a trip
How afraid to get used to the fear of giving in
61 ------------------------- 61
You must not think when you're so tired
Go for a walk by sunrise
Far from home the trail to return deleted
Walking on a tightrope The nights are long without knowing why
Run away and there is no pursuer
Soon a boy running to you is holding you
The park would just stop thinking tired people running down the street
We've been here before in the role of reverse fast walking and exhausting body
There is a breach in the fence
Between the vines
Between the grapes of the vineyard
Foxes and howling terrorists disappear
62 ------------------------- 62
You know you do not hear words anymore
Now is the time of numbers then some
It costs to remain innocent
And how hard it is to buy some gratification can not travel anymore
Outside, everything always comes back
What they did to our song is good and pleasant
Life no longer sees face
So how simple it is to sit with brothers
At a table set together
63 ------------------------- 63
Waves of moon sands watching the desert
The path leads from today The road will lead to tomorrow
Bathed in beautiful sand dunes like an oasis of desert
Maybe I'll see you again between dirt roads
So go
Let the sand burn everything
Your eyes will meet mine
Like a sea touching a beach
Your lips
They'll touch
On my lips
64 ------------------------- 64
The crackers of your voice are singing together in the forest and in the wood
Play me Ronnie Alzi In your spring, this boy is going to smile
Because for many days they will not ignore it
One day you'll come and tell me
Take my hand, O son of grace, Come right away, and we will marry there in the mountain of Tubal in Birk, for me to build the nest
After all, you know and know every person that I will be you, and you will be mine too
In my eyes, look what in your heart I knew I knew your secret
Anna goes left wondering
Even in the meantime the sun had sunk
Soon a star and a white would sprout
And when night came
I'll whisper love to you
65 ------------------------- 65
Ginat Egoz
Get up please
Towards my friend and hurrying
Member and Tanna
She changed and changed
His secret to my heart was awakened
Willingly and lovingly
They go to the Midrash with affection
With whom the Shekhina floats
66 ------------------------- 66
A dream says and laments food
I am less than that and who is
But if you believe it, you will see how another will arise because you are destined
Who would be able to tell, however, whether the peaks or peaks would deteriorate
Describe the way and you will not be tormented by all this knowing but be careful
It does not matter what they say at all if a young person with a little luck
Obstacles to you do not fear, because alone paving the way for tomorrow
We will not bring a contract for both you and you
For everything is in your hands, all that is in your heart
In the path of your life, it is your destiny
Do not go gossiping and my lips will not go with you through stray fools, this is not your way
And until now you have already reached that you have done enough is that the shadow passing will surely pass
67 ------------------------- 67
How beautiful her eyes are the fire of flame
Glances sent fire into her heart
Lee Nagano asked me to play loudly
We will not stop saying until the light comes up
Your hand is swinging in the rhythm and magic
She swims like a dreamer into a spoon of shame and charm like a winged bird
Suddenly, like a relentless wave of sea, it roars
She immediately slips away like a butterfly
The veil she had kept secrets
I have two glowing eyes
Her hand reaches into the circle
A happy boy chooses her
68 ------------------------- 68
Screaming to the sea and its waves where my love is now
Above them fly gulls of bad news bring
The fishermen went down to the sea and my lover went with them
Sailed to the great sea waiting for him on the sand
Somewhere in sight on his boat my heart pounding wants him
A wind kisses the image of my hand
Return from the sea my love did not return
The sea devoured his boat and my heart sank with him
The sea took him to him and I will never see his face again
His destiny is sealed and his image rises before his eyes
69 ------------------------- 69
The outside is gray and the room is cold and it hurts it is not the same beautiful world and everything becomes more difficult
The thoughts are hopeless so do not think harder than the thought that you might have loved
Just open your heart to love about you just think
To you I wrote the melody in the rhythm of the heartbeat
And I could not live more than a day like a dream
That I had wreathed a bouquet of roses Accept me for another good hour Perhaps we would live together for years
My ship will call on your behalf ready everything to give you your love if you just give a little of you
Everything will blossom around him
Angels on a harp will detail
That loves you
Just For You
70 ------------------------- 70
My sweet soul is the only one that turns me on
With you is the entire universe universe
Without you half a person is really nothing
One of his to close a circle with him
Will come and fall in fate like a garment for the body to breathe
In the madness you find solace
A dream that seemed to be a battle
Will come and stir your heart
Water to thirst
To hope despair
In a sea of ​​coolness
They have love
71 ------------------------- 71
Her lover escaped
Awaken and embrace the worst solitude
Just walk around with the dog on the avenue
Muttering quietly how well it was
Between days
Busy lightning stretch time
At nights in a smoky club
Sinking lost and finding no interest
Alone and good my whole life is no happier than me
To which the sadness connects
Except for me, I have no one else
That's why I do not mind lying anymore
72 ------------------------- 72
Even when you go through some addict you do not understand
Like a little girl, I'm spinning. Tell me what happens to you until you come to me
Maybe it'll be a little late. Come on, do not let me go
Between the old houses and the green fields
I dreamed that I found you among people so different from worlds so distant
I almost lost my way
Between the similarities between fears and madness of life
I dreamed I'd found you for days
All those changes
73 ------------------------- 73
Invites us to the opposite of each other and only complains about the heat and what heat we might ask
Live in a rented apartment just close to the expense account tonight do not go to sleep
Tel Aviv before midnight The wind does not want to blow and the humidity does not let me choke A coffee shop between the neighborhoods has not yet turned off the lights
On an old chair alone, she is not sure what to say about whether to go back
A wind comes from the sea and casts a small glance at me inviting to sit down
Rise in a stairwell and bring out keys that open a door
A small table Two armchairs ask what you would like to drink
Feels just like a character from a two-glasses film on the pouring table
I open another white wine
Throwing me a little smile to my heart slowly enters
Everything that happens between us turns on an air conditioner because of the heat
Maybe we'll go to the room if we want to stay here and sleep, too
74 ------------------------- 74
The moon's shadow to the sun's surface continued
Always between night and day you touch up there and it's not enough for her for just a moment
And so every day countless years died in the light of sunset and pink sunrise lost love
Surrounded by the seven planets burning to the pallor of his face
So distant in the skies of the earth but yearning for the golden fire
Often in despair
Darkening for a moment
A hot eclipse
But in this pursuit
Skyscrapers
Prisoners in their tracks
No consolation
75 ------------------------- 75
Katsav raised his hands with a big party. The night is free and happy
Come on hands better dance in two love singing
I have a sea of ​​power and can not find rest because I do not have a girl
I put two gourmets and a Cartier watch in honor of whoever is destined
Everyone knows I have a special charm many women have had but will always be alone
On the mirror depends on me a disc of the group because I have always given all my love
A year ago, I met Shankin at a girl who had many reasons for not being her
I put a gel in the pony and a earring on the eyebrow I thought I found love nonetheless
But she saw me as a mediocre man who was not northern to a local Pacino
I quickly realized that my way was right
I returned the cubes and returned to the neighborhood
Afraid to touch you
76 ------------------------- 76
I do not know what's happening to me and it's shaking me hot and cold
The words get confused
Really stupid as a silent stuttering shoe and unlucky
The words come to an end
Just like an amoeba acting like a naughty six-year-old maybe
We want to stay home
Lying on the bed does not take off his shoes
Bum is not going anywhere
Sticking to me from a goofy look
Waiting patiently for you to smile at me
Love takes me out of the ordinary tools and can not find words
Going out the sounds dominates life
77 ------------------------- 77
You would love to sing
Quiet for a few years
If I were wearing a white dress
And similar to the girls of the neighborhood
She gets a round ring
The glass breaks under the canopy
I would not turn around
Whole days without an address
I'd be in a hurry like a lady
You're getting better
Doing what fits
Age and neighbors
78 ------------------------- 78
Say that it's cold, I do not have anything good, you'll go, and it's not so bad
Saturday Sessions and Balcony
Seeing from there children playing games catch
Makes coffee still silent and see that you have not slept
what does she say
Evening comes early and dresses
The sea is already gone Children walk in the rain
He asks where she is going
outside
The storm
So what
She says
Games ------------------------- 79
Buy me a gift only once a year
Do not forget what you want to drink today. Drink with me
Pick me a flower that will bring a bottle made me happy and know
Love
So much joy Come to the party Come and see that I love
Not so bad every year Celebration Why do not you light candles on the cake
Take me to a movie or a show
You will see that you have not forgotten what you promised
80 ------------------------- 80
Take my hand in your hand and tell me
Let's go down to the garden
Things you see from there not from here
You played me a song on the guitar and your voice trembled
The spirit of me rose and the time seemed to stand
She still remembers every taste and smell of the field in the moonlight
The voice of the jackal from the wadi and the weight of the fruit in the orchard
I was alone and my ways were lost to me and you came to me in time
You gave me a hand and gave me a way to many things
You brought a beautiful smile like a flower and force to believe
The song that sang the good part of everything you said
An angel and a devil would stop time
81 ------------------------- 81
Yes, that is what my town looks like if you stop, maybe you'll see me
You already know that time is not necessary
An old street at midday with red-roofed houses beside it
In the barbershop sitting opposite, Adom is getting a haircut
Passover train cross a field and a bridge over the tracks crosses
A hotel without a window
The tin volume is cut
A few more holes drilled
Building a window for a hotel that makes a living
Mrs. Schmidt the butcher's wife
Always says this is the situation
Weeds Dogs and cats
82 ------------------------- 82
He assured me that a warm winter would never exist
The poplar tree balding in front of a transparent puddle
In front of my window a sudden rain brings me into myself
They say that this year will be drought but from summer I came as from defeat to winter flight I got on the run
A wind came into clothes on a laundry line
On the balconies opposite me
Sometimes rain sprayed on soft saplings
There are scattered rains all over the country
But again I found a house
A tree in a garden
A city so small
And nothing has changed
83 ------------------------- 83
When the stars fall, the curtain of fog opens
The days are good with the consolation coming with you
So close to me at the end of the war
It was almost autumn now
In the sky one light shines
So long with me
As if you were always here
You loved me slowly
You may have glanced
I would make promises
I was daydreaming
Relaxing the breath of the sea The blue horizon disappeared I did not sail
84 ------------------------- 84
She said it would be nice
Tchernichovsky six hour five will come alone
Can not find your description is vague and should not apologize
Yes, the city is big and it's impressive
Crossing it is like plowing in a minefield
I want to hug you tight in my arms if you want to come to me
Caterers are a pleasant breeze in your hair
You'll love me a second time
There are cotton fields
There is also despair
Finding you is like reaping in an abandoned field
Desperate looking at the city cursing to go to hell
85 ------------------------- 85
Recently almost every face looks like a dead end
Every day that passes, it becomes clearer how much is missing
Give me a reason to hug you
White nights come to you
Let's run away without you
Now she slept like a sad mouth
Who had stolen all the magic
Remote disconnected and paralyzed
The heart explodes into pieces
86 ------------------------- 86
We have love
You would have believed, after all this desert, some consolation
See you lying on the bed in the dark
All the windows are open and the light illuminates us silvery and milky
Here is your face and noble smile eyes
Fears cut off concern for me
Happy that here together
Imagination becomes reality
You can almost touch a memory in a figure
Know right not mine
but now
In the dark with me
87 ------------------------- 87
As I came I went all dreams
Maybe I was not there to love
I must have forgotten I might have gone far and can not love you closely
We'll burn all the time between us
Let the passing of the past pass before us
The thirst for love and hunger that persists
There is a lily in it with a thorn and a small scratch in the heart
You came to me
You went to me
I was forgotten
Going
Apparently it is
88 ------------------------- 88
It gives me strength at night only with you
Your heart will not be complete and want
If you do not wait for me at the end of the day
Be an hour dream
If you leave me in the end
What remains will be uninspired
I can not tell you a snake whispering to you I have a tear
Go from me to another field I will not give you maybe wrong
I will never find your footprints
If everyone says leave
I will not stop going for you love
Be close and we will be good
89 ------------------------- 89
Heroes galloping soundlessly on a screen in the corner of the room in a forgotten film
Sitting alone does not know anything about the bar
The glass of wine is empty The palm on the bar is drumming along with a sugary song
About a young girl and the broken heart
The dream that has been forged has not really failed, only the thread that has become entangled now
It's hard to untangle and it's hard to draw
The heart on a napkin that the pen is wrinkling
The wailing guy from the sugary song ends with an oath not to forget anything
Forgotten in the second and swallowed up in the past continues
The story is never the one that is told outside the words and the song ends
The heart did not crack and broke
Pulsing as usual in the familiar rhythm
90 ------------------------- 90
Everyone is shouting a pit
Believe only one drink I drank
I tasted so little that I forgot my worries
And I carried my voice
Oh friends and tourists listen to me
As miserable as I am, I will suffer
Some say I was right but most of them claim I'm crazy
Until my clothes were torn and my eyes were tearful
They eat cowboys if not now when
I drank drunk
The third third of my life, until I was in a state of agony
Police guards imprisoned me for such a life until I suffer
91 ------------------------- 91
Valley of Flowers I will pick thousands
Red roses on your head
A valley of lovers where we would only rest
Love is a life
The wheels of the carriage brought me to the sound of chime bells
Whoever would have believed this would surely welcome me with all my soul
Please come to the valley where you are under the tree and lie down and think only of you
Your figure has grown in my dream and swept with me all my soul
In my little room is my picture
Around the frame there are always flowers
Your little world will not penetrate it
We designed the valley with poetry over
92 ------------------------- 92
Give up and forget even if it's hard for both of us together as long as we change
There is no need to escape Truth to smear Never change this world
The road to happiness is long
Full of obstacles
A time to smile and to rejoice
How beautiful life is
My two eyes carry up
Asking for answers to questions
No reply
No one knows either
the mother
At the end he met
93 ------------------------- 93
Special
Pressing government pressed
People crying prices rise to pay taxes and also sick fund
There is no work in the empty coffers There is nothing to live and have taken a closed office
In the Knesset sitting on us workers took savings and went to compensation
We've been fed up and screwed us another fine even on the added milk tax
Demanding money
We have only ministers who want to do nothing but promise
Where is the equality of vision, which is a disgrace?
What I will sing to you and what I will tell There are many things we will give up
Despite the mess and the disadvantages
Our country for generations
94 ------------------------- 94
Moonlight The melody of a violin will enchant the heart
Ascending trembling sound emanates from strings spilled pain
A violinist played the great darkness and quiet around him
Your tunes will make me forget
To the sound of your sounds what a pleasant dream
There will be a celestial moon in the heavens
My heart is a sheep, and you have left me a painful lover suffering
The violin was hidden a moon in silence The echo of a melody still sounded
For what and why a god knows a cruel and evil world
A beloved figure will appear in the mists of dirt
Familiar features
A violin would play a song of such pleasant memories
95 ------------------------- 95
I only have a dream of seeing you smile again
There is love in me. A close relative knows that I love and love only me
But the memories in the suitcase are thinking of her
Not running away does not know remains lost
If there is no love bread, the traveler will arrange for us a future
How Long Can I Live Without Work Time does not help me
You promise
That I would soon succeed
We can live without worries
Money does not matter
But know
That if missing there are problems
96 ------------------------- 96
And you read a flower and eyes I remember a soul
Only with you above I floated in the sky and suddenly fell to the ground alone
There is nothing left but the longing for time passes slowly for an hour or so
For almost a year now the world has been calm and only my voice is screaming now
And now the wounded heart is such an old story
Life flowed
Everything was permanent
How we sang then
In two voices without shock
There were nights of laughter
And amusement
But now I have a torn cord in my voice
97 ------------------------- 97
A day and another night for the rest of my life
My love will always call you until I close my eyes
As in the fog I was without you The world seems clear since you came
You lit my life with one eye
Remember for a moment I disappeared I could not speak a show
I picked up two words and told you
Your warm gaze touches not touching
Penetrating into the heart slowly
I never doubted it
98 ------------------------- 98
You bought me, you were sure everything was falling apart
Razor painfully sharp because you were sure that flowers hate
You stopped singing songs of the homeland and ripped off all the nice clothes in the evening
You were missing and now come back again is not for me for me
You wrote me a song like he likes
Naked and weak words that you have not said for years
What you thought of yourself and me was not exclusive
You read my name on the cold nights
You wanted me to be with you in the evening
You destroyed a city of joy
You knew in love
It's probably not me
99 ------------------------- 99
