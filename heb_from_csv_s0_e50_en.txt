All the salary goes to the grocery store
Every day my wife buys a dress
Of course there was a new example
Except for socks and a purse
Suddenly she wore a turtle pattern
Loves to live in debt
Tell me what to do
One thousand pounds
Interest notes
We want to change the curtains
Table chairs
She bought a couch and slept alone on the floor

Blue sea city in the sand
It's all just one of you knows
The tower is on a kneeling hill
A hut on the seashore sinks
The port has retired There is no orange and no Valencia
volume
Evening Eve wakes up
He woke up and put on makeup
A thirsty man thirsts for illusions
In the sky above him are his stars
The city of falafel pizza steaks
A city with a thousand discos

From Afula we came together on the train Friday
I have herring in a plate and a hairstyle
I wear a Shabbat dress with a leather purse in my hand
Mom how nice it is
Yehuda promised her that he would keep her faith as before the wedding
Honeymoon Before The Wedding Tar After Honey
The groom wants to be a father to Mahaleleh Darsh
Why circumcision and still a virgin
But the husband could not remember how he had had a son
Rejoice late
The Rebbe was both interested and denied it was impossible
We wait until he grows up and asks where you came from
3 ------------------------- 3
When will I run toward him?
When will I feel his hand?
Letters did not send DS at all not a message Please help me my friends
Why everyone is silent
Why not talk?
Is not he alive?
Wavy for you
I will light a candle for your soul
But where is your grave?
Earth your figure
When will I hear your voice?
I think we'll be here

No one can know or predict
And do not ask to learn
All you have to do is watch
And in the future, hope will be fulfilled
From the beginning of Heaven to the world
Since the water line and man dreams of beautiful music
This is true for all his life
God sits up in thought
How far you exaggerate the images
Look for a star solution
And live forever
What is certain is yesterday
5 ------------------------- 5
The dumping will also pass
And again you will see a new spring happy for you
We will add dropouts with everyone
The chicken was raised like a dove into a cloud
That's how we'll fall until dawn and wake up
Thoughts of tomorrow night will give up
We are tired enough and we have enough
Forgetting a secret from the heart of wine is not lacking
If your mind is tired and your luck stops
Illuminating his face here and there failed
You will not know between laughter and tears
Who will choose and everything is suddenly given near fate
6 ------------------------- 6
Road dust in curls Please please keep it on me
I gave him everything he loved, embroidered with gold thread
I'll keep my love for safekeeping
Oh boy, when is my answer to my house?
I waited all night in the station
You promised that it would be over a year
Dawn was not coming when she came back to me
I made a bouquet of roses from garden flowers
Ateret and Tiferet to the head of my son-in-law
7 ------------------------- 7
God give me only
Love in my heart
My fate and the cruel world give comfort inside me
I do not want palaces of gold
It's enough for me in a hot corner
Give me a guy who will only love me and give him the soul
How long had my voice heard my prayer? I was tired enough in my life
My life is so gray and my nights cold
So lonely and sad
Only dreams remain
Give me some light joy
Dark Ages They built me ​​a path to my home again to return
8 ------------------------- 8
Just wait another night
The city lights are on and there is no more darkness
Look at you so beautiful tonight I want you to be my bride
All the words of love will be in the film
I'll give them as a rose too
For you I will forget my weaknesses
The violins will give you a different feeling that closes my eyes. This blind love is also my life
If you want to talk tomorrow I return to the warm corner of your heart
Give me peace of mind and strength to continue living my life on your side
Try to understand and believe otherwise I did not love you except you
Just give me
Live by your side
9 ------------------------- 9
Hello and thanks do not call me do not answer
If you call me downstairs I'll call the police
So get yourself a life because you have no choice
Get out and dry in the sun
I do not want you here in the apartment
Everything we had last night
It had suddenly turned terrible
I thought it would be heaven you thought you caught a wave
You have to be tied to another rope that is not loyal at all
We had a short love but you got into trouble
I'll send your mail to the company you'll find next week
I have been given a title like Farooq without work
10 ------------------------- 10
What a party how much love
Everyone flies beautiful
There is no one who does not dance here from Athens to Eilat
Fire in the earth is hot in my soul
When she sees her, I no longer have breath
Some body girl dripping with sweat
Ranting and dancing all around her
You came from the East with the beauty of an angel
All my friends fell into your trap
Here's a flying mad pace every expansion is burning and I'm burning
How beautiful and frantic attracted to her as into a storm
11 ------------------------- 11
Because without you it's so hard
Normal that is always here for me
He always remembered how you told me
Can not leave you for a moment
When I was a boy, I did not leave
And on the nights of a cold winter he always remembered
How would you wrap me in love?
Now it is so lacking for me that the years have passed and I grew up a bit
Waiting for Shabbat to come and bless you and keep me
The way to life
Do not be angry because like everyone else your chick should go
Walk to the world
12 ------------------------- 12
How long it will take you to understand me
How long it will be before my tears stop
Without words cause to stay
Without hope for a reality that would end
Then a minister comes to you
Come and want to rest between your hands
Do not leave everything
Let yourself understand
Let it never happen again
Let the time come and you understand me
Then a tear will pass and again you will come to my lap
Without a pain cause to face and stay between my arms fall in love
13 ------------------------- 13
Leave a glass back to your house
In the heat of summer falls in love with the softness of her lips and relishes
Knows how to spend drinking only whiskey
Drink you to pain and feel
Enough of the nonsense, babe
All life dance and only rejoice
What joy and love there is in it
Tired drunk and not clever the woman left alone
The friends who drove you crazy
The same you will find at this safe and leave a cup to come back to yourself
Between life and imagination, he walks between you and my home
Coming home is sure to reality into my life
14 ------------------------- 14
If you do not want me leave immediately
Grabbing a runaway train
Do not look for me coming back alone
Not leaving you for the rest of your life
My love listened to the lark
Meir is living here one more day on the way to my side
How it ends at the end
This day passes almost like and sometimes
So tired and angry wiping a tear
Go back and collect the shrapnel
After all this we might sail to some island on the coastline and the children would wander
Red lily I'll pick your hair with a canopy of stars on top of you
15 ------------------------- 15
Just like to go leave me
Because now that autumn leaves there is rain left outside
Even if you say it's not worth it, there's no time for you
If you just want to feel at home
Black is your bra, softly
You will not cry tonight I will sit beside you I will give you a shoulder
Ask me to run away
I'll open up a little girl for you
If you ask
I have to forget
I'll give you a cheek
A last kiss
16 ------------------------- 16
One day he was born there for a walk in the forest
And embroidery from the threads of gold, the son of a small king, a stepmother, and a white horse
A small house and the gate opened
A tired princess fell asleep on a beam of light
A guest came on a black horse
Why not now what will probably come only tomorrow
There was no white horse princess in the woods
No legends were ever just a dream
Not happily but to this day there was no peace
Like a summer dream
17 ------------------------- 17
Rider will not get caught alive
Yes she remembers her riding with me
Leaving perhaps my eyesight was standing there perhaps laughing
And he built her a house
The sun rider in my back feels you with me as if now
Time is following me and already touching me and there is no way to continue riding
Maybe I'll come back
At noon
He is older and remembers me
Not sad when a dream is over
Because you stay
18 ------------------------- 18
Two red apples fell on soft grass
They rolled curled up in the grass
They hummed and slept so well
What apples can already be demanded
Sometimes he wants autumn to come now
That everything is behind your back and from now on
Just lie quietly on your back
They dreamed for a full hour of flying like birds into the sky
They whispered with Mother Earth
What is possible?
demand
One or two apples
19 ------------------------- 19
Hear again in moments of peace
Janice Joplin sang an old blues on Bobby McGee
A chamber quartet plays clear music
Passing back those familiar chills of pleasure
But soldier and do not cry for me girl
Adds go to inserts for narrow path and pulls up long and bumpy generations
Birds' leaves glide free
And the wind in spaces like a challenger
I loved moments of fond memories and longing on the table
Chekhov's stories are useless
A man disguised as a soldier in a straitjacket
The moments of solitude Expect years Crying on two hearts Love and far
20 ------------------------- 20
Until I appeared I was a little sad
When I arrived I looked for more love. I did not believe it was possible to love
Suddenly I turned on or how good it was
The sun shines at five o'clock then begins to dress
Something inside me is excited
I have a green T-shirt with a tight tee on my body
Why suddenly she blushes
Two birds in a cage of gold
At night I almost saw a star
I do not dream how good it is
Arrange everything in the closet
We drive down the street among a crowd of people
21 ------------------------- 21
An existing dancer takes a yacht in heat
If we do not dance we'll jump into the sea and we'll all cry
Dancing your sister's customs
Mantel ass jumps and hides behind a tree
With like a moron came the world
Middle East samba dances for commander and magistrate
A bottle pulse on the head of a writer one two three
Making hand gestures like David to Goliath
Dollar Treifes until tomorrow George Washington with me as they poured him Didier
Dances in despair over the consolidation of occupation
Trouble that does not remember piano
Artist
22 ------------------------- 22
Who was born in a detached village and did not hear of heat or suffocation
Good oil name
So quiet he came to sleep
I smiled at me in the bushes resting
Do not like
I just love playing
He sees us singing and we do not hear what we're talking about
Write to me what you want through your ear and eardrums
Inside your head there is silence
You were shot in a blinding light and you would not hear a siren experiment
Do not prevent fire in the fields because she has heavy ears
Accept me between the words paths
23 ------------------------- 23
The Chosen People
I lied that I said everything was wonderful because nothing was actually true
Even our ball that became a square forgot that it was round
The rock and roll business
Why a stone in Ramallah deviates from its path
In a box of singing a dancer in the center
Thousands of mercenaries gather in a mosque talking about me but not with me
My neighbor's uncle received a deputy battalion commander who told my nephew's wife
Shamir and parsley meet in the dark to solve the current situation
In New York invented a new breed of disease one man claims my brother
In San Francisco bridges need recovery in Russia and another train disaster
The masses knocked down a wall in Berlin and I and you can only hope
24 ------------------------- 24
As we shall never love again
Again the first rain plays his song on the window
Reminds me last winter we embraced when it was cold
Remember a kiss at an old train station
You should have gone back to the village
My tears a cloud broke
I will not forget the letter you hinted that someone stole your heart
When you say you want a little alone
I realized I would not see you forever
I know I'll love you
If you hear
me
25 ------------------------- 25
Next to me goes diving
A distant one begins to run
You see my way through me
Want continuous points
falling apart
More complete
Waves came pain
is broken
Sometimes I have them all
Not here anymore
Want to wait right away
Air breathe
26 ------------------------- 26
Know moving moves hits my heart There is a hole that can not be closed
Everything the world offers must be sufficient
As long as the air arrives, it does not bother me and caresses me
You have a light to stop
As long as it comes as long as he's sweating
I'm sure I'll come back
You'll probably wait for me
Must be enough
Everything that broke up rage
All we dreamed of
Anything that tastes good
And pampering me
27 ------------------------- 27
The first evening of talking sits and writes you a letter
For all the things that were exactly what happened
The letters appear on the wall and a pleasant fear to recognize
The characters like to play moving here in the empty house
I do not know how much I tried to hide
All nightmares are screaming and blood on the uniform
I do not understand why it was long ago
Pictures run from that night
Tears
Lying thinking did not fall asleep
Quiet and slowly playing
Now you're devoting a song without a name
28 ------------------------- 28
About what dreams burning in your heart
How good that you came together is complete
In the eyes that see everything there is nothing painful
Years are running like water straight to nowhere
Run far and be close
Day turns into night
Hold tight and never leave
That time does not stop flying and burned a smoke screen was a tree Catch a moon and a whip on a cloud
It's time for your shine to know and touch everything
World Dementia Do not be afraid to fall my child and everything is just waiting for you
Father here always embrace and keep you until the end of the world does not leave you
My child's only you on your way
29 ------------------------- 29
Know magic works in the cinema
He has a birthday present gun
Uses it as he only knows
If you want to be his friends this winter decided to tell
What he has in his heart is what hurts
Next summer will be in Europe
If you want to be his friends soon
It will do you good on the day that you return tired and sad
Remember that there are weaker people
Shivering in the room so do not turn on the light because now it's all right
Safe heart should not rest
Again palaces fall in love with the air
30 ------------------------- 30
See you lying between the white sheets
Climbing through to you Loves you shouting Your hands slipping Satisfaction draws from me to you
Silent laughs Yes there are drops of madness between us
Dripping like a flame of burning flame
Always love you again like honeymoon
Holding me tight as a snake loses control
Shivering and excited
The feeling gives your body a wish
Take me up to you
The fire in you burns an exciting dream
31 ------------------------- 31
Time does not hurt me not afraid to live
Blooms even if you think it is not
You will not find me at last
Even if you dug underground, you would hire a helicopter
I will scream hard until I cut your peace with me
Or will become crazy
You're sick of it
I have
news
For you
32 ------------------------- 32
You do not fall asleep alone. It's hard for me to go to sleep
She embodies a midsummer night's dream as imaginative
Alone, nothing helps
Almost on the verge of crisis when comes back
The shutter is open half a moon peering out the window
Only the wind makes sounds and waves in the curtain
He probably does not remember anymore
You went somewhere else
Time passes lazily The sun comes in the sky
Alone but in the meantime where
I turned on a radio that only brought me more depression
At home, what else do I have but memory?
33 ------------------------- 33
Seeing everything you would surround me in the house and heat
You would have closed me if you could
Nothing matters again
more than everything
He builds walls for me
It's written in a big way and you would let me apply everything
You would love me like nobody can
Wandering between walls
Makes shapes that I will have sky
Only me can not see in the blue
I went hours ago
And it's good for me outside the walls to miss the house
34 ------------------------- 34
My mother tells me that it's not for me at all
That there is reason to worry like a madman tells her that my head is already a complicated eye and pupil does not let sleep
My flower with your finger touch and only put a ring so why yell
Angry wants to break a glass
Walking on the street and getting annoyed in basketball Not interested Does not come to the sea on Saturday All I have is only
Do not say it's lost because from the reserves I'll come with a tank battalion from the right. A cannon like that loves you
Let 's wear it all. White, I' il be your groom. If you 're just saying mine
Give me one sweet smile
Just give me one day to laugh
dream
hope
The joy of love
35 ------------------------- 35
The factory closes
Let's go home
Does not pay
A matter of economics and politics
Matters at the top of the world but not in our matter
As beautiful as it was then even now
We listened to the man who said
And we believed everyone
Who spoke of God
Words
Much
36 ------------------------- 36
Disconnected from order and time
You've come a long way
Nasira was a worry
Swaying from place to place, even blind in the dark
I'm on my way safely
My world is rubbing against your dreamy world, entangled in your dream
Two rolling smoke balls flutter in the breeze
They are raging at heights of great joy
Stars sparkle with your gaze
My fate has already tied two beams of light to your fate
Surfing and excitement want to move on
God also wants to help him
37 ------------------------- 37
Escape to forget my lover's eyes
All night she bathed in moonlight
Glowing stars glue her hair
A faking guitar calls her life
She played one clean chord
When dawn came, she set out on the horizon
All the birds stopped singing
I could not understand then
38 ------------------------- 38
The immigrants descend crashing but higher than everyone else
Nothing touches only your gaze
Loves night with you I can not remember what it is without you
Keeping you good things is also just enough for just one
He picks you all the flowers and my garden blossoms constantly
Keeps you all the secrets you'll come back to me on a good evening evening
A morning light with you opens a door in your heart
Good God knows how much you look at in the evening
Herring a chain of words is afraid of losing her on the way
I'll go with you wherever you want, just do not go too far from my eyes
Eyes open with wounded legs walking with you
39 ------------------------- 39
Flashing in two seconds, my life passes before my eyes
Voices from long after heart say wake up quickly
All the places where you were worlds you saw and discovered
All the questions that you asked sometimes did not dare reveal
All the ways open before you are revealed before your eyes in your life
All questions disappear in a moment now it is clear what is less important
All the memories tears cry
Clean your face from innocence
All the experiences that your days have intensified
Keep your sleep awake at night
40 ------------------------- 40
Coming back because I wanted a bit
I'm happy with everything but I still asked again
Surrounded by super-minute thoughts
Collection of fragments of glass from the floor
Loses limits to sounds and odors
Take up space on the walls and ceiling
So full of dramatic nonsense and idiot
Smiling between the lines aimlessly
So many figures but finds a clear truth
He speaks in deeds alone for moments
Between me and all the people there is a clear line
One big alone sometimes tells a dancing story trembling with fear
41 ------------------------- 41
Like dirt on your feet without you
Not breathing here
Life wins and losses and make a lot of waves
Seeing Yes Not all is so great if you have no choice Let laugh
I can not find any more reason
Faithful to your pain does not escape from your heart
Do not fall asleep Forget the door and the rain threatens to fall on me hard
Look, you want
I'll always give it all
You'll always be here for you
I'll go ride
Hold on tight, do not let us fall
42 ------------------------- 42
Where I lay on your back and your thighs on my stomach
And the brain runs like a donkey in a mezuzah worked
Every day he rips off the board
Sunday sad two happy
Tuesday is a new day
Turns from dust to dust
Black shines a new star
Waiting for the end
almost
you gone
Alone
43 ------------------------- 43
On a chaise longue wafted from the heat
I feel like running away on the wings of the dream
To an unknown bay is a deserted island
A small and tranquil village facing the Mediterranean Sea
The sounds of Piraeus are reminiscent of Haifa
With a bottle of Matthaeus looking so beautiful
Let the sun shine on houses in white
Let the heart only rejoice as in Greece
And a cloud in the sky cruises silently
The blue of the water seeps through the soul
And carried with the wind the smell of salt and honey
A new song emerges from the open sea
44 ------------------------- 44
This is not the way to go
Only through God's gift is your path blessed
The listener does not listen and returns to himself to hurt
A big boy does not understand the world
We do not know how to be smart
He strives up and hovers like a bird
Simulates wings and then falls back
He continues to play with his illusions
Time after time he falls on his face
In one hand he builds a second with a wreck
No way is still looking
Like a drunken man, his legs fail again, as if he did not hurt
45 ------------------------- 45
My parents are pressing when you stop the nonsense
Look for a woman you will marry and quite spend
How long will she continue to travel?
What would happen twice a day?
Love to live young Let us spend
Stop the questions
This is the age to enjoy
Feel free
Joy in the heart
What to do
So live loving
Just laughing and not thinking about anything fun because life is the main thing
46 ------------------------- 46
Do not make him reckon he can not sleep
Like you confused me
How many times tell you that this guy is not for you
For a few moments I will remind you that you cried for him until the end of your soul
People swear I feel that way because of you
He keeps promising not to hurt you or your heart
I heard your stories
I knew all his exploits
I could not believe it
I understood
How suddenly
I wanted you
47 ------------------------- 47
What your secret will show me a way to you
How to be yours wants to be just with you
In recent days he has been unable to function
Feel how slowly becomes lonely
Busy thinking how to escape only with her
Feel like I have no hope and want
The smell of a body keeps me strong inside
The tenderness of having a smile on your face
48 ------------------------- 48
It's so crazy in your eyes that you want to know what's in your heart
Dance with me tonight by moonlight
You take up to the end of the world
Do not understand how I fell in love with you girl
One of your arrows hit me with the aim
And immediately I became addicted to how it happened
My life has turned from quiet to storm
He looks at you for a moment and falls in love again
You have a section that makes me excited
You want so much to touch
approximate
This dance has a beat from the heart
49 ------------------------- 49
I promised to write when I went and did not write long ago
Now I miss a rope that is not here
After I arrived in Jaffa, my hopes were born out of despair
I found a room and a half on the roof of an abandoned house
There's a cot here if the three of us want to sleep, the boy looks out
Perhaps from afar there is one chance for a million that happiness creeps into the window
The end of December and the end of the war winds
The snow suddenly sank here reminds me of forgotten
The wound is still open if you were with me now
I must have told you what a letter would not say
Here if you want you have a home and I will have a lot of you
The laughter of twilight children
50 ------------------------- 50
