To ask forgiveness from the king of the world
I took from the silence, a song for the soul
there are none but Him
The whole of the land is your honor
The Holy One, Blessed is He
And I worked
-----------
We will continue on our way
Together, not alone
How long
We walked without a place
And we lost our way
Now we are here
-----------
Because you always give me a look
Such a calm, so absolute
You look inside me
With you I feel like a dream
Whether it's night or day
I do not want to wake up
-----------
Sing me to the sky
You look me in the eye
Mami, what will I do with you?
I'm happy when you laugh
Bad if you move away
Mami, I love you
-----------
If I left you alone and not happy,
If I hurt you I'm sorry
For you I will die of love only for you,
In your beauty you finger the sky,
For you I will stab my heart in your eyes,
The peace of mind
-----------
You're me all my life
Just do not ever change
Every morning he carries a prayer
That you'll remember me again
If you remember then that's a good reason for you to stay
Let me know ...
-----------
When you're with me
Again, everything sounds important
Everything sounds simple
When you're with me
I thought maybe
You will not leave me
-----------
Escape from myself
The violin plays in my life you hear
The butcher gives me the strength to know how to escape from myself
Because everything is for the best
And that everything could be pink
If only you smile
-----------
And your mother calls, asks
How did I break her girl?
she does not know,
You were my queen, my soul
And all the time I wanted you to smile
Maybe you'll tell her ...
-----------
My two brothers hurt one less
I have no tears left
I wish her not to suffer for you to just feel that I'm passing
I can not understand it. I'm not an enemy
I'm breaking her and crying I do not deserve it
When I sing to her in pain she cries with me
-----------
I'll never go, I'll never go, I'll never go.
Good things take time
Look, we're both here
Learn to live again
And whoever holds you when it's hard is only me who wants to
Get to know you really
-----------
It's good for you to play with me and take what I have
This weaknesses made me so naive
I closed the door and wanted to think quietly
Yes, what you do I no longer have forgiveness
It's good for you to play with me and take what I have
This weaknesses made me so naive
-----------
She'll wait for me to miss you
It will come today.
Again you wanted to come back to me because you were already cold there
And again you were wrong, you thought I would forgive you today
You cry in front of me, I tear too
We must give up, preferably to both of us, just understand
-----------
I live in Miami Israel and the safe will not close
I have the heart of Miami Israel who will take my laughter
Who will cause pain
Live in Miami Israel also a safe will not close
I have the heart of Miami Israel who will take my laughter
Who will cause pain
-----------
And here was the tear
Father, my eyes, you are all my world.
I will always look after my children, as I was after me
I'll always follow you, my daddy
You always knew what was going on over me, healed all my pain
I'll always follow you, my soul, my father
-----------
What the end
What the end
I can not do without you
You are weak in front of the light in your eyes
You are mine in mine
There's no winner here we both lose
-----------
Like a loving fan without pain
I swear I will not let you down
If you weep for the truth of your tears, your smile will look at you
You have never stopped singing to you
Like a loving fan without pain
I swear I will not let you down
-----------
Always smiling and I lose again
You can not go
You are different from all the beautiful in the world
There is no such thing as conqueror
Always smiling and I lose again
You can not go
-----------
It was pleasant
After all, I'm no longer sorry if it is not in my hands
She is in my hands a friend will come today and his past will also hurt
Only then will he understand the feeling
Eli sits up and let me keep aliyah
Please this is my prayer
-----------
Leaves of emotion and a sea of ​​hope
She suddenly remembers days we loved
Why is not she here?
And if she still likes you to come
Hold on and tell me words to calm down, words that will rest
And if she still loves me I'm still here
-----------
Her heart closed on you like a wall
Not looking back,
Keep walking
She'll be back in the future
And it will disappear to you as always
In tears you shouted at her, and she ignores.
-----------
To love you again I have come now.
I swear, I'll fight for both of us
I will remove evil spirits that have entered into our lives, I swear,
I have no other than you, happiness in me touches,
When I'm by your side, I swear.
Nights alone are not easy for you and me.
-----------
The lies in your lips believe every word
How much power in your eyes how can you
One hand on your face hiding your tears
Your entire body trembles as Molly moves
I am the one who will love me more than I do
You tell me what you're guarding
-----------
Do not go right now
Do not leave my heart
Crying out to you and crying, only you the heart loves ..
You're the one, everything
For your sake, ready to suffer
Forgive me even if it is difficult, without you can not
-----------
Who will stop the pain?
Where will my screaming soul escape?
She penetrated deep into my heart today she laughs
I spent days to escape
But her image haunts me
Between all the tears like fire I burn
-----------
There were days struggling
Expect us a future
Give me the urge to fight
I do not care who's to blame
I'm ready under any conditions
Only my heart is jealous
-----------
I and this is not the case that is what the Creator wants
In my eyes, you are not quite the spark of a sense that you are laughing
And pain changes with a look that loves Elijah. You smile
You say in life there are surprises and thrills. It's all from Gd. You do not understand
It is from Heaven that the girl opened the poor
I and this is not the case that is what the Creator wants
-----------
They're all here because of you how you dance
The whole place is shivering and thinning
And I am in front of you standing thinned
My whole body is burning and thinning
He looks at you again and says Delila Delala
And you are in your hands and you are the conqueror
-----------
Designed only for both of us
Come to me
My love for all my life
And if we both dream
Nights and days
We will continue on our way
-----------
A tune comes from my heart chambers
When he stopped me again touching and enveloping me
As a good wine you are offending with time
Like a fairy princess from an old story
Drunk of your love, my heart is only ready for you
I came to you.
-----------
It seems like a dream to me ...
Oh oh oh oh
It seems like a dream to me ...
And she has an outlaw laugh
Going with her the farthest
And all the good in the world did not seem enough to me
-----------
Ala, no goddamn bastard
With you I choke
You're playing a tightrope here
And if you go, you are not a torturer
Ala, no goddamn bastard
Enough, I choke
-----------
Remember all the jokes I could not tell
They were replaced by tears and pain that did not pass
In the streets I stand and shout at you from my mother
And the storms do not end on my own again on cold nights
I was looking for you all over the world
When you are not with me I do not exist as if it does not exist
-----------
Everything goes with you too hard
It's big on me and it's big on me
Because there is no island
My heart is too weak an island
I wish you were with me wish
It's big on me and it's big on me
-----------
So let's have an old dream
It's just me and you alone and in front of everyone
Even if you tell yourself a little
You come for me
Be forever happy
After all you will always be my only
-----------
Occupier of sins, a spokesman for righteousness
We have sinned against you and have mercy on us
We have sinned against you and have mercy on us
Master of the Selichot, examining hearts
A deep exile, a spokesman for righteousness
We have sinned against you and have mercy on us
-----------
To build a wall and a house to complete the creation of the world
Real tranquility in life in smart legal postcards
Only gave me today to understand the wholeness of life
Which is a match between man and woman that comes from the veins of your soul
This is the fate of luck / the wheel that illuminates your blessing
For a moment another hallmark was sealed in the doorway to perfect happiness
-----------
And it's hard because for every minute you're not with me eternity crying
Feeling naked and autumn came early or not
Why are you leaving and why are you coming here?
I am now closed inside myself
I never believed you'd get up and go
Why are you playing with me? Why are you fooling me?
-----------
TIKA TAKA TIKTA The company picks up and this hopa costs her
I just asked you to get it all out with you, even if you do not think so
Do not say not just another drink or two. Tonight I just started in the sky
Everyone long ago dancing is what it does not fit my heart with you but head in the clouds
Because Haida and Yalla mess all smoky and there smiling
Hoppe Breaking the Routine Night Party ...
-----------
I just love you and just love you
He loves you he loves so much
He just loves you and loves you so much
With shameful eyes and a small, occupying gaze
You love without limits from yourself everything gives
With you it's just perfect with you that's the whole world with you
-----------
Do not worry about who I am without you and how she always says
Do not worry about my life and she lies again
There is no one like you in this world. Only you understand everyone, she whispers
You came back early without notice and I'm not home
It's not nice to sweat and it's not summer at all
Where the hell is he starting to squirm and yell
-----------
From time to time I understand you will taste to love
You made me smile instead of laughing
You made me talk instead of keeping quiet
And instead of being an introverted person, you made me scream that I loved you
There is not as big as your heart that I am with me what I need
Just close your eyes and lean on it
-----------
Talk to me in English from now on
With a white ball and a matka on the Sri Lankan coast, I'll like the pictures from Mike Wanaka
Because our cockpit pilot will fly us to ...
It's always the same old story making a face that does not talk
Always ready on a suitcase
From Iceland to Ireland From Holland to Thailand From Berlin to Cyprus in Naples I will shout ..
-----------
On the shore of the sea for hours, we asked him with a laugh how we did not know each other
The same city a decade difference you ever catch
How fate has built our sons much stronger than the two of us
And even when everyone speaks, the whole world will explode
Without words, eyes spoke how beautiful you bite your lips
Pinches myself What if I dreamed I should wake up
-----------
Takes the time until you come back
Every day a little bit came to me
When you come back I again become a person dealing with weaknesses
And I do not need to understand everything already understood does not ask what to do
To escape the emptiness from the boredom of longing that suddenly stabs
It's hard to escape the emptiness of this thirst for you
-----------
I crashed the first night you're not here I crashed
Until yesterday I was king of the world
I find myself sitting alone in the room
Do not understand what's wrong. Maybe you'll come back
And the walls are closing in on me. I do not have silence and sky
Maybe you'll come back
-----------
I'll fix all the damage. Which I caused to you,
How did you cry out? Give me a chance to fix.
Leave another minute to love, how you chose to leave
We were there already.
A passing day does not come back and your smile is missing.
Give me a chance to fix.
-----------
I whistled like a tramp
And if there is no love without end
So how at this end I always find only love
In the neighborhood bar I'm drunk
The glass is empty again calling
You have not yet exchanged a melody
-----------
I just wanted to take
Tell me you're forgiving now
I find myself sitting alone in the room
Because men always cry secretly
I do not understand what was wrong
I was blind and did not get the message
-----------
All your kindness you have left me
One more smile that never ends
Because of you I'm still singing
All the beauty in you makes me look sweet
Without you, you do not know a cold night
Your never ending dream
-----------
When words have meaning
It does not let go of life
And accompany every step until the last days I sing to you
Sound of guitar and drums
Three characters playing
And how much power do you have if not you then what to do
-----------
That this is a little special is my way
And today he is happy to have you
And he feels so safe
Yes you can understand that you have something that touches so much
From the moment you left, happiness also escaped with the wind
Searching at night for your character in a minute goes crazy
-----------
Open all the doors
How do you not ask why why I ran away
And even if I had reasons I should at least say
I'm afraid of the power you have on me
I've always been like that
It's never too obvious
-----------
What will be I do not know the head turns and the heart still thinks of her
All I had for her I gave her I did not give up
She thinks I'm sure her conscience burns and it hurts
Even if you try to forget me, I'll be in her heart
And what about all the years we've gone through, we've got a few more plans
Now we were a little distant and I had to hope
-----------
How beautiful and elegant you received her to me so happy
The one I chose the most love of my life
Night came and with me in front of the beautiful sea to me
With the wind, dance without you
Whatever you want my two eyes I'll give you
I am yours and mine in my heart is besieged
-----------
Willing to swear to her in my life
That I was not for a single night
It's three in the morning and it's cold now
She is wearing a coat and rushing out
In a red car she will return to her house
In this dream I am asleep beside her
-----------
In the background is an old song we used to love
Hear the ways we used to walk
Trying to hear through mutual friends
What happens to you today if you make a living
If there is another guy now visiting you
If it's good for you so far, maybe I should go
-----------
The sun shampoo and flip flops that do
And it costs her
And she knows how to seduce
Catch the look he is hiding calling her
Involve programs already have "Maori bring me fire"
I give her ...
-----------
Both my legs are now failing to see you
Different and happy
My street actions are empty of people
And directions that will lead back to you
For you I will also wait for a complete reincarnation with the felt
I have left behind you
-----------
From a friend to a friend, a little later my brother will be late on my way back
There was a great party there
The morning light has already risen and she returns to her home
The Thighs wore on her cheek and she kissed
We'll meet again so she said waiting for a weekend post
Yes it is a habit
-----------
The bed throws sounds of hope
How I cried at night when I lost her
In an old hotel the piano fakes
The ceiling mirror is cracked with pain
And it was a growing longing
When autumn comes naked you will be gone
-----------
We will be happy to dance tonight
Now we will sing everyone ....
So what do you say maybe it's time to be happy
The resume will stabilize the spirit and dance a bit and forget
Now they're definitely dancing and giving me strength
What mood is still in a safe heart
-----------
Going down to the sea, he fell asleep again on the sand
Forget everything I can not fall in love
For even if he died, he died, the world died
Going down to the sea, he fell asleep again on the sand
Forget everything I can not stay
With a broken heart
-----------
To whom I would sing
I wanted a happy moment
Only you to see do not close your eyes
And certainly not sleep at night
And always the first to tell you how beautiful you are
Where can you get some more power?
-----------
And open your heart chambers again
Maybe it would be better for one without the other
Far sweeter and less painful in the soul
Do not regret every second with you
And do not forget the good in you
Good memories from you with me will take
-----------
If you love me
Cololo What a night
She does it to her
Whatever she wanted
Come on, come home
Do not tell me you said
-----------
Just let me mention
my name is maor edri
I'm also very pleased
Maybe you do not know then I'll tell you a secret
I'm doing almost happy in the whole city
Maybe we'll fly on beer tonight still young
-----------
And the days that pass are even more crushing
The self is captured in the felt that remains
In the most difficult moments, you are silent again
You departed from me and the soul is with you
Since you left, I have not found a moment of silence
Nor does he find a single drop of consolation
-----------
I have feelings and hurt does not think
Who run rumors that your heart gives
When will you understand?
I gave all of one small thing I asked
An opportunity to give is what I dreamed at night
I'll give you my whole life
-----------
I did not know what you were thinking
That maybe it's a little over
And now I'm absorbed
Every word reminds me
And walks with longing and prays all week
You're missing me
-----------
There was no chance for either of us
When will you understand this is over when you will understand it is over
Can no longer be afraid
I do not mind being isolated
I tell you I'm already somewhere else
I do not want you to stay
-----------
When you part with your heart, a war breaks out
And all night without you I suffer every day
I fell to your feet and it's a little hard to breathe now
Turn off lights and one city to get used to
And a fire is burning from a candle wrapped in a ribbon and a repeating prayer
I pray you to you and to you
-----------
How did we pray this day?
You're dressed in white
You appear to me with small steps to me
The moment has come
After all, you are my wife
And I swear to you
-----------
You may have entered my life by mistake
But from that day I woke up
With you I will have children for you I said
When the eyes met, I already knew
The beats of my heart must have been heard in the moon
boom Boom...
-----------
I leave you little to keep
More of me
The truth that left me wanting more
When you touch the sky I have a fear of heights
I love the world because of you
Me and you in God's sandbox
-----------
You tried to be with someone else.
You told me that not everything works,
And sometimes you think of me.
I used to be wrong now.
Once I came back now and come back.
How much I miss your smell, man.
-----------
There were days when you shouted that you love
So how today everything is different, no longer comes back
Time passes away
Maybe it's my fault that you love him
If you come back I'll give it all Just forgive
I need you with me
-----------
Freaky's photography will not help you anything
You're in a dead end movie
Everyone is following you
Only I fly with you
And never stops loving twenty-four,
Hours a day
-----------
Oh-oh, you and I will change the method, we will not be another headline
Oh-oh, me and you, it's me and you, it's me and you oh
I mean living
No labels, no discrimination
That's what's good for me, that's what's good
Let's show them how to love
-----------
I wanted to say thank you
I wanted to say love
I wanted to say I loved you
You know I'm happy
Dream together tomorrow
We want to stay with you always together
-----------
love song
For you
4 letters of love
Three clarifications of one love
Two love mummies
One heart, one.
-----------
Let them have their heads in their ass
We will not stop dancing the Supergroup together
Fire inside me (Naor Urmia)
So let me pick up
Because it makes me feel good to see them singing
Let them in
-----------
here it comes
it's gonna be so
Here is a reason reason
So good
for love.
it's gonna be so
-----------
And sometimes I
Hate you for coming
And why my life, my heart goes in
I miss
nostalgic
and you?
-----------
All of whom will dance to me and you will play all night the songs my love songs
And how is it that you are so beautiful to me? You will understand that it was not my thing that you suddenly came to me, suddenly love
By the time you come I no longer have air. Whatever happens with you will not stop singing
So let's fall just among the stars and ask for a wish
All of whom will dance to me and you will play all night the songs my love songs
And how is it that you are so beautiful to me? You will understand that it was not my thing that you suddenly came to me, suddenly love
-----------
I always take my heart
Your heart forgets everything
And how everything turned normal in you
How does your conscience fall asleep when I feel bad?
Sometimes I get a little crazy
After all, miss you ...
-----------
I won from my mother
Everything you've always done is for me
How you always made sure I had everything
Always get up and do not fall
Oh brother from my mother
From his mother
-----------
We talked a little, you cry again
This is not what will bring you back to me
We were already mad
I have the same bed with her
I'm crowded here, in a mess
Being three is not normal
-----------
My life packs and suitcases can not wait
I bought us one way ticket that you only dream about Mexico
Let's get out of here
Nectar tequila in Acapulco
Belly back in Mexico
Let's get out of here
-----------
I'd love you to be happy
All this is for the best
Because love does not always survive
Even if everything is different now
I'd love you to be happy
Happy even without me
-----------
When I remember your eyes
When I remember your lips
where are you today
I can only dream
And how my life went without you
Now I remember your eyes
-----------
How bad it costs me
I'll tell you, my love
There's room for both of us
And all that happened was just because of us
I and this love of a lifetime
It's enough to be friends today
-----------
It's just around the corner
Neither of us is alone anymore
But sometimes your heart is thirsty for you
Give me your hand
How I have a shadow of memory
About love from high school
-----------
You're everything
Go keep smiling
But Mama tell me
Because why are you so sad
Come sit here beside me
Be close to me
-----------
There is no time for this rattle or friends or KASH
I take the two of them, the whole boat I am from
I did not have a bad-tempered gesture to give me half a consolation
Your life is honey If you are ejected open a table for all the jamaah
You grew up with me from below, so what's mine
Maybe you left the neighborhood but the neighborhood will not leave you
-----------
Without saying a word
And the silence is beautiful here how quiet is beautiful here
Without saying a word it is written in your eyes
Without saying a word
You have left your heart here
You left here
-----------
in the old City.
And in caves in the rock
Thousands of suns shine
We will return to the Dead Sea
On the way to Jericho.
Jerusalem of Gold...
-----------
Another night without you
Suffering from your tears
The sadness in your eyes
You're my love
Do not be sad
Let us burn the flame again
-----------
Let me know
I'm writing you the last song
The red coat I bought you then
Still dropping waiting for you
It's just a nice day to meet again
And without wanting to remember you
-----------
It's hot outside and I'm alone in the opposite
Preparing the coffee with salt does not know what is happening to you
Oy oy oy oy
What will happen to me when you come?
If she only knew what was going on in my heart
The nights, the days, if she only remembered me
-----------
He could not wait
Waiting for the weekend wants you to be
I waited for you not calling
I 'm here in the movie
I waited and waited and ended this week
Tell me why you do not answer
-----------
I love you deeply
How many months s weeks how do not you tell her
Just three words what could be you realize is doing to her
Right you are afraid like an idiot so pull out feelings
Maybe you'll be a bit romantic
Stop quarreling with yourself and that same meaning will begin to be a little sympathetic
-----------
How I was wrong when I was fake
Love
I have not laughed for years
Approaching and moving away
What will happen at the end
No one knows
-----------
Do not turn off the light and go home again
The door says, "We live here in a good time."
Always where I go to you will come back
Wait for me a little Do not turn off the light
Coming back home I'm back by you
I'm on your side again I will not go
-----------
You'll laugh and seduce me
It makes me happy
This is the world and we are also stations of spirit
Trying to fight for nothing
Everyone runs too fast not talking about love
Everyone is running fast and no longer talking about love
-----------
And only with her will I find the medicine
Yes I know, they tell me everything
This impedance is for the better but the head
Shelly is already bursting to think about her
Why tell me why it's so hard
And how much I'll keep waiting
