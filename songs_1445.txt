Closer
Ne-Yo
----------------
Closer  
Closer  
Closer  
Closer  
  
Turn the lights off in this place  
And she shines just like a star  
And I swear I know her face  
I just don't know who you are  
Turn the music up in here  
I still hear her loud and clear  
Like she's right there in my ear  
Telling me  
That she wants to own me  
To control me  
Come closer  
Come closer  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I just can't pull myself away  
Under her spell I can't break  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
And I just can't break myself no way  
But I don't want to escape  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
  
I can feel her on my skin  
I can taste her on my tongue  
She's the sweetest taste of sin  
The more I get the more I want  
She wants to own me  
Come closer  
She says "come closer"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x7]  
(Come closer)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I just can't stop no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I just can't pull myself away  
Under her spell I can't break  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
Come closer

Baby, It's Cold Outside
Rod Stewart
----------------
I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry  
well Maybe just one little kiss more - Put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
C'mon baby  
  
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious  
Well maybe just one little kiss more - Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home - You'll freeze to the bone out there  
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay - Get over that old out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr its cold  
It's cold out there  
Cant you stay awhile longer baby  
Well I really shouldn't alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ahh, do that again

Life Is A Fantasy
Vanilla Ice
----------------
Oh yea...In my dreams I envision myself at the ocean  
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion  
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube  
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube  
Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body  
Flowni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie  
See, I want to get loose with you, is that all right?  
Girl, I want to' do it outside, under the moonlight  
And get on down so we can make that love  
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove  
This is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy...Yea..  
Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine  
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine  
Oh yeah, you like it like that  
You like it like I do and that's where it's at  
So later on that night as we got in my car  
It started up again we didn't get very far  
You made it very clear that you were not in fear  
Leaned over to me and started kissin' my ear  
Oh girl, you feel so good  
You couldn't wait to get home and I understood  
As we got busy, then I pulled up in the driveway  
You said follow me 'cause we're gonna do it my way  
Walked in the front door you startin' strippin' clothes  
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose  
Closer and closer, hot anticipation  
You walked into the closet, came out in some lace and  
I almost lost my mind, but I kept it in tact  
The lace you was wearin' ohhh, I got an attack  
'Cause this is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
Come on baby and let me be your toy  
I'll let you do as you wish just to give you joy  
And get down, I know you want to' get loose  
Let's do it like a train and I'll be the caboose  
Or better yet, I'll take you higher, I think that it's time  
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine  
As we start pumpin', sweat pour down my chest  
And that's when you know Vanilla Ice is the best  
You say ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah  
I don't know what it means but I like it a lot  
This is your fantasy, your highest dream  
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
Yea...Life is just a fantasy  
O yea...Life is just a fantasy...Oh girl...

Dirt Road Blues
Bob Dylan
----------------
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide  
Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
Well, I been praying for salvation  
Laying round in a one-room country shack  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
'Til there's nothing left to see  
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed  
But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above  
looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above  
Rolling through the rain and hail  
Looking for the sunny side of love  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name

Down The Road
Bee Gees
----------------
1974  
I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone.  
Take it nice and easy mama , chicken on the run and I don't care.  
I'd show my body anywhere.  
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere.  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display.  
Don't you think that I don't know  
it ain't been a perfect day , but I don't care.  
I'd sell my body anywhere.  
In the name of creation , I can't find an explanation anywhere.  
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree.  
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care.  
I'd show my feelings anywhere.  
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Down, down the road , up the road (sing 5 times)

Hallucinations
Tim Buckley
----------------
I saw you walking  
Only yesterday  
When I ran to catch you  
You disappeared  
And the street was gray  
  
The candle died  
Now you are gone  
For the flame was too bright  
Now you are gone  
  
I heard you laughing  
With your laugh of gold  
When I called out to you  
Silence returned  
And the air was cold  
  
The castle fell  
Now you are gone  
  
No more rings the bell  
Now you are gone  
I found a letter  
On the day it rained  
When I tore it open  
There in my hands  
Only ash remained  
  
The castle fell  
Now you are gone  
No more rings the bell  
Now you are gone  
  
I felt you breathing  
As I fell asleep  
When I reached out to touch you  
No one was there  
And the night was deep  
  
The candle died  
Now you are gone  
For the flame was too bright  
Now you are gone  
  
I saw you walking  
Only yesterday  
When I ran to catch you  
You disappeared  
And the street was gray  
  
The castle fell  
Now you are gone  
No more rings the bell  
Now you are gone

Loss Of Control
Green Day
----------------
I'm taking down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless  
A bunch of shit talking drama queens and they're all filled with excuses  
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion  
I'd rather go to a funeral than to this high school reunion  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But now you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime  
But you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time 'cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control  
  
Hanging out all by myself, at least I make good company  
Hey, isn't that a whatshisface that I see walking down the street  
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say  
We never had anything in common and I never liked you anyway  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But when you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch  
And you're a stupid mother fucker serve your shit to the pigs cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But now you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime  
But you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time 'cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
We're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control

Life O'riley
NOFX
----------------
I sit in my easy chair  
I've got so much time to spare  
Because I know in the future day  
I'll have my lion's share  
There's nothing that I like better  
Than getting something for nothing  
Some will tell you that nothing's for free  
Obviously they've not met me  
I live the lifestyle they speak of so highly  
I live the life, the life O'Riley  
You can have your cake and eat it too  
And there's lots of free lunch for you  
You think you're being cheated, you don't have a clue  
You don't know what to do  
I sit in my easy chair  
I've got so much time to spare  
Because I know in the future day  
I'll have my lion's share  
I live the lifestyle they speak of so highly  
I live the life, the life O'Riley  
Jump in, jump in

All Men Play On 10
Manowar
----------------
I made a rock' n 'roll sin  
When I tried givin' in to  
make money had to turn down low.  
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud,  
be like us and get a sound that's real thin.  
Wear a polyester suit, act happy look cute,  
get a haircut and buy small gear"  
That's when I turned to them and said,  
"hold it, right there!"  
  
Well it's more to me than just a job,  
and while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.  
Nobody tells a man how to play,  
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,  
Can you hear me say  
  
All men play on ten,  
never gonna turn down again.  
All men play on ten,  
never gonna turn down.  
  
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220  
Step back and let my fingers fly  
While I'm burning up my gear  
There's a fire in your ear  
That won't stop until the day you die.  
  
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar  
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream  
Then I run back to the power rack  
and deck all of my gear.  
  
Well it's more to me than just a job,  
and while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.  
Nobody tells a man how to play,  
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,  
can you hear me say

I Will Be Here For You
Michael W. Smith
----------------
When you feel the sunlight  
Fade into the cold night  
Don't know where to turn  
I don't know where to turn  
And all the dreams you're dreaming  
Seem to lose their meaning  
Let me in your world  
Baby, let me in your world  
All you need is someone you can hold  
Don't be sad, you're not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
I will be here for you  
Somewhere in the night  
Somewhere in the night  
I'll shine a light for you  
Somewhere in the night  
I'll be standing by  
I will be here for you  
  
In this world of strangers  
Of cold and friendly faces  
Someone you can trust  
Oh there's someone you can trust  
I will be your shelter  
I'll give you my shoulder  
Just reach out for my love  
Reach out for my love  
Call my name and my heart will hear  
I will be there, there's nothing to fear  
  
[Chorus]

[Liam]  
You're insecure, so half of four,  
Your old brains are not what they were before,  
[Zayn]  
Add two threes, it's fine for us,  
'Cause we're young and we can still remember stuff  
  
[Harry]  
Everyone else can multiply by 60,  
Everyone else can add two  
  
[All]  
And Now take off one hundred and add on 24,  
Then divide by two and add on seven more  
And if you're struggling now it's not hard to tell  
You don't know, (o oh) your maths skills are terrible  
  
[All]  
If only you had a mind like me  
You'd understand how to divide the sum by three,  
And then just add on the age of this OAP  
You don't know, (o oh) your maths skills are terrible (o oh)

It's really kinda pitiful

So High
John Legend
----------------
Baby since the day you came into my life  
You made me realize that we were born to fly  
You showed me everyday new possibilities  
You proved my fantasies of love could really be  
  
Let's go to a place only lovers go  
To a spot that we've never known  
To the top of the clouds we're floating away yeah  
Ooh this feels so crazy  
Oh this love is blazing  
Baby we're so high  
Walking on cloud nine  
  
(You've got me up so high) So high  
(My shoes are scraping the sky) So high  
(You've got me up so high) Oh  
(My shoes are scraping the sky)  
  
Maybe later we can go up to the moon  
Or sail among the stars before the night is through  
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far  
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are  
  
We'll go to a place only lovers go  
To a spot that we've never known  
To the top of the clouds we're floating away yeah  
Ooh this feels so crazy  
Oh this love is blazing  
Baby we're so high  
Walking on cloud nine  
  
(You've got me up so high) So high  
(My shoes are scraping the sky) So high  
(You've got me up so high) Oh  
(My shoes are scraping the sky)  
  
Ooh yeah  
Ooh oh hey  
  
Ooh this feels so crazy  
Oh this love is blazin'  
Baby we're so high  
Walking on cloud nine  
You got me up so high

You got me up so high  
My shoes are scraping the sky  
  
You got me up so high  
You got me up so high  
You got me up so high  
My shoes are scraping the sky ooh ooh

In the beginning, there was God  
He made the earth, and the heavens  
He gave us light to rule the day  
And another light to rule the night  
  
The Lord, thy God  
Made, He made the seas  
He made the fruit upon the trees  
When He saw, when He saw that it was good  
  
He made a man, made a man  
Only He could, only He could  
God made you  
God made me too  
He made us all  
Made us all equally  
  
Now you say  
God made you  
God made me

Who screamed?  
Was it you?

View From A Hill
Roxette
----------------
Raging waves sweep this heavy heart.  
Cold is the colour of the dark.  
Find a byway and climb that hill,  
Watch the thunder cast a spell.  
What did you gain from love?  
Don't ask me!  
All for the sweetest thrill...  
  
I see a view from a hill - oh oh.  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill  
Oh oh, view from a hill, and it's only a moment away.  
  
Love is a rainfall, hard on the head,  
No escape though you're soaking wet.  
Leave me blinded by your light.  
Leave me stranded alone tonight.  
What did you gain from love?  
Don't ask me!  
All for the cheapest thrill...  
  
I see a view from a hill -- oh oh.  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill -- oh oh,  
View from a hill, and it's only a motion away.

Prologue
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
So my sister and I left Louisiana  
Where the moon on the Mississippi is a-shining ever,  
Like you always hear in the songs of Dixie.  
We look forward to our home-coming?  
And the sooner the better.  
  
Anna II  
  
And the sooner the better!  
  
Anna I  
  
It's a month already since we started  
For the great big cities where you go to make money.  
In seven years our fortune will be made  
And then we can go back.  
  
Anna II  
  
In six years would be much nicer.  
  
Anna I  
  
Our mom and dad and both our brothers wait in old Louisiana  
And we'll send them all our money as we make it,  
For all the money's got to go to build a little house  
Down by the Mississippi in Louisiana.  
Right, Anna ?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.  
  
Anna I  
  
She's the one with the looks, I'm realistic,  
She's just a little mad, my head is on straight.  
But we're really one divided being  
Even though you see two of us  
And both of us are Anna,  
Together we've but a single past, a single future,  
One heart and one savings account,  
And we only do what's best for one another.  
Right, Anna?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.

Hide And Go Seek
Eddie Cochran
----------------
Oh baby let's play some hide and go seek  
Seen an alligator go jumpin' in the river  
Singin' a song about five, ten, fifteen, twenty  
Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, fourty, fourty-five  
Fifty, fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five  
Eighty, eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, a hundred  
I ain't gonna count but one more time  
And that's gonna be when the sun goes down  
I say last night and the night before  
Twenty-four hours knock in' on the door  
I ran upstairs to get my gun  
And when I got back the robbers had run  
Didn't go east, didn't go west  
They must have run back to the robbers' nest  
Oh, I'm gonna catch you this time honey  
  
I ain't gonna count but one more time  
I'm gonna get you sweetie pie  
I'm gonna catch you, yes I'll do  
Please don't let me search for you  
I say last night and the night before  
Twenty-four hours knockin' on the door  
I ran upstairs to get my gun  
And when I got back the robbers had run  
Didn't go east, didn't go west  
They must have run back to the robbers' nest

Tell Me When
Human League
----------------
Tell me when, tell me when.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when.  
Kelly took a lifetime searching for the bottom line.  
I wasn't in to searching 'cause I was doing fine.  
I wasn't into fighting, chasing, sweating, slaving, fretting, lacing.  
Any waste of effort wasn't part of my design.  
Billy was an inspiration, positive and kind,  
until he let confusion overcome his youthful mind.  
Common sense dictated I could never be so blind and then,  
then I see you.  
  
Tell me when, tell me when.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when.  
Happenstance and episode unplanned to load in time.  
Coincidence, the second chance resounding like a rhyme.  
Our paths may cross against the odds to wreck the plans you made,  
among the crowd, a face that smiles to melt your masquerade.  
"If only I could see you," says a stranger deep inside and lets you know that  
when you were so sure you really lied.  
"If only I could see you," says the voice within your brain  
and quietly, insistently it says it once again.  
And then I really need to know.  
  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when.  
If wouldn't seem so lonely, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you. (If only, if only.)  
Baby, you could be free, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you. (If only, if only.)  
You'll never have to doubt me, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you. (If only, if only.)  
Baby, you could free me, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you.  
If only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could. . .  
  
If only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could. . .  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.

I Used To Be Color Blind
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
Strange  
How a dreary world can suddenly change  
To a world as bright as the evening star  
Queer  
What a difference when your vision is clear  
And you see things as they really are  
  
I used to be color-blind  
But I met you and now I find  
There's green in the grass  
There's gold in the moon  
There's blue in the skies  
  
That semi-circle that was always hanging about  
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me it's really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies  
  
I never knew there were such lovely colors  
And the big surprise  
Is the red in your cheeks  
The gold in your hair  
The blue in your eyes

Don't Take Me Down
Wilson Phillips
----------------
'I love you girl' that's what you used to say  
And that no one would ever take it away  
I gave you all I had inside, baby it's alright  
But then you took the love right from my heart  
It's funny a thing so strong can fall apart  
I gave you all I had inside, baby it's alright, ooh  
One day you'll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that you'll change when you never do?  
I've always found a reason to let it slide, baby not this time.  
Ooh, because I know where you're going from here (Don't take me down with you)  
  
Don't take me down (take me down with you)  
'Cause I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)  
And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
You had someone, you had me to love.  
  
Why do we put up all these fronts?  
There's something about the way that you loved me once.  
And why, why is it wrong to want it back again?  
Oh no, one day you'll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that you'' change when you never do?  
I've always found a reason to let it slide, baby not this time.  
Ooh, because I know where you're going from here (Don't take me down with you)  
  
Don't take me down (take me down with you)  
'Cause I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)  
And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
You had someone, you had me to love.  
  
Too many times, I've realized the truth (don't take me down, don't take me  
down) Too many times  
I've seen enough, I've seen it enough to know  
This time you're not, you're not gonna take me down  
Down, down, down, down yeah  
  
Don't take me down (take me down with you)  
'Cause I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)  
And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
You had someone, you had me to love.

Tonight Is Forever
Pet Shop Boys
----------------
I may be wrong, I may be right  
Money's short and time is tight  
Don't even think about those bills  
Don't pay the price, we never will  
We're out again another night  
I never have enough  
It will be like this forever  
If we fall in love  
  
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree  
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key  
  
I may be wrong, I may be right  
So don't depend, I could lie  
I haven't got a job to pay  
But I could stay in bed all day  
Then out again another night  
I never have enough  
It will be like this forever  
If we fall in love  
  
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree  
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight is the first night  
  
We don't need any more when we dance  
I don't think of the future tonight  
  
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree  
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key  
  
I may be wrong, I may be right  
But I don't give up any night  
You could say conventional  
And I could claim intentional  
We're out again another night  
We never have enough  
It will be like this forever  
When we fall in love  
  
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree  
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key  
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree  
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key  
  
Tonight

Barbara Joy
George Jones
----------------
Will you be there in the courtyard for the joy  
Will your honor be avenged with justice done  
When they cover my head over for the joy  
Will you hide your face in shame for what you've done?  
  
You were alway wild and reckless, Barbara dear  
But I worshiped you, my love was like a fire  
And your wedding was the high spot of the whole year  
But your marriage left so much to be desired.  
  
Saying that you are were willing Barbara Joy  
The face you're showing gives away your sin  
All your hopes of money can't retore your pride  
Maybe you were willin', don't let me die.  
  
When the phone rang in the middle of the night  
Your tender voice was shaking with alarm  
So without a thought I hurried to your side  
Always seeking to protect you from all harm.  
  
You threw your arms around me, it was like a dream  
And what we knew was bound to happen, did  
Then the doorway framed your husband and I heard you scream  
Unless you speak tomorrow I'll be dead.  
  
Saying that you are were willing Barbara Joy  
The face you're showing gives away your sin  
All your hopes of money can't retore your pride  
Maybe you were willin', don't let me die.

Marriage Is For Old Folks
Nina Simone
----------------
I love dancing  
Crazy romancing  
Fellas advancing constantly  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Old folks, not for me!  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life!  
  
I love singing  
Good healthy clinging  
Quietly bringing on a spree  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks!  
One married he  
One married she  
Whaddya got?  
Two people watchin' tv!  
  
I'm not ready  
To quit bein' free  
And I'm not willing  
To stop being me  
I've gotta sing my song  
Why should I belong  
To some guy who says  
That I'm wrong?  
  
Doo doo dooo  
De doo de doo  
De-doo de-doo  
Doo doo doo  
Dooo  
  
Cookin' dinner  
Lookin' no thinner  
Gray elbows and  
A sudsy sea  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks,  
And it's not for me!  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life!  
  
I'm exploding  
With youth and with zest  
Who needs corroding  
In some vulture's nest?  
I've gotta fly my wings  
Go places, do things  
My freedom bell's really  
Gonna ring!  
  
Doo doo dooo....(etc.)  
  
I've been through years  
Too many blue years  
Now I want New Year's every eve  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
Not for me  
Can't you see  
Marriage ain't for me

I Wish I Wasn't
Jennifer Lopez
----------------
First Verse  
I'm home alone again  
And you're out, hanging with your friends  
So you say, but I know it's not quite that way  
It's getting pretty late and you haven't checked on me all day  
When I called you didn't answer  
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me, tight in your arms  
And I wish, I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So you couldn't hurt me  
It just ain't fair the way you treat me  
No you don't deserve me  
Wasted my time thinking about you and you ain't never gone change  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So I wouldn't feel this way  
  
Verse 2  
When you touch me my heart melts  
And everything you did wrong I forgive  
So you play me and take advantage  
Of the love that I feel for you  
Why you wanna hurt me so bad  
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad  
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and its hard for me to even look at you  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me tight in your arms ooh baby  
I wish I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Bridge  
Said you care about me, but from what I see  
I ain't feeling that, so I disagree  
Gave you all my love and understanding and you treated me like your enemy  
So leave me alone, don't want nothing from you  
Just go back where you came from this house is no longer your home  
You you are not welcome no more  
  
Chorus (repeat 2x)  
  
Outro  
I hear you knocking at my door again  
I'm wondering should I let you in  
I open up the door and see the flowers for me  
So beautiful in your hands  
You start begging me to take you back,  
I've always been a sucker for romance  
And before you know it I can see, you're all over me  
Oh no here I go again  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you so you couldn't hurt me

The Willies
Eddie Cochran
----------------
Everytime, we get together  
Everytime, your lips meet mine  
I start a-shiverin' and a-shakin'  
A quiverin' and a-quakin'  
Ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
Everytime, I look at you  
You don't know, what I go through  
Well, my head starts reelin'  
With a crazy kind of feelin'  
'Cause ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
When we kiss, that's the best of all  
I'm outta my mind, I'm havin' a ball  
I want this feelin' to stay and stay  
So I hold you tight while I push you away  
  
Don't you know, what you do to me  
I'm afraid that you just won't see  
But I'm laughin' and cryin', you got me sighin'  
Ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
Yeah everytime, we get together  
Yeah everytime, your lips meet mine  
I start a-shiverin' and a-shakin'  
A quiverin' and a-quakin'  
Ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
When we kiss, that's the best of all  
I'm outta my mind, 'cause I'm havin' a ball  
I want this feelin' to stay and stay  
So I hold you tight while I push you away  
  
Don't you know, what you do to me  
I'm afraid that you just won't see  
But I'm laughin' and cryin', you got me sighin'  
Wow, ooh yeah, you give me the willies

Money flowin like a wet pussy, that's a long river  
So you got your bitch on lock, I'll slim jim her

Better Off Dead
Elton John
----------------
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on  
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning  
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light  
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight  
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse  
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news  
  
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches  
They always could find us but they never could catch us  
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe  
We watched the arrested get taken away  
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat  
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street  
  
Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire  
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired  
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side  
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died

UB40 - Sparkle Of My Eyes  
Many a girl has caught my eye, Verse 1  
Many a girl and that ain't no lie.  
But girl to me, you top them all,  
So beautiful with no effort at all.  
Sparkle of my eyes, sparkle of my eyes, Chorus  
Sparkle of my eyes, sparkle of my eyes.  
Girl in you eyes I see the stars, Verse 2  
Warm as the sun, in spring you are,  
A certain delight I feel in your touch,  
And when you smile I love it so much.  
Sparkle of my eyes, sparkle of my eyes, Chorus  
Sparkle of my eyes, sparkle of my eyes.  
(Middle 8)  
Gentle to me and so very kind, Verse 3  
Never saying no, you're good for my mind.  
You ask me why your so special to me,  
Look in these eyes girl, and then you will see.  
(Repeat Chorus)

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad  
My father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad  
Then one day I learned a word that saved my achin' nose  
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
I've traveled all around the world and everywhere I went  
I'd use my word and all would say, "There goes a clever gent"  
But when Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me  
I say my special word and then they ask me out to tea  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay  
Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say  
But better use it carefully or it can change your life  
One night I said it to my girl and now my girl's my wife  
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Dirty Work
Steely Dan
----------------
Times are hard  
You're afraid to pay the fee  
So you find yourself somebody  
Who can do the job for free  
When you need a bit of lovin'  
Cause your man is out of town  
That's the time you get me runnin'  
And you know I'll be around  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
I don't want to do your dirty work  
No more  
I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
  
Light the candle  
Put the lock upon the door  
You have sent the maid home early  
Like a thousand times before  
Like the castle in its corner  
In a medieval game  
I foresee terrible trouble  
And I stay here just the same  
  
[Chorus]

Morrissey
----------------
We're really missing you  
We're really missing you  
Oh, and you've only just gone  
  
Oh, well, you punched and fell  
Then you felt embarrassed  
My heart goes out to you  
So I offered love  
And it was not required  
Oh, what else can I do?  
What else can I do?  
  
We're really missing you  
We're really missing you  
And you've only just gone  
  
So, Sunny, send at least one thoughtful letter  
My heart goes out to you  
Tell us all how things are so much better  
My heart, it left with you  
What else can I do?  
  
Oh, they're not forgiving you  
And you're not even wrong  
  
Oh, with your jean belt wrapped around your arm  
Oh, Sunny, my heart goes out to you  
And with a needle pressed onto tight skin  
Sunny, I cry when I see where it's taken you  
  
Aah...  
I'm here, I won't move  
Aah...  
I'm here, I won't move  
Aah...  
I'm here, I will not move  
Aah...

Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Louis Armstrong
----------------
Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Though I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless why stir up memories?  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for?  
Awf'lly diff'rent without you  
Don't get around much anymore

My Life
Oingo Boingo
----------------
I would really like to know you better  
But sometimes I'm afraid that it's not meant to be  
I would like to believe in something higher  
But I can't get a grip on all the little things  
  
When the night comes I cannot sit still you see  
And the years they have not been so kind to me  
Got a gallery of figures standing all in a row  
And every single figure has a soul of its own  
But I never look back  
Never look back  
Don't turn your back on me  
  
(Chorus)  
(Hey yeah) My life has come unraveled again  
Like so many threads  
(Hey yeah) my life has begun unfolding  
In so many pieces  
(Hey yeah) my life has come unraveled again like  
So many threads in the wind - drift away - drift away  
  
There's a time and a place  
For understanding  
And a time when action speaks louder than words  
And I don't seem to get no indications  
And I don't know how to get through to you  
And when time like the pyramids  
Has worn away  
All the mountains and the valleys  
Of the words that we say  
  
We have got to make sure that something remains  
If we lose each other we've got no one to blame  
So never look back  
Never look back  
Don't turn your back on me  
  
(Chorus)

Without You
Linkin Park
----------------
I know that its over I hate when its over,  
The more I think about you the more I want to call  
(I think I'll call)  
  
Now that you see me can you belive me,  
Why do you look so scared,  
(please don't cry)  
  
I don't know if I can live without you  
(what is left of me without you)  
  
I don't know if I am free without you  
(how can I obsess without you!)  
  
The more I think of you the more it intenceifies my heart,  
Hideing in a sea of lies,  
Once I swore I die for you now I'm not so sure,  
(I don't think you are real enymore)  
  
I can't change you,  
(you can't change me)  
  
Now we'are through  
  
I don't if can live without you  
(what is left of me without you)  
  
I don't know if I am free without you  
(how can I obsess without you)  
  
She's gone, what is left of me without you (how can I obsess without you)  
She's gone, what is left of me without you (how can I obsess without you)  
She's gone, what is left of me without you (how can I obsess without you)  
  
She's gone!!!!! (without you)

2000 Blues
ZZ Top
----------------
A hundred thousand dollars  
Wouldn't touch the price I paid  
Of the hundred thousand moments  
Of the times I wish I'd stayed.  
But even if I had all the time and money,  
It's still the same old news.  
Nothin' does you any good  
When you got 2000 blues.  
  
Ten thousand clouds  
On a rainy rainy day  
Couldn't wash away  
All the dust and the haze.  
But I tried and I tried  
To search for all the clues,  
Why I can't wash away  
These 2000 blues.  
  
If I had an airplane  
With a co-pilot too,  
I'd fly to a planet  
That was closest to you.  
I'd set the tracking system  
With your safety fuse,  
And set the countdown  
For 2000 blues.

Boulevard Of Broken Dreams
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
I walk along the street of sorrow  
The boulevard of broken dreams  
Where gigolo and gigolette  
Can take a kiss without regret  
So they forget their broken dreams.  
  
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow  
When you behold your shattered schemes.  
And gigolo and gigolette  
Wake up to find their eyes are wet  
With tears that tell of broken dreams.  
  
Here is where you'll always find me,  
Always walking up and down,  
But I left my soul behind me  
In an old cathedral town.  
  
The joy that you find here, you borrow,  
You cannot keep it long it seems.  
But gigolo and gigolette  
Still sing a song and dance along  
The boulevard of broken dreams.  
  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da,  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da,  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  
  
The joy that you find here, you borrow,  
You cannot keep it long it seems.  
But gigolo and gigolette  
Still sing a song and dance along  
The boulevard of broken dreams.

London's Burning
Clash
----------------
London's burning! London's burning!  
  
All across the town, all across the night  
Everybody's driving with full headlights  
Black or white turn it on, face the new religion  
Everybody's sitting 'round watching television!  
  
London's burning with boredom now  
London's burning dial 99999  
  
I'm up and down the Westway, in an' out the lights  
What a great traffic system - it's so bright  
I can't think of a better way to spend the night  
Then speeding around underneath the yellow lights  
  
London's burning with boredom now  
London's burning dial 99999  
  
Now I'm in the subway and I'm looking for the flat  
This one leads to this block, this one leads to that  
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home  
I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone  
  
London's burning with boredom now...  
London's burning dial 99999

Tele He's Not Talking
Ocean Colour Scene
----------------
Tele He's Not Talking  
Tele he's the one he knows what to say  
Knows how to find his own way  
He knows the roads by night and by doorways  
But watching the light in a hall  
Won't change a thing or say at all  
What it is that he says  
  
Still he says that I don't know  
Still he says that I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't why I think about so much  
When I don't know what it is I can't say  
And I wouldn't change a thing if I believe you all  
And scream it in your face  
  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
  
Tele deals the cards and draws an ace  
And finds himself miles away  
Where skies ain't bruised by towers and fumes  
Children ain't too young to play  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all  
But we're born different days  
  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all when I'm miles away  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all but we were born on different days  
  
I'd change a thing  
I'd change it all when I'm miles away...

Everytime
Michael Bolton
----------------
Don't want to lose this feelin'  
It's more than I need to survive  
Just when I stopped believin'  
That's when you came into my life  
  
You turned it around  
Within you I found  
Everything that's real to me  
I'm lost inside your love  
And that's just where I want to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time you give your love, it's a fire, it's a miracle  
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle  
You've got the power, you know it  
To touch my every fantasy  
When we make love, you show it  
In everything you give me  
  
So take what you want, take what you will  
You're the one who holds the key  
To open up the door, to reach the deepest part of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time you give your love, it's a fire  
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle  
Every time, every time  
  
Just when I stopped believin', girl, you stepped into my life  
You give me the fire I needed  
It was so hard to find, you're givin' it every time  
  
[Chorus]

Spanish Harlem
Frankie Valli
----------------
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun  
It only comes out when the moon is on the run  
And all the stars are gleamin'  
  
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete  
But soft and sweet and dreamin'  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul  
And starts a fire there and then I lose control  
I have to beg your pardon  
  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
I'm gonna pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun  
It only comes out when the moon is on the run  
And all the stars are gleamin'  
  
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete  
But soft and sweet and dreamin'  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem

Hum Drum Boogie
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
She surprises me, sometimes she hums on my balls  
And I can see the world right through her bedroom walls  
She has a jaw like a pelican's beak is deep  
Humming me right to sleep, my favortie freak  
I can rearrange the patterns of the stars in the sky  
I can fly with the seagulls on the beach with the tide  
Cause she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air  
If I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now boogie  
That thing, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
I see my life flash before me  
I hear all my favortie song at one time  
(when she blow me) right before I actually go blind  
I'm running back and forth though the door of (in and out of) my mind  
(when she blow me) my favortie freak is so fine  
To have her hum in performance, the show is enormous  
Only two fans in attendance, these two in my pants  
(my balls) she's my favortie, she's got my standing applause  
Humming me into harmony, right through my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boggie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls  
Undo my belt, put down my drawers  
Kiss my dick and hum my balls  
Undo my belt, put down my drawers  
Kiss my dick and hum my balls  
And she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air  
If I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls

In Lonesome Dove
Garth Brooks
----------------
She was a girl on a wagon train  
Haded west across the plains  
The train got lost in a summer storm  
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home  
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain  
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train  
And she looked down and her heart was gone  
The train went west but she stayed on  
In Lonesome Dove  
  
A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand  
A blooming rose in a bed of sand  
She loved the man who wore a star  
A Texas Ranger known near and far  
So they got married and they had a child  
But times were touch and the West was wild  
So it was no surprise the day she learned  
That her Texas man would not return  
To Lonesome Dove  
  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove  
  
She watched her boy grow into a man  
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand  
He wore his star for all to see  
He was a Texas lawman legacy  
The one day word blew into town  
It seemed the men that shot his father down  
Had robbed a bank in Cherico  
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico  
Was Lonesome Dove  
  
The shadows stretched across the land  
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande  
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street  
The men lay at the ranger's feet  
But legend tells to this very day  
That shots were comin' from an alleyway  
Though no one knows who held the gun  
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone  
In Lonesome Dove  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove

Crown Of Thorns
Yngwie Malmsteen
----------------
You've always shared the light.  
Although you could clearly see the sacrifice.  
Preaching wrong from right.  
Prosecution was the story of your life.  
The blood money paid.  
A kiss betrayed.  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
And now the curtain is drawn.  
And I can see the moment of some kind of truth.  
They nailed you to the cross.  
Although you walked the righteous path since your birth.  
The blood money paid.  
A kiss betrayed.  
In this final hour.  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
[guitar solo]  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
To be crucified.  
It was his destiny

It's A Hard World
Supertramp
----------------
I live in a vacumn, no air  
I'm stuck in back room, somewhere  
But it don't bother me amyway 'cause I know  
Goin' to get out soon, I got places to go  
  
There's a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break, someone to believe  
but right now I'm just tryin' to survive  
Livin' rough, shackin' up, hangin' tough, shapin' up  
  
Get the picture, get the scene I paint fo ryou  
Ah, but it's worth it, all the pain I'm goin' through  
Beat the sidewalk, hear the fast talk, everyday  
I don't worry 'cause I know I'm on my way  
  
The view from my window, ain't too good  
Should be some mail for me soon from Hollywood  
When the phone rings, could be big things, anytime  
Operator is there somethin' wrong with this line  
  
Rejections, I've had a few  
Happens to the best, it ain't nothin' new  
Still I keep on swingin' away  
S'gonna be a breakthrough any day  
  
Keep hanging in there, that's my philosophy  
And soon I'll find my big chance, wait and see  
Some make it fast, but they just come and go  
Me, I'm built to last and that's one thing I know  
  
Those straight life people, they don't understand  
Yeah they just want it all laid out and planned  
Me, I'm not like them, I do things my own way  
I know I'm gonna break through any day  
  
Life in the city, can get you down  
There's amillion guys out there all snooping around  
You gotta think you're the best, beat out all the rest  
And fight your way up to the top of the town  
  
There's a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break, someone to believe  
Right now I'm just tryin' to survive  
I'm know I'm gonna get there, dead or alive  
  
I'm going to reach for the moon  
And all the stars too  
I'm gonna get there real soon, I know I will  
I want the universe, and all the planers too

Acoustic Funeral
HIM
----------------
You missed the winter and it followed you back home  
Where sun kissed the crimson footsteps in the melting snow  
We are doing our best to disown the golden mean  
By these acts of cruelty in the name of beauty to be free  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
We're dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
On the verge of a vow to kill all reason locking that door  
To a nightmare within a nightmare we are bound to adore  
Let the pleasure in the shape of a heart lie to me  
And finally confirm all fears to be so real  
Be so real  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
We're dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
Underneath the ice so thin I am turning blue (I'm turning blue)  
The one last thing I know to be real is the shadow of you  
Killing love with a kiss  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
We're dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
(The acoustic funeral for love in limbo)  
We're dancing with tags on our toes  
(We're dancing with tags on our toes)  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
Lest we have to fall  
For the acoustic funeral  
  
Killing love with a kiss

Sleigh Ride In July
Bing Crosby
----------------
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go  
Let's look at the snow  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
(We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land)  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
(There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray)  
(It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day)  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts  
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie  
  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Whoo, whoo there now  
Steady, easy, whoo, everybody out

Au Jardin Des Sans Pourquoi
Josh Groban
----------------
Retournons avant la guerre  
Avant la fin  
Avant le besoin de toutes ces prieres  
Aucun mal  
Aucun bien  
Aucun mot croche  
Ni mots malins que l'on dit quand on n'sait pas  
  
Sous un ciel bleu, ciel sans nuage  
Retournons la-bas  
Sans orage  
Retournons la-bas  
Au jardin des sans pourquoi  
  
Je t'ai vue te promener la-bas  
Sous l'arc-en-ciel  
Brillante comme une etincelle dans la nuit  
Ou je t'ai vue aussi  
Tombant du ciel  
Comme une larme de st laurent, disparaissant  
Dans un ciel blue, ciel sans nuage  
Retournons la-bas  
Sans orage  
Retournons la-bas  
Au jardin des sans pourquoi

Mom
Garth Brooks
----------------
A little baby told God,  
'Hey, I'm kinda scared,  
Don't really know if I wanna go down there,  
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball  
But that's a great big place, and I'm so small.  
  
Why can't I just stay here with you?  
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too? '  
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do,  
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you  
  
So hush now, baby, don't you cry  
Because there's someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure you're always gonna be all right  
A loving angel, tender, tough, and strong  
Come on, child, it's time to meet your mom  
  
Now, when she's talking to you  
Make sure you listen close  
Because she's gonna teach you everything  
You'll ever need to know  
  
Like how to mind your manners  
To love and laugh and dream  
And she'll put you on the path  
That'll bring you back to me  
  
So hush now, little baby, don't you cry  
Because there's someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure you're always gonna be all right  
A loving angel, tender, tough, and strong  
Come on, child, it's time to meet your mom

Larger Than Life
Kiss
----------------
If you want to make believe  
There's nothing up my sleeve  
I'm a man as man can be  
As you can plainly see  
  
Don't want to see no tears  
Eliminate your fears  
When you think you've seen it all, baby  
  
You can't believe your eyes, what you heard weren't lies  
My love is too much to hold, too much to hold  
Much to much  
  
I'm someone you can't fight  
I'm plain in size  
You can't believe your eyes  
What you heard were not lies  
I'm too much to hold  
I can't be bought or sold  
I'm far more than a man  
I'm gonna make you understand  
I'm larger than a life size man  
  
And you can't believe your eyes, what you heard weren't lies  
My love is too much to hold, too much to hold  
  
My love is larger than life, ooh larger than life  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is too much to hold, it can't be sold, oh no  
  
You can't believe your eyes, what you heard weren't lies  
My love is too much to hold, too much to hold  
  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is too much to hold, it can't be sold, oh no  
I'm larger than a life size man  
  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is larger than life, ooh larger than life  
My love is too much to hold, it can't be sold, oh no

Solid Air
John Martyn
----------------
You've been taking your time  
And you've been living on solid air  
You've been walking the line  
And you've been living on solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round inside  
And I can tell you that it's hard to hide  
When you're living on solid air  
And you've been painting the blues  
And you've been looking through solid air  
You've been seeing it through  
And you've been looking through solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round in your mind  
And I can tell you don't like what you find  
When you're moving through solid air, solid air  
I know you, I love you  
And I can be your friend  
I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
You've been stoning it cold  
You've been living on solid air  
You've been finding it cold  
You've been living on solid air  
I don't know what's going on inside  
I can tell you that it's hard to hide  
When you're living on solid air, solid air  
You've been getting too deep  
You've been living on solid air  
You've been missing your sleep  
And you've been moving through solid air  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But I know you don't like what you find  
When you're moving through solid air, solid air  
I know you, I love you  
I will be your friend  
I will follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
You've been walking your line  
You've been walking on solid air  
You've been taking your time  
But you've been walking on solid air  
Don't know what's going on inside  
But I can tell you that it's hard to hide  
When you're living on solid air, solid air  
You've been painting the blues  
You've been living on solid air  
And you've been seeing it through  
And you've been looking through solid air  
I don't know what's going 'round in your mind  
But I can tell you don't like what you find  
When you're living through solid air, solid air  
I know you, I love you  
And I can be your friend  
I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
[Incomprehensible] solid air  
[Incomprehensible] solid air  
Solid air

Roman's Revenge 2
Nicki Minaj
----------------
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin  
So far ahead, these bums is lagging  
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging  
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon  
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon  
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'  
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been  
Yeah, I said it, has-been, hang it up, flatscreen  
Plasma, hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma  
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine  
I got bars, sentencing  
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt  
And I'll kick that ho, punt  
Forced trauma, blunt  
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front  
You need a job, this ain't cutting it  
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fucking with  
You lil' Fraggle Rock, I beat you with a pad-a-lock  
I am a movie, camera block  
You outta work, I know it's tough  
But enough is enough  
  
[Hook]  
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]  
I eat your face off  
You niggas sweet as pie like this is a bake-off  
I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball!  
(Skrr! ) I'll beat your brakes off  
Hi, I'm Tune, salt in the wound  
I'm up in this bitch - pardon the goons!  
Throw dirt on the floor get caught in the broom  
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon  
I got the money and the power, a woman in the shower  
And she don't want nothing but my Johnson - Howard  
Sour Dies in the Swisher Sweet - sweet and sour  
You're scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible  
Ah! I don't know what y'all on - please  
I go in like "goin"  
Drink in my hand with the world in the other  
The Uzi go "brrrr" - stutter  
Life is a puzzle - jigsaw  
All I do is win - my name should be "Victor"  
Haha! Old-ass rappers  
I'm still the shit! Old-ass Pampers  
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin  
I was just dumpin my ashes, I'mma puff it and pass it  
I'm a fuckin assassin, you should jump in the casket!  
  
[Hook]  
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon  
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon  
  
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]  
Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?  
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?  
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho  
Now I'mma wrap your coffin with a bow  
"Nicki, she's just mad cause you took the spot"  
Word, that bitch mad cause I took the spot?  
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot  
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top  
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling  
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking  
Overseas, church, Vatican  
You at a standstill, mannequin  
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?  
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite  
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike  
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite  
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's  
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs  
I call the play, now do you see why?  
These bitches calling me Manning Eli  
Manning Eli, these bitches calling me Manning Eli!

Night And Day
U2
----------------
When the jungle shadows fall  
Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock  
As it's standing against the wall  
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops  
When the summer shower's through  
So a voice within me  
Keeps revealing you, you  
  
Night and day  
You are the one  
Only you beneath the moon  
And under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter, baby, where you are  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Day and night  
Why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic gloom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Though such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Oh, such a hungry yearning  
Burning, burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Night and day  
Night and day  
Night, night, night and day  
Night and day  
Night, night and day  
Night and day

Frozen
Within Temptation
----------------
I can't feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
All colors seem to fade away  
I can't reach my soul  
  
I would stop running  
If I knew there was a chance  
It tears me apart to sacrifice it all  
But I'm forced to let go  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?  
  
I can feel your sorrow  
  
You won't forgive me  
But I know, you'll be alright  
It tears me apart that you will never know  
But I have to let go  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?  
  
Everything will slip away  
Shattered pieces will remain  
When memories fade into emptiness  
Only time will tell it's tale, if it all has been in vain  
  
I can't feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
  
Frozen  
What can I do?  
Frozen  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen, Frozen

Carnival
Our Lady Peace
----------------
You know you're not a strong man  
And you're just about to cry  
Hang on it's all right  
You worry about the future  
The sign said "yoga class for cats"  
It's okay  
The dynamite is waiting  
They bankrupted the sky  
You're frustrated by the cracks in  
The pavement  
And every mother's back  
Once again  
The carnival closed down  
But if this world ever turns around  
You'll be there  
When everyone is sane you'll be there

Eleanor Rigby
Ray Charles
----------------
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been  
Lives in a dream  
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door  
Who is it for?  
  
All the lonely people  
Where do they all come from ?  
All the lonely people  
Where do they all belong ?  
  
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear  
No one comes near.  
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there  
What does he care ?  
  
All the lonely people  
Where do they all come from ?  
All the lonely people  
Where do they all belong ?  
  
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name  
Nobody came  
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave  
No one was saved  
  
All the lonely people  
Where do they all come from ?  
All the lonely peopl  
Where do they all belong

Wonderful Life
Zucchero
----------------
Here I go out to sea again  
The sunshine fills my hair  
And dreams hang in the air  
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes  
You know it feels unfair  
There's magic everywhere  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
The sun in your eyes  
The heat is in your hair  
They seem to hate you  
Because you're there  
I need is friend  
Oh I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not stand here on my own  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
I need a friend  
Oh I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not so alone  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to run and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
Wonderful life  
Wonderful life  
Wonderful life

The Power
Amy Grant
----------------
A king is crying from his throne  
He had a queen but now she's gone  
What is this magic that we seek  
The mighty strong turn mighty weak  
Every good girl hears it  
Every bad boy fears it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
The power touches me  
The power helps us see  
The power holds my hand  
The power drives me crazy  
  
A flower grows, an old man dies  
And through it all we still survive  
A poor man screams but no one hears  
Ain't nothing changed much through the years  
Every bad day needs it  
Every good day breeds it  
No matter how it feels  
When it's real you know it's real  
Stronger than any bomb that any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus)  
And it won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Hey, hey  
Open up your eyes and see  
It won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Every good day needs it  
Every bad day needs it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
Stronger than any bomb any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus twice)  
The power drives me crazy  
If i believe and you believe  
And we believe everything is gonna be all right  
All right  
It just might  
  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)

Country Christmas
George Jones
----------------
In our little country settlement there's harmony a-ringing  
The echo flowing softly through the hills of silent night  
All the shinny decorations on the big tree in the church yard  
Will make the folks for miles around sing I Saw the Light.  
  
We're gonna have a country christmas  
We're gonna Christmas the old time away  
We'll let the church bells ring as we gather 'round to sing  
And show our love for Jesus as we pray.  
  
We'll have lots of homemade candy and presents for the children  
And let the elders grace the table filled with the food and wine  
There's not a better way to say happy birthday Jesus  
Than to have a good old gospel singing country Christmas time.  
  
We're gonna have a country christmas  
We're gonna Christmas the old time away  
We'll let the church bells ring as we gather round to sing  
And show our love for Jesus as we pray.  
  
Jesus as we pray...

Fed Up
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
She was abused he thought it brung amused but it Really brought pain  
The shame being known as the girl with no name it Droved her insane  
The lie's, rumors, and the blame she couldn't no Longer take the rain  
  
She was only 15 she didn't now where her dreams Led she wanted to be a singer  
But didn't know about the pain it might bring her Fed up, fed up ohhh she was
fed up  
  
She thought she was in love with the boy that Brung her down left her everyday  
With a frown black eyes on her way too school but She always kept it cool  
But the tears layed inside questions why pop in Her head late at night while  
Sshe sit on her bed wishing she was dead.  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
Finally got loose left the nam she was abused by 19 and no more crys  
Now she's living her dream seeing the things that She thought she'll never  
See I guess she was fed up by being dumped Punched now it's all over  
Now she's stronger Iam sorry but her name  
Couldn't be mentioned but all  
You need too know was that we were real close  
  
Chorus repeat till end

Silvery Rain
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
Butterflies danced on invisible strings  
Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow  
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  
Never moan, they're happy to be working  
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall

Shadow Dancer
Ufo
----------------
I am back in the circus  
Oh hustling days  
I look at the world  
In a rose coloured haze  
Cramp tight bodies  
Jive and girate  
Bump and grind to the rhythm of fate  
And we spun in the sunlight  
Of our long summers day  
We kissed the heavens now  
It's still a beautiful day  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world  
  
Married a model  
From old Hong Kong  
Came to England  
Just a singing my song  
This love in a letter  
Sure didn't last  
Stamped her passport  
Never saw her arse  
  
And we spun in the sunlight  
Of our long summers day  
We kissed the heavens now  
It's still a beautiful day  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world  
Solo  
Unlucky in life,  
Unlucky in love  
No special blessing from above  
Fools and horses  
Come to my door  
I am the stranger  
Who sleeps on the floor  
  
We spun in the sunlight  
Of our long summers day  
We kissed the heavens now  
It's still a beautiful day  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world

Never Is A Promise
Fiona Apple
----------------
You'll never see  
The courage I know  
Its colors' richness  
Won't appear within your view  
I'll never glow,  
The way that you glow  
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you  
  
But as the scenery grows,  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I understand what I am still to proud to mention  
-to you  
  
You'll say you understand  
But you don't understand  
You'll say you'd never give up  
Seeing eye to eye  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never touch  
These things that I hold  
The skin of my emotions  
Lies beneath my own  
You'll never feel  
The heat of this soul  
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown  
To you  
  
You'll say don't fear your dreams  
It's easier than it seems  
You'll say you'd never let me fall  
From hopes so high  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never live the life that I live  
I'll never live the life  
That wakes me in the night  
You'll never hear the message I give  
You'll say it looks as though I might  
Give up this fight  
  
But as the scenery grows,  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I realize what I am now too smart to mention  
To you  
  
You'll say you understand,  
You'll never understand  
I'll say I'll never wake up  
Knowing how or why  
I don't know what to believe in  
You don't know who I am  
You'll say I need appeasing  
When I start to cry  
But never is a promise  
And I'll never need a lie

If I Can't Change Your Mind
Train
----------------
Tears fill up my eyes  
I'm washed away with sorrow  
And somewhere in my mind  
I know there's no tomorrow  
  
I see that you're leaving soon  
I guess you've had your fill  
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will  
  
And all throughout all the years  
I've never strayed from you my dear  
You suspect I'm somewhere else  
You're feeling sorry for yourself  
  
Leaving with a broken heart  
I love you even still  
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will  
If I can't change your mind  
  
Even though my heart keeps breaking  
Don't you know that I'll be waiting here for you  
I hope you see I'm dedicated  
Look how long that I have waited  
If you come back you will find a different person  
If you change your mind  
  
How can I explain away somethin' I haven't done  
And if you cant trust in me now, you'll never trust in anyone  
With all the crazy doubts you've got  
I love you even still  
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will  
If I can't change your mind  
If I can't change your mind  
Wish I could change your mind

Little Bird
Ed Sheeran
----------------
If we take this bird in, with it's broken leg,  
We can nurse it, she said,  
Come inside for a little lie down with me,  
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worse thing.  
  
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder,  
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?  
And let me hold you, oh.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,  
We can lie down, so I'm next to you,  
Come inside for a little home made tea,  
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me,  
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep,  
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now,  
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love,  
You make me scream, then I made you cry,  
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
You're my little bird.

Before The Lobotomy
Green Day
----------------
Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
Of another place and time  
Where my family's from.  
  
Singing  
I can hear them singing.  
When the rain had washed away  
All these scattered dreams  
  
Dying  
Everyone's reminding  
Hearts are washed in misery  
Drenched in gasoline  
  
Laughter  
There is no more laughter  
Songs of yesterday  
Now live in the underground  
  
Life before the lobotomy  
Christian sang the eulogy  
Sign my love a lost memory  
From the end of the century  
  
Well, it's enough to make you sick  
To cast a stone and throw a brick  
When the sky is falling down  
It burned your dreams into the ground  
  
Christian's lesson is what he's been sold  
We are normal and self-controlled  
Remember to learn to forget  
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes  
  
Well I'm not stoned  
I'm just fucked up  
I got so high I can't stand up  
I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed  
I'm not in love 'cause I'm a mess  
  
Like refugees  
We're lost like refugees  
Like refugees  
We're lost like refugees  
The brutality of reality  
Is the freedom that keeps me from  
  
Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
Of another place and time  
Where my family's from.  
  
Singing  
I can hear them singing.  
When the rain had washed away  
All these scattered dreams  
  
Dying  
Everyone's reminding  
Hearts are washed in misery  
Drenched in gasoline  
  
Laughter  
There is no more laughter  
Songs of yesterday  
Now live in the underground

Please don't let me argue anymore  
I won't make you worry like before  
Can't remember what we fought about  
Late late last night we said it was over  
But i remember when we thought it out  
We both had a broken heart  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
As i drove away i felt a tear  
It hit me i was losing someone dear  
Told my folks i would be alright  
Tossed and i turned, my head was so heavy  
Then i wondered as it got light  
Were you still awake like me?  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Time  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)

Last Christmas
Christmas Songs
----------------
Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh  
Ah-ah  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?  
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  
  
Happy Christmas  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh baby  
  
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice  
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A man under cover, but you tore me apart  
Ooh ooh, now I've found a real love  
You'll never fool me again  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave meaway)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)  
A man under cover, but you tore him apart  
Maybe next year, I'll give it to someone  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Special  
So long

Right On Time
Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
One shot all I need  
I've got rhythm when I bleed  
  
'Til death do us part  
Break my heart so I can start  
  
Supercalifragilistic  
Kiss me in the futuristic  
Twisted but I must insist  
It's time to get on top of this  
  
[Chorus]  
It's right on time  
It's right on time  
It's right on time  
It's right on time it's right on time  
it's right on time it's right on time  
Lookin' fine you're lookin' fine get on 1999  
It's right on time  
  
Discard to bombard  
Calling all you shooting stars  
  
Holy cow bow wow wow  
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now  
  
Joan of Arc reincarnated  
Maybe we could be related  
So much blood to circulate  
And so much space to decorate  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Plain and simple pain  
I want to but I can't complain  
  
Death row let us go  
It's time to blow up for the show  
  
All the world reverberated  
Coming through we motorcaded  
Vibrate when we operated  
Turning up in solid stated  
  
Oh Lord

Love Went Mad
Elvis Costello
----------------
I've looked at it every way I can  
From under and above  
And every chance i've had  
My love went mad  
Love went mad love went mad  
You you feel like I feel?  
Do you have a heart?  
Do you have a heart of iron and steel?  
  
Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?  
Are you a man now or are you a rat?  
You go to church quiet as a mouse  
You're a big cheese now in the workhouse  
With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef  
I wish you luck with a capital 'f'  
A self-made mug is hard to break  
A silent partner in someone else's mistake  
  
Every day goes by without a hitch  
You feel the urge becoming an itch  
The boys in blue are hard to catch  
They're busy turning piccadilly  
Into brands hatch  
But with your fingers in your ears  
Feeling bright as a button  
Thinking 'thank god there'll be no more  
Lamb dressed as mutton'  
Playing family favorites on a tissue and a comb  
Dying a thousand deaths  
In the safety of your own home

Bad As I Am
Great Big Sea
----------------
Here I go again, my heart's on the line.  
I'm willing to pretend, one more time  
I got some life to spend, on even rhymes  
But when I reach the end, will you (will you) will you be mine?  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I know you're not the answer to my prayer  
And I have grown with each disappointment through the years  
And as bad as I am, and as bad as I am  
I'm still here  
  
On the road again  
I've paid a fine  
Where now is the friend  
I leave (I leave) I leave behind?  
  
I'm goin' 'round the bend  
One more climb  
But when I reach the end  
Will you (will you) will you be mine?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm still here  
I'm still here  
I'm still here  
I'm still

Angel
Lionel Richie
----------------
I just want to tell you all the things you are  
And all the things you mean to me  
You've been with me forever  
Through the changes in my life  
Through all the tears and laughter  
  
When I find myself believing there's no place to go  
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart  
  
You're the answer to my prayers  
And you're with me everywhere  
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight  
Give me shelter from the rain  
You breathe life in me again  
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight  
  
Life is just a moment  
We're blowing in the wind  
We're trying to find a friend  
And only time can tell us  
If win or if we lose  
And who will stand beside us  
  
When there's darkness all around me  
You're the light I see  
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind  
  
You're the answer to my prayers  
And you're with me everywhere  
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight  
Give me shelter from the rain  
You breathe life in me again  
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight  
  
You're all I need tonight  
All I need tonight  
All I need tonight  
You're my angel  
  
You're the answer to my prayers  
And you're with me everywhere  
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight  
Give me shelter from the rain  
You breathe life in me again  
You're my angel, my miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

Tales
Uriah Heep
----------------
We told our tales as we sat under  
Morning's sleepy sky  
With all the colors of  
The sunrise shining in our eyes  
  
One, then another  
With a story of yesterday's life  
Or of a lover who had  
Gone in a moment of strife  
  
No thought of sleep ever dwells  
Upon the wise man's mind  
Some task or audience  
Stealing every moment of his time  
  
Thus we have learned to live  
While mortal men  
Stand waiting to die  
How can we do what must be done  
In just one short life  
  
And if you ask  
Then you must know  
If you still doubt  
You should be told  
It was not we  
That made it so  
It was by those  
Who went before  
  
And there you sit  
Tomorrow's child  
So full of love  
So full of life  
But you must rise  
To meet the day  
Lest you become another tale  
  
Another tale

Work Me Slow
Xscape
----------------
Play me some music, and pour me some wine.  
I'm in the mood now, I got love on my mind.  
I want you to know, that I like it real slow.  
And whenever your ready, you can slide off my clothes.  
And touch my body, anywhere,  
I'm yours tonight, make it right,  
Baby just take me there.  
  
[Chorus]  
Take your time and work me slowly (work it),  
Cause I'm the kind of girl,  
Who needs the kind of guy,  
That can last, (work it).  
Don't need a man around,  
If he's throwin' down too fast,  
You gotta work me slowly.  
  
Now change your position, and keep it right there.  
Just go with my motions, rub you hands through my hair.  
I hope you don't mind it, if I let out a scream,  
Cause it's feeling to good to me, it's more than I dreamed.  
It's more than pleasure, it's ecstasy,  
Up and down, round and round,  
Baby just come with me, take your time.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then in the morning,  
We'll do it all over again,  
(do it all over again)  
I don't want this feeling to never end.  
I can't believe how your loving me,  
You give me all,  
I can't believe your still stroking me,  
Cause baby your taking it all.  
  
[Chorus]

This Is The Picture
Peter Gabriel
----------------
Excellent birds  
  
Flying birds  
Excellent birds  
Watch them fly, there they go  
Falling snow  
Excellent snow  
Here it comes. Watch it fall  
  
Long words  
Excellent words  
I can hear them now  
  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
  
I'm sitting by the window  
Watching the snow fall  
I'm looking out  
And I'm moving, turning in time  
Catching up. Moving in  
Jump up! I can land on my feet. Look out!  
  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
  
Looking out. Watching out  
When I see the future I close my eyes  
I can see it now  
  
I see pictures of people, rising up  
Pictures of people, falling down  
I see pictures of people  
They're standing on their heads, they're ready  
They're looking out, look out!  
They're watching out, watch out!  
They're looking out, look out!  
They're watching out, watch out!  
  
I see pictures of people  
I see pictures of people

Walking Down Madison
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
Walking down madison - I swear I never had a gun  
No I never shot no-one - I was only having fun  
Walking down madison - swear I never had a gun  
I was philosophizing some  
Checking out the bums  
  
See you give 'em your nickels, your pennies and dimes  
But you can't give 'em hope in these mercenary times, oh no  
And you feel real guilty about the coat on your back  
And the sandwich you had, oh no  
  
From an uptown apartment to a knife on the a train  
It's not that far  
From the sharks in the penthouse to the rats in the basement  
It's not that far  
To the bag lady frozen asleep in the park  
Oh no it's not that far  
Would you like to see some more?  
I can show you if you'd like to  
  
Walking down madison - I swear I never had a gun  
No I never shot no-one - wouldn't do it just for fun  
Walking down madison - trying to keep my head screwed on  
I was philosophizing some  
Checking out the nuns  
  
When you get to the corner don't look at those freaks  
Keep your head down low and stay quick on your feet, oh yeah  
The beaming boy from harlem with the airforce coat  
The ones who died  
The ones who tried  
The ones that sit and gloat  
  
From an uptown apartment to a knife on the a train  
It's not that far  
From the sharks in the penthouse to the rats in the basement  
It's not that far  
To the bag lady frozen asleep on the church steps  
It's not that far  
Would you like to see some more?  
I can show you if you'd like to  
  
Within every city and town there's a madison  
Frozen lives for whom nothing's happening  
Hungry children is a mother's dilemma  
Dumpster diving to feed her baby emma  
So you walk on by like it doesn't affect you  
The held out hand that you pay no respect to  
Nickels and dimes won't even buy your guilt  
Another wino burnt to death in his quilt  
It's a cardboard city, newspaper metropolis  
The system can't cope or keep on top of this  
The authorities come as you're not for display  
Do they solve the problem no they move him away  
They're in a vicious circle of no fixed abode  
The social won't pay 'em the money they're owed  
When you've got no money you can't pay rent  
Hypothermia kills ''cause the system is bent  
  
From an uptown apartment to a knife on the a train  
It's not that far  
From the sharks in the penthouse to the rats in the basement  
It's not that far  
To the bag lady frozen asleep in the park  
Oh no it's not that far  
Would you like to see some more?  
I can show you if you'd like to  
  
From an uptown apartment to a knife on the a train  
It's not that far  
From the sharks in the penthouse to the rats in the basement  
It's not that far  
To the bag lady frozen asleep on the church steps  
It's not that far  
Would you like to see some more?  
I can show you if you'd like to  
  
In the subway sits a vacuous man  
His grip on life is a bent tin can  
It's a holy shrine where he burns his light  
It makes things easy and removes his plight  
For an hour or two but he can't escape  
They're all penned in with government tape  
There are good samaritans who bring the soup  
The sally army with their bibles and boots  
You can see yourself as it's not too far  
One short trip you don't who they are  
Till the night comes then it all comes back  
Like the smell of patchouli and the armies of rats  
It's a shame to be human it's a human shame  
It seems we've forgotten we're one and the same

Bugs On My Nuts
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
Well, I don't understand the phenomenon  
We fucking these hoes that look like spallala  
Rich boys think that is shitty  
But I like fucking crack heads with one titie  
  
And I do it at the drop of a dime  
And I get the scabies almost every time  
So, let's talk about my nut sac  
I don't front, Jack, I got bugs on my ball sac  
  
Well, I'm Violent J and I ain't no bitch  
I'm always quick to tell you when my nuts itch  
'Cuz bitch, if I'm itching when I come home  
Drop a brick in a sock, swing it on your dome  
  
You didn't think nothing of it, just let me stick it  
Probably should of known 'cuz I thought I heard crickets  
In your neden but I ain't sayin' nuttin' though  
I ain't sayin' nuttin' till I'm done nuttin', ho  
  
And know I'm like, "bitch how can this be  
Tryin' to sleep and my nuts get up and watch tv  
Then try to walk to the store and get a 40  
How'd these bugs get on me? "  
  
Somebody asked me, how I got scabies  
Probably that homeless, fat, redneck bag lady  
That I fucked in the shed  
Then the little critters on my dingaling said  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts"  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts"  
  
Supurs on my boots and I don't give a hoot  
'Cuz I got me a prudy womans love  
  
I met this bitch and went up in it  
Dropped her off, went to the clinic  
Bitch, I got bizugs on my siznac  
So, tell me, what's up with that?  
  
Should of said something 'bout your bug problem  
Now, I'm gonna have to sock you in your mouth, bitch  
Can't keep my motherfucking hands out my drawers  
Stick a roach motel up under your balls  
  
Nah, I'd rather stick 'em in a deep fry  
And sizzle those motherfuckers off my wang  
So, you wanna fuck around, always gotta buck around  
Lift up your dingaling nothing but a bug ya found  
  
Now, they call you funky nuts 'cuz you like funky butts  
Scratching and biting them, now they call you monkey nuts  
But I ain't sayin' nothing 'cuz you ain't playin' nothin'  
Bring the track back and I get back to the nut sac track  
  
So, now I try to rap 'cuz the bugs is biting  
But I ain't going out like a bitch, yo, fuck that  
Stick 'em in a blender and hit the switch  
Then I hit the bitch  
  
Met this bum in the back of a dumpster  
Fucked her in the rumpster, juggaluga humpster  
Had to take a piss, so I pulled out my wang  
Then I heard my dingaling sang  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts"  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts"  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts"  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty sluts"  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts  
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts"  
  
"Your nuts, we want your nuts  
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts  
Your nuts, we want your nuts

"Your nuts, we want your nuts

Dodo
David Bowie
----------------
Now we can talk in confidence  
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?  
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line  
Such a shameless design  
  
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top  
It's a shame that his children disagree  
They coolly decide to sell him down the line  
Daddy's brainwashing time  
  
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
  
She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore  
When a unit was a figure, not a she  
When lovers chose each other, now the perks are due  
Another memo to screw  
  
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
  
Can you wipe your nose, my child  
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?  
Can you sleep alone at night  
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim?  
He's come to turn you in  
  
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
Another dodo, didn't hear it from me

Road Ladies
Nazareth
----------------
By: frank zappa as performed by nazareth  
Said, don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever get sad when you go out on the road?  
No, don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever get sad when you come here to seattle  
On a four day show of the tour  
And you got nothing but groupies and promotors to love you  
And a pile of laundry by the hotel door.  
Don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever make a young man blue?  
Don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever make a young man where he'll just wanna go back home?  
When the p.a. system eats it,  
And the band plays some of the most terriblest shit you've ever known.  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you.  
I swear someday I ain't never,  
I'm never gonna go out on the road again.  
I swear someday I ain't never, never, never, never,  
Never, never, never, never, never, never  
Gonna roam the country side.  
No more.  
I'm gonna hang up them ol' holiday inns, dude  
And watchin someone do it on the floor  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you.  
What the road ladies do to you!

Sweet Little Sixteen
Chuck Berry
----------------
They're really rockin' Boston  
In Pittsburgh, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
And down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
Sweet little sixteen  
She's just got to have  
About half a million  
Framed autographs  
Her wallet filled with pictures  
She gets 'em one by one  
Become so excited  
Watch her, look at her run  
  
Oh mommy mommy  
Please may I go  
It's such a sight to see  
Somebody steal the show  
Oh daddy daddy  
I beg of you  
Whisper to mommy  
It's all right with you  
  
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  
In Philadelphia P.A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
Way down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  
Philadelphia P.A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
Way down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
Sweet little sixteen  
She's got the grown up blues  
Tight dresses and lipstick  
She's sportin' high heel shoes  
Oh, but tomorrow morning  
She'll have to change her trend  
And be sweet sixteen  
And back in class again  
  
Well they'll be rockin' Boston  
Pittsburgh, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
Way out in St. Louis  
Way down to New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen

All I Want Is A Life
Tim McGraw
----------------
I just want to get a little more out of my payday  
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway  
A little vacation, ain't asking very much  
  
I keep coming home to this old broken down apartment  
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet  
Well I don't want it all, but I ain't got enough  
  
[CHORUS]  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'  
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'  
Want to give her that diamond, I never got to buy  
She keeps tellin' me that everything is getting better  
But one step up the wrung and someone knocks me off the ladder  
Just want to break even someday before I die  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life

I Feel The Dark
Opeth
----------------
I feel the dark when I see you  
I feel the dark when I see you  
  
Loosen the harness of trust  
Survey an impulse of lust  
The thespian is far away  
Uprooted yet forced to stay  
  
Sing a lie, ghost of the night  
Give yourself to me  
The road is long and winding still  
And these bonds will stay to fray  
But another day  
  
A flaking wish inside  
  
Veiled comes the daylight through the glass  
In the never-ending rain  
This is no friend of mine  
Stalking the comfort within  
  
A flaking wish inside  
The mother of lies  
  
And you're going out to war  
When the beast is coming home  
And the sun is seen no more  
For the devil's love you bore  
  
I feel the dark when I see you

Akap
Imago
----------------
Nagtatanong  
Bakit mahirap  
Sumabay sa agos  
Ng iyong mundo  
  
Nagtataka  
Simple lang naman sana  
Ang buhay  
Kung ika'y matino  
  
(Chorus)  
Sabihin sa akin lahat ng lihim mo  
Iingatan ko  
Ibaling sa akin ang problema mo  
Kakayanin ko  
  
Pikit mata  
Kong iaalay  
Ang buwan at araw  
Pati pa sapatos kong suot  
  
Nagtatanong  
Simple lang naman sana  
Ang buhay  
Kung ika'y lumayo  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Sasamahan ka sa tamis (sasamahan ka tamis)  
Sasamahan ka sa dilim (Sasamahan ka sa dilim)  
Sasamahan ka hanggang langit (Sasamahan ka hanggang langit)  
Sasamahan ka sa tamis (Sasamahan ka sa tamis)  
Sasamahan ka sa pait (Sasamahan ka sa pait)  
Sasamahan ka sa dilim (Sasamahan ka sa dilim)  
Sasamahan ka hanggang langit (Sasamahan ka hanggang langit )  
Sasamahan ka (Sasamahan ka)  
  
Oh. ohh. ohh... ohhohh...

Just Like Me
Britney Spears
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Got those heels on that you love  
The ones that drive you crazy  
Exactly what you're dreaming of  
I'll give it to you, baby  
150 miles away  
Singing out my lungs  
Driving fast all through L.A  
Warming up my tongue  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Heart's beating fast  
When I'm turning the key  
I see you on your back  
And I just can't believe

She looks just like me, just like me  
No, I just can't believe  
She looks just like me, just like me  
Just like me, ooh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Before I think, I start to run  
But you can't even face me  
Know exactly what you've done  
Know exactly, baby

Pictures, they flash  
And I can't even sleep  
I see you on your back  
And I just can't believe

She looks just like me, just like me  
No, I just can't believe  
She looks just like me, just like me  
Just like me, ooh

She can, she can, she can have you  
She can, she can, she can have you  
She can, she can, she can

Pictures, they flash  
And I can't even sleep  
I see you on your back  
And I just can't believe

No, I just can't believe  
She looks just like me, just like me  
Just like me, just like me

Skin On My Skin
Incognito
----------------
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
Looking back how I wish I had told you what was on my mind  
Looking back, wish I had, said what was on my mind  
Reason away, reason away, I can't reason away my pain  
I cannot ease my pain  
  
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
I turn out the lights and I'm alone  
You're not coming home  
I miss your skin on my skin  
  
This feeling I know can't be compared  
Nothing can replace  
The feel of your skin on my skin  
I'm mystified, don't know how I let you slip away  
Mystified, don't know how I let you slip away  
Come back baby, come back is all that I can say  
  
Come back baby is all I can say  
I turn out the lights and I'm alone  
You're not coming home  
I miss your skin on my skin  
This feeling I know can't be compared  
Nothing can replace  
  
The feel of your skin on my skin  
Missin', I'm missin'  
the feel of your skin  
Missin', I'm missin', missin'  
On my skin  
Missin', I'm missin',  
Missin', I'm missin', missin'

Black Sabbath
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
What is this that stands before me  
Figure in black which points at me  
Turn 'round quick and start to run  
Find out I'm the chosen one  
  
Oh, no  
  
Big black shape with eyes of fire  
Telling people their desire  
Satan sitting there, he's smiling  
Watches those flame get higher and higher  
  
Oh, god, lease help me  
Oh, no, no  
  
Child cries out for its mother  
Mother screaming in the fire  
Satan points at me again  
Opens the door to push me in  
  
Oh, no  
Oh, god  
  
Is it the end my friend  
Satan's coming 'round the bend  
People running 'cause they're scared  
You people better go and beware  
  
No, no  
Please, god, no

You take the train from Yuma,  
Down to Mexicali,  
And by the crack of midnight  
You've got that border town fever,

In back of She Cat Alley

In an elevator  
Three days later Mexicali Bella  
Bella voodoo  
Americano don't know what he do

Merry Chistmas Strait To You
George Strait
----------------
It's Christmas time  
I see the lines of people everywhere tryin' to pick out the gifts  
That show how much they care  
It makes me wish that I could see my friends on Christmas Day  
And fill my list with lots of gifts but I can only say  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin' blue  
Right or wrong I'll sing my song and you will know just who sings  
A merry Christmas strait to you  
  
There's lot of ways to share the days of Christmas with your friends  
A Christmas card, a tree that stars and gifts that make you grin  
I'd like to share this song with everyone who came our way  
Without a doubt the fires not out it burns for you today  
  
So here's a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feeling blue  
You've been so kind you crossed my mind and nothing less will do  
Here's a merry Christmas strait to you  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas  
And to all who might have missed us  
A very, merry Christmas strait to you

Smile
Josh Groban
----------------
Smile though your heart is aching  
Smile even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by  
If you smile through your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You'll see the sun come shining through  
For you  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear may be ever so near  
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just smile  
  
When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by  
If you smile  
And maybe tomorrow  
You'll see the sun come shining through  
For you  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear may be ever so near  
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just smile

Animal Nation
Peter Gabriel
----------------
I didn't meet you in the jungle  
Swinging from a tree  
I sat down at the piano  
You were playing with me  
I couldn't believe all the things you could do  
The apes I've seen were in the zoo  
  
They say we are unique with this language that we speak  
But you have proved them wrong  
Skinner and Chomsky, how could they be so blind  
With evidence this strong?  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
When you watch King Kong or The Planet of the Apes  
Upon your video screen  
When the animals die, tears fill your eye  
And you question what you've seen  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where I come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to me now  
I am listening  
  
You can search the internet  
You can use your video phone  
To call another friend  
If we gave you all the tools  
You can do whatever you want  
Who knows when this will end  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where I come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to me now  
I am listening  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where we come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to us now  
We are listening  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Starting to hear the things you've said  
Getting to know what's going on in your head  
There's no humans on the line  
But there'll be plenty more there in good time  
Dolphins, cats, and elephants  
This is not some wild romance  
Just look in their eyes and say it's not true  
Look in their eyes, they're checking out you  
  
Communication with the Animal Nation  
We are in communication with the Animal Nation x20

A Little More Love
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
Night is draggin' her feet  
I wait alone in the heat  
I know know that you have your way  
'Til you have to go home.  
"No" 's a word I can't say.  
  
But it gets me nowhere to tell you "no"  
It gets me nowhere to make you go  
Will a little more love make you  
Star depending  
Will a little more love  
Bring a happy ending  
Will a little more love make it right  
Will a little more love make it right.  
  
Where did my innocence go  
How, how was a young girl to know  
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes  
In the warmth of your arms  
In the web of your lies.  
  
But it gets me nowhere to tell you "no"

Brothers Of The Highway
George Strait
----------------
Diamonds on the windshield, as heaven starts to cry,  
In his rear-view mirror, his angle waves goodbye,  
She knows he's got to go, she knows he's one of them,  
  
[Chorus]  
Brothers of the highway, children of the wind,  
That Detroit diesel pirate ship goes rollin' out again,  
Sailin' for that settin' sun, freedoms your best friend,  
Brothers of the highway, children of the wind.  
  
He putts the peddle to the metal, trying to out run the rain,  
Another shot of truck stop coffee, goes runnin' through his veins,  
This country turns on eighteen wheels, thank god we can depend, on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Carolina west to Denver, Batton Rouge east to Pittsburgh, Portland south to
San Diego, sail on sail on, Tallahassee north to Boston, up to  
Bangor west to Austin, coast to coast sea to sea sail on sail on, you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
God bless you brothers of the highway, children of the wind.

Little Girl Blue
Diana Ross
----------------
When I was very young  
The world was younger than I  
As merry as a carousel  
  
The circustent was strong  
With every star in the sky  
Above the ring I loved so well  
  
Now the young world has grown old  
Gone are the tinsle and gold  
  
Sit there and count your fingers  
What can you do?  
Oh girl you're through  
All you can count on are your fingers  
Unlucky little girl blue  
  
Sit there and count the raindrops  
Falling on you  
It's time you knew  
All you can count on are the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
  
No use oh girl  
You may as well surrender  
Your hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer little girl blue

My Father's Son
Pearl Jam
----------------
I come from a genius, I am my father's son  
Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath and now I'm the next in line  
Lonely nest dear mother, yes, surely she's a work of art  
I never got top dollar, but she gave us all a star  
  
Can I get a reprieve?  
This gene pool don't hurt me  
Can I beg a release  
From the volunteer amputee?  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Got me tooth and nail  
  
Yeah, how's about one conversation with nothing else left to be had  
Oh, is this your long lost son, and he's never had dear old dad  
I forget the insemination and for that I'm supposed to be glad  
What a pity you left us so soon to climb your mountain of regret  
  
Can I get a reprieve?  
This gene pool dark and deep  
Can I beg a release?  
Can I volunteer amputee?  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal?  
Oh I gotta set sail  
  
Oh real bright light shining as you're trying to breathe in thin air  
Cannot forget you're hiding collected wounds left unhealed  
When every thought you're thinking sinks you darker than the new moon sky  
The faraway lights rising in the whites of your eyes  
  
Now father you're dead and gone and I'm finally free to be me  
Thanks for all your dark gifts for which I've got no sympathy  
I'm living in a walled-up place in the bounds of fifth symphony  
Thanks for this and thanks for that, I gotta let go, learn to see legacy  
  
Can I get a reprieve?  
This gene pool don't hurt me  
Can I beg a release?  
Can I volunteer amputee?  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Oh I gotta set sail

Breaking Up Is Hard To Do
Carpenters
----------------
You tell me that you're leavin',  
I can't believe it's true!  
Girl, there's just no livin' without you.  
Don't take your love away from me.  
Don't you leave my heart in misery.  
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,  
Breakin' up is hard to do.  
  
Remember when you held me tight,  
And you kissed me all through the night.  
Think of all that we been through,  
And breakin' up is hard to do.  
  
They say that breakin' up is hard to do,  
Now I know, I know that it's true.  
Don't say that this is the end.  
Instead of breakin' up I wish that  
We were makin' up again.  
  
I beg of you don't say goodbye,  
Can't we give our love just one more try?  
Come on baby, let's start anew,  
Breakin' up is hard to do.

If We Crawl
Beautiful South
----------------
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twenty-two  
And grovel at  
The drop of a hat  
  
And once they've got you down there  
It's so hard to re-straighten your back  
It we crawl at two  
We could crawl at one handred and two  
  
And the target brainless don't quite reach  
Covered so kindly in your opening speech  
Is a tiny crab of thought, crab of thought  
On a sideways beach  
  
Let lessons not the pupils teach  
Justice not the lesers breach  
And maggots not have fingers  
Wagged at by leech  
  
Well I made sure  
I wrote this song in braille  
So you could touch the words  
The words that sail  
  
From my mouth back to the jail  
You could touch the words that sail  
From the mouth back to the jail  
That is posing as tongue  
  
Curtsies, bows, thank you sirs  
And the wearing of a business suit  
Lead to complaints of backache  
And end with a Nazi salute  
  
And once they've got you down there  
It's so hard to re-straighten your back  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at two two two  
  
And the target brainless don't quite reach  
Covered so kindly in your opening speech  
Is a tiny crab of thought, crab of thought  
On a sideways beach  
  
Let lessons not the pupils teach  
Justice not the lesers breach  
And maggots not have fingers  
Wagged at by leech  
  
Well I made sure  
I wrote this song in braille  
So you could touch the words  
The words that sail  
  
From my mouth back to the jail  
You could touch the words that sail  
From the mouth back to the jail That is posing as tongue  
  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twenty-two  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twenty-two

I Never Did Sing You A Love Song
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
(Nichtern)  
I never did sing you a love song  
I only sang phrases in time  
I never did write you a sonnet  
I just laid my WORDS down in rhymes  
Up and down the river, so many boats to ride  
Yet precious few deliver the goods that we need to survive  
I never spoke falsely or crossly  
I never put tears in your eyes  
And you never shattered my lonely heart  
You never deceived me with lies  
And yet somehow I seem to recall I STIRRED in my sleep for a while  
Dreaming of a river man exchanging my life for a smile

When A Child Is Born
Moody Blues
----------------
A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny spark lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
It's all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon, somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born.

Bring On The Night
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
I lie in bed but baby I can't sleep no matter how hard I try  
There's something bad, baby, wrong with me whenever I close my eyes  
The dreams of Mary keep me awake with every little curve in place  
When I walk home in the daybreak I pray come back home, baby, won't you give
me  
Darlin' bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night  
  
I walk the street, I'm lookin' for romance  
I end up stumblin' in some stupid half-trance  
As I watch the lovers mix with circumstance  
We watch the disco dancers dance  
  
I look for connection in some new eyes  
But for protection they're tranquilized  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who lies  
  
Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night  
  
Is it as simple as it seems  
I don't know what I'm doin' here, is it as simple as it seems  
Is it as simple as I fear, well if I'm right...  
  
I look for connection in some new eyes  
But for protection they're tranquilized  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Baby of who's tellin' who lies  
  
Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night, oh now darlin', bring on the night  
Come on darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin' bring on the night

Diamonds Are Forever
Chaka Khan
----------------
(Donald Black, John Barry)  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
They are all I need to please me,  
They can stimulate and tease me,  
They won't leave in the night,  
I've no fear that they might desert me.  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
Hold one up and then caress it,  
Touch it, stroke it and undress it,  
I can see ev'ry part,  
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.  
I don't need love,  
For what good will love do me?  
Diamonds never lie to me,  
For when love's gone,  
They'll lustre on.  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
Sparkling round my little finger.  
Unlike men, the diamonds linger

Earl Of Roseland
Styx
----------------
Written by Dennis DeYoung  
Lead vocals by Dennis DeYoung  
  
oh oh oh oh oh  
  
penny pitching on the walk  
waiting for the bus to arrive  
me and Davy playing sport  
watching for the cops to go by  
  
spider man and the human torch  
they cover Barney's newsstand  
morning crowds start to gather round  
fast finger steals what he can  
  
morning leaves for the afternoon  
the boys show up on time  
in the streets near the people's store  
below the electrical sign  
  
catch a glimpse of a passing car  
raced and ready to drag  
then the skirts start to tantalize  
the boys how they boast and they brag  
  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
  
where has he gone?  
a memory at dawn  
you're just a bit of the past  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
oh oh oh oh  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
  
me and Davy gazing back  
see ourselves as we were  
how we laugh when we think of things  
that we did yesteryear  
  
I can see Charlie on the porch  
Johnny clicking his sticks  
and two boys I don't even know  
rehearsing electric string tricks  
ya ya ya ya ya ya  
  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland

The Possession
King Diamond
----------------
On the very next morning  
When the mist was eaten away by the sun  
Miriam grew hour by hour and  
Jonathan he cried  
He knew the ghost had been telling the truth  
So this was 9  
The pregnancy would not last overnight  
  
Oh she started singing  
A lullaby, rocking the cradle again  
And then she said  
I'm having your baby my love, love  
But it wasn't love, oh no  
She was possessed, and he knew  
  
I will get what is rightfully mine  
  
Speaking with different tongues  
Miriam was eaten alive from inside  
Again she said  
I'm having your baby my love, love  
But it wasn't love, oh no  
She was possessed, possessed

A House In The Country
Kinks
----------------
He don't need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind.  
At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind.  
Why should he care if he is hated in his home,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
He's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
  
But he ain't gotta home, oh no,  
And he's as wicked as he can be,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right  
  
Well, he got his job when drunken Daddy tumbled down the stairs.  
From that very day this boy is more than having his share.  
One of these days I'm gonna knock him off of his throne,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
He's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
  
And he's oh so smug, oh yeah.  
He's got everything he needs,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right  
  
And he's oh so smug, oh yeah.  
He's got everything he needs,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
He's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
  
But he's socially dead, oh yeah,  
And it don't matter much to him,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right  
  
House in the country  
House in the country  
House in the country  
House in the country

Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Those days are over  
You don't have to sell your body to the night  
Roxanne, you don't have to wear that dress tonight  
Walk the streets for money  
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right  
  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Put on the red light, put on the red light  
Put on the red light, put on the red light  
Put on the red light, oh  
  
I loved you since I knew ya  
I wouldn't talk down to ya  
I have to tell you just how I feel  
I won't share you with another boy  
I know my mind is made up  
So put away your make up  
Told you once I won't tell you again it's a bad way  
  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Put on the red light, put on the red light

Down For Whatever
Ice Cube
----------------
Damn.  
I'm broke.  
My feet hurt.  
(Inside the mind of a car jacker)  
And that bitch is slippin'.  
It makes me wanna, creep.  
It makes me wanna, creep.  
  
Damn I'm such a G it's pathetic  
Here comes the big headed  
Nigga that's dippin'  
Sippin' on Courvoisier  
Goddamn I must havta floss today  
Now pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary  
So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry  
I'll put the pedal to the flo-uh  
In my two-tone Ford Explo-uh  
You know how it's done  
Sounds bumpin  
Ain't that somethin'?  
Jumped on the 110  
She's flyin' in the Blazer  
Like "Go Speed Racer"  
But I ain't gonna chase her  
Like Racer X  
But I won't flex  
Til it's time to have sex  
So when you want to get together?  
Cause you know a nigga like me  
Is down for whatever  
  
And I'm down for whatever  
  
When I was little I didn't want to be like Mike  
I wanted to be like Ike  
Cause  
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties  
And he liked green like Bill Bixby  
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty  
Pokets never skinny  
Played let's get it on in the living room  
And hwne he gets drunk you better give him room  
Cause he'll turn the party out sayin', "This is my motherfuckin' house"  
And y'all gots to go  
Through the door  
And if you can't find the door  
He'll help you with the four-four  
Talkin' much shit on the grass  
And straight down to blast  
I'm still in my p.j.'s  
He's in a turtleneck sweater  
And we down for whatever  
  
And I'm down  
Solid Pro is down for whatever  
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever  
And it don't seem to stop  
  
Now  
I don't talk a lot of shit  
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go  
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead  
Then my niggas wearin' blue or red  
Cause I got the gift  
To hit these hos swift  
And I'm smellin' like a fifth  
Of somethin'  
Yeah, that's right  
I'm standin' in the store  
Koreans  
Act so nice  
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells  
Doughnut  
And you know what?  
I'm Cool Like That like Digable Planets  
But don't take a nigga for granted  
Cause whether it's a verdict of the L.A. four  
You just don't know  
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather  
And be down for whatever  
  
And I'm down  
Creep.  
And I'm down for whatever  
  
Ice Cube, devoid of pop  
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas  
  
It makes me wanna, creep.  
It makes me wanna, creep.

Caravan
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan  
  
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep  
Across the sand so I may keep  
The memory of our caravan  
  
This is so exciting  
You are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
As I thrill to the magic charms  
  
Of you beside me here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan!

I Ran
Nazareth
----------------
We made a promise  
But what's the difference  
Call me friend, what you calling for  
You couldn't take me as I am  
But that was only party chat, I ran.  
  
You asked me up here  
You said it was "gear"  
So Liverpool but  
We never understood the slang  
We couldn't sing it like they sang  
But that was carnaby excuses, I ran.  
  
Like rent-a-driver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You can only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you leave it  
  
Call me baby, how our love grows  
Supremely simple  
Like baby, baby, baby  
You're out of time  
  
Shine, shine shine  
Don't call me shine  
But there's no rhythm to your rhyme, I ran.  
  
Like rent-a-driver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you  
Break a promise  
But what's the difference  
Call me friend--what you callin' for  
You couldn't take me as I am  
But that was only party chat, I ran.

Little Boy Blue
Chaka Khan
----------------
Time comes down  
You got to take it on yourself  
You got to give up your past  
You got to give up what came last  
World goes round  
You got to leave it all behind  
You got defeated at last  
  
Little boy blue  
With the feelin' in your soul and the gypsy in your eyes  
Little boy blue  
You got to leave this song behind as it passes by  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Life goes on  
You got to catch it if you can  
You must believe it will last  
You can't remember what went past  
Tide comes in  
This fog will surely roll away  
It can't leave, it will stay  
  
Little boy blue  
Tootin' on your coke and takin' a toke  
In a lazy haze  
Little boy blue  
Got to leave this song behind as it passes by  
  
Tide comes in  
This boat will surely row away  
It can't leave if we stay  
  
Little boy blue  
Tootin' on your coke and takin' a toke  
In a lazy haze  
Little boy blue  
Got to leave this song behind as it passes by

Scare Me
Kenny Chesney
----------------
I'm not afraid of lonely  
I've gotten good at being that  
Ain't seen nothin' that could hold me  
Say good-bye and don't look back  
  
Running, always ready  
Feel as strong and steady  
But you scare me  
  
Took a long walk after midnight  
Trying to make sense of it all  
Tried to catch a glimpse of my old life  
But your face was all I saw  
  
Blue eyes staring through me  
Baby, what are you doing to me  
You (never felt this before, it's all brand new to me, never known anyone)
scare me  
You (I'm doing what I said I would never do, too late to stop it now) scare me  
  
Knowing there's no turning back  
Knowing I don't want to  
  
Baby you (never felt this before, it's all brand new to me, never known
anyone) scare me  
You (I'm doing what I said I would never do, too late to stop it now) scare me  
Scare me  
Scare me  
Baby you scare me  
Scare me

[From Mark Knopfler's "Sailing To Philadelphia"]  
  
I Am Jeremiah Dixon  
I Am A Geordie Boy  
A Glass Of Wine With You, Sir  
And The Ladies I'll Enjoy  
All Durham And Northumberland  
Is Measured Up By My Own Hand  
It Was My Fate From Birth  
To Make My Mark Upon The Earth...  
  
He Calls Me Charlie Mason  
A Stargazer Am I  
It Seems That I Was Born  
To Chart The Evening Sky  
They'd Cut Me Out For Baking Bread  
But I Had Other Dreams Instead  
This Baker's Boy From The West Country  
Would Join The Royal Society...  
  
We Are Sailing To Philadelphia  
A World Away From The Coaly Tyne  
Sailing To Philadelphia  
To Draw The Line  
The Mason-Dixon Line  
  
Now You're A Good Surveyor, Dixon  
But I Swear You'll Make Me Mad  
The West Will Kill Us Both  
You Gullible Geordie Lad  
You Talk Of Liberty  
How Can America Be Free  
A Geordie And A Baker's Boy  
In The Forests Of The Iroquois...  
  
Now Hold Your Head Up, Mason  
See America Lies There  
The Morning Tide Has Raised  
The Capes Of Delaware  
Gome Up And Feel The Sun  
A New Morning Is Begun  
Another Day Will Make It Clear  
Why Your Stars Should Guide Us Here...  
  
We Are Sailing To Philadelphia  
A World Away From The Coaly Tyne  
Sailing To Philadelphia  
To Draw The Line  
The Mason-Dixon Line

Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes
Conway Twitty
----------------
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night, in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Or keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return  
And you know you're the only one  
I'll ever love.  
  
Too many miles, too many days  
Too many nights to be alone  
Please keep your heart while we are apart  
Don't linger in the moonlight while I'm gone  
  
Too many miles, too many days  
Too many nights to be alone  
Oh, please keep your heart while we are apart  
Don't stand in the moonlight while I'm gone.  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night, in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Or keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return And you know  
You're the only one I'll ever love.  
  
Too many miles, too many days  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes

Burn On
Cliff Richard
----------------
You light the light in my dark places  
The brightest smile in a sea of faces  
Oh you watched me  
You calmed me down just when I thought  
I'd drown  
You lit a flame inside  
I don''t know how  
But they cannot turn the light out on me now  
  
You put a song in my dark silence  
You moved my feet when I could not dance  
And you caught me just when I fell  
You stilled my hell of storms  
You coloured all my greys  
I don't know how  
And they cannot turn the light out on me now  
  
CHORUS Burn on, oh lovely light  
Burn on, there goes the night  
Burn on till all the universe is shining in your light  
Burn on, burn on, burn on

I'll wake you tomorrow  
And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill.

And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill.

I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind  
Just the way it used to sound, through the Georgia pines  
You were there to answer when I called, yeah

Remember how I used to touch your hands  
While reachin' for the feeling that was always there  
You're the best thing in my life I can recall, oh  
You and me we had it all  
  
I know that we can never lives these times again  
So I'll let these dreams take me back to where we've been  
Then I stay there with you just as long as I can  
  
Oh, it was so good, yeah, it was so good  
Oh, it was so good, when I was your man  
And I never stop believin' your smile  
Even though it didn't stay, it was all worthwhile  
  
Yes, you're the best thing in my life I can recall, oh  
You and me we had it all  
You and me we had it all

It looks as though tomorrow  
I'll do pretty much the same  
I must turn down your offer  
But I'd like to ask a break  
You know I'm ready to give everything  
For anything I take  
Someone called my name  
You know I turned around to see  
It was midnight in the mission  
And the bells were not for me  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Ten years ago, I walked this street  
My dreams were riding tall  
Tonight I would be thankful Lord  
For any dream at all  
Some folks would be happy  
Just to have one dream come true  
But everything you gather  
Is just more that you can lose  
Someone called my name  
You know I turned around to see  
It was midnight in the mission  
And the bells were not for me  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
All the things I planned to do  
I only did half way  
Tomorrow will be Sunday  
Born of rainy Saturday  
There's some satisfaction  
In the San Francisco rain  
No matter what comes down  
The mission always looks the same  
Someone called my name  
You know I turned around to see  
It was midnight in the mission  
And the bells were not for me  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain

Slayer
----------------
Driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind  
Sexual release buried deep inside  
Complete control of a prized possession  
To touch and fondle with no objection  
Lonely souls an emptiness fulfilled  
Physical pleasures an addictive thrill  
An object of perverted reality  
An obsession beyond your wildest dreams  
  
The Death loves final embrace  
Your cool tenderness  
Memories keep love alive  
Memories will never die  
  
The excitement of dissection is sweet  
My skin crawls with orgasmic speed  
A lifeless object for my subjection  
An obsession beyond your imagination  
Primitive instinct a passion for flesh  
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death  
Sadistic acts a love so true  
Absorbingly masticating a part of you  
  
Death loves final embrace  
Your cool tenderness  
Memories keep love alive  
Memories will never die  
  
I need a friend  
Please be my companion  
I don't want to be  
Alone with my sanity  
  
Erotic sensations tingle my spine  
A dead body lying next to mine  
Smooth blue black lips  
I start salivating as we kiss  
Mine forever this sweet death  
I cannot forget all your breaths  
Panting excitedly with my hands around  
Your neck  
  
Shades are drawn  
No one out can see  
What I've done  
What's become of me  
Here I stand  
Above all that's been true  
How I love  
How I love to kill you

Overkill
----------------
We got the killing  
You got the time  
We got the making of a terminal blind  
  
We got the risk  
You got to take  
We got the making of a big mistake  
  
Got no faith  
Got no reason  
Got no hope  
Got the treason  
  
We got the hit  
already took  
Hate to tell you  
But I think you're fuct  
  
All about face  
All about life  
All about walking the edge of the knife  
All about race  
All about death  
All about getting out of this mess  
  
We got the truth  
You got the hurt  
We got the answer that you just insert  
  
We are explicit  
You are expossed  
We are the making of the decomposed  
  
Got no faith  
Got no reason  
Got no hope  
Got the treason  
  
Got the kaos  
Runamuk  
Bite down hard  
You're about to be fuct  
  
All about face  
All about life  
All about walking the edge of the knife  
All about race  
All about death  
All about getting out of this mess  
  
We are the day  
We are the night  
We are the stop sign in the road of life  
  
We are the message  
Unreturned  
We are the next about to be burned  
  
Got no faith  
Got no reason  
Got no hope  
Got the treason  
  
Change your mind  
Change your look  
Change your heart  
Now you're fuct  
  
All about face  
All about life  
All about walking the edge of the knife  
All about race  
All about death  
All about getting out of this mess  
All about face

My Old Flame
Billie Holiday
----------------
My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But it's funny now and then  
How my thoughts go flashing back again  
To my old flame  
My old flame  
My new lovers all seem so tame  
For I haven't met a gent  
  
So innocent or elegant  
As my old flame  
  
I've met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But I'll never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame  
  
I've met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But I'll never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame

The Very Thought Of You
Andy Williams
----------------
The very thought of you  
And I forget to do  
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do  
I'm living in a kind of daydream  
I'm happy as a king  
And foolish though it may seem  
To me that's everything  
The mere idea of you  
The longing here for you  
You'll never know how slow the moments go  
Till I'm near to you  
I see your face in every flower  
Your eyes in stars above  
It's just the thought of you  
The very thought of you  
My love

Ma' Dear Ma' Dear
Chuck Berry
----------------
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, she told me one day  
That I'd meet my true love and take her away  
She said I'd be happy and to be good and true  
I'd never be lonely, broken hearted or blue  
  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, just like you said  
I met my true love one and we are to wed  
Ma' dear, she's an angel and I'm goin' to be true  
Or else I may lose her, I don't want to lose her to somebody new  
  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, I was not untrue  
I tried hard to please her, but she's gone and I'm blue  
Ma' dear, I'm so lonesome, broken hearted, too  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, oh, Ma' dear, what must I do?

Crossing Over
Ufo
----------------
I see the lights,  
I see the road  
I see everything in the  
Highway code  
I've been whipped  
And I've been spun cown  
There ain't no religion here  
And I'm homeward bound  
  
Wherever you go,  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
Friendships come  
And lifetimes go  
In their passing to the  
Bigger show  
The river runs,  
The tides will turn  
If there's a hell,  
Well I've yet to learn  
  
Wherever you go,  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
To dream the dream that's over  
Before it's gone  
To hold your lover here  
While your heart beats so strong  
Baby when I love you  
When everything is gone  
When I'm kissing heaven  
This love is never wrong  
  
Solo  
  
I hear the singing,  
I hear the shout  
The talk of meaning  
For those in doubt  
But amid all the wailing and  
The wringing hands  
Everybody thinks  
Does anyone understand?  
  
Wherever you go,  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
'cause I am crossing over  
To the other side

Stand A Little Rain
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band
----------------
Dark cloud is coming  
Headed straight for your heart  
Might get just a little bit crazy, baby  
Might try to tear us apart  
  
When the storm blows over  
Only the true love remains  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
Everybody wants love to be easy  
But it's never been that way  
Each love starts out with blue skies  
Sometimes those blue skies turn grey  
  
When the storm blows over  
Only the strong love remains  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightning strikes  
Hold on, darling  
It's gonna be alright  
  
'Cause when the storm blows over  
Only the true love remains  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain  
  
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow  
We have to stand a little rain

Conditioning
Howard Jones
----------------
Well you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Well we think that you are john or dave  
But you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Jumbled mass of preconceived ideas  
  
From our birth we were given an identity  
People told us we were great or small  
From our birth we were given rules of right or wrong  
Not forgetting the bullies at school  
  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
And as the world makes us feel great  
And as the world makes us feel small  
Oh so convinced of our identity  
If we only knew it we just can't believe it we just won't believe it  
  
Leading us to think that we are such a success  
Conning us to think that we are just a failure  
Leading us to think that we are so intelligent  
Conning us to think that we are just a do-do do-do  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Er, sorry, ha ha  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning

White Wall
Bob Seger
----------------
Springtime of new years, the young thoughts see more dreams  
While you live on the wind, how lovely it all seems  
With moments yet unshared, and wishes incomplete  
The stars above your head, the world beneath your feet  
  
Suddenly your nights, begin to seem so long  
There's no one there to touch, when things start going wrong  
You finally realise, you've never loved at all  
And everywhere you look, you see the white wall  
  
Your father's been too far, your mother's been too near  
And now you're on your own, withdrawing in your fear  
Through long and sleepless nights, the foxes are running free  
You long to be with them, when the scare meets the sea  
  
You climb and then you fall, and then you try again  
You curse yourself aloud, for living so weird  
And took it to the ground, your eyes are filled with tears  
Imprisoned there you lay, in the autumn of your years

My White Bicycle
Nazareth
----------------
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
Riding all around the street  
Four o'clock and they're all asleep  
I'm not tired and it's so late  
Moving fast everything looks great.  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
See that man, he's all alone  
Looks so happy but he's far from home  
Ring my bell, smile at him  
Better kick over his garbage bin  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
The rain comes down but I don't care  
The wind is blowing in my hair  
Seagulls flying in the air  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
Policeman shouts but I don't see him  
They're one thing I don't believe in  
To find some charge but it's not leavin'  
  
Lift both hands, his head in disgrace  
Shines no light upon my face  
Through the darkness, we still speed  
My white bicycle and me  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle

Crying, Laughing, Loving, Lying
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
Crying, crying never did nobody no good no how  
That's why I don't cry  
That's why I don't cry  
Laughing, laughing sometimes does somebody some good somehow  
That's why I--I'm laughing now  
That's why I--I'm laughing now  
Loving, loving never did me no good no how--no how  
That's why I can't love you now  
That's why I can't love you now  
Lying, lying never did nobody no good no how--no how  
So why am I lying now?  
So why am I lying now?  
So why am I lying now?

Carbon Monoxide
Cake
----------------
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Where's the air?  
Where's the air?  
Where's the, where's the, where's the air?  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz  
Sealed away from my scents  
I'd have the music high going ninety five  
Too much too much too much too much  
  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Don't you care?  
Don't you care?  
Don't you, don't you, don't you care?  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I wasn't just a pedestrian  
Breathing all this in  
I look up at that grey sky  
It makes me want to (oh)  
Too much too much too much  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear.

Little City
Bon Jovi
----------------
J. bon jovi  
  
I got my call light on  
Gimme one more fare tonight  
Just get me over the bridge  
I can see those shiny bay lights  
You know Im never alone  
But Im feeling lonely tonight  
Damn, I got my last cigarette  
But I aint got not light  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
In my rear view mirror  
I see someone elses hairline  
I hear that fire in your eyes  
Is on the rock and doing hard time  
  
And the grapes of wrath, theyre on the vine  
Theres wine in this dirt  
Here love aint love  
Its just another four letter word  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
Now that cold gray fogs  
Just a rolling down the highway  
Hes come to carry me home  
Its put a little smile on my face

The Woman I Am
Chaka Khan
----------------
Hey sister  
I never knew which way to go  
Everybody had an answer  
So I said  
Go lecture someone, go lecture someone  
  
I could feel it in my heart babe  
I couldn't scream, I couldn't shout  
I had to find out in my own way  
Ran into someone - ran into someone  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I had to learn to trust myself  
I had to learn just when to say no  
Always trying to please someone else  
I had to let go, I had to let go  
  
The world is filled of many wonders  
I had to look to heaven for my own  
I saw the star that I was unter  
Lord lead me back home, lead me back home  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I can look at myself and I'm not afraid  
I have finally learned how to love  
I can feel everything that I've never felt  
And I'm sure now that I've always known

Rhiannon
Fleetwood Mac
----------------
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldn't you love to love her?  
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover?  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
  
She is like a cat in the dark and then  
She is the darkness  
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when  
The sky is starless  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
Will you ever win?  
  
Rhiannon  
Rhiannon  
Rhiannon  
Rhiannon  
  
She rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldn't you love to love her?  
She rules her life like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover?  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
Will you ever win?  
  
Rhiannon  
Rhiannon

Taken by  
Taken by the sky  
  
Taken by  
Taken by the sky  
  
Taken by  
Taken by the sky

Love's a state of mind  
  
Dreams unwind  
Love's a state of mind  
  
Dreams unwind  
Love's a state of mind

You Love Me To Death
Hooverphonic
----------------
Face your faith  
Remove all the lace  
You love me to death  
But death may love you more  
  
You paint with glaze  
But write me without grace  
You love me to death  
Our love was mortal hope  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But death may love you more  
  
You grow in me  
And although we disagree  
You love me to death  
You can not love me more  
  
The best things in life to find  
Will not always satisfy  
You can love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go

The Ocean Of The Sky
Used
----------------
The war is over if there was a war  
I hope we won  
A little boy waits with a lever on his own  
So I craft a ship to fly my way back home  
When the ocean of the sky swallows me whole  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
Yet I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home  
  
The hand, the slavemaster, what guessed his eye  
lie in pets  
Showed me just how closely men resemble pigs  
For the blind man that must journey into hell  
I was surprised to meet my mother there as well  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
Yet I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home  
  
I saw him flat so awkward up my hand  
Below the stars  
He Hopped in my bed we pretended to be friends  
But his sigh that could have torn this man apart  
And in his face I saw the canopy inferno  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
And I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home

My Skin Is My Sin
Ice Cube
----------------
Motherfucker, you'd better break yourself  
  
My skin is my sin, look at my complexion  
Section 8, erection great  
Balls like Ru Paul and a big fat plank  
Get you higher than a Spike Lee joint  
See I'm a chicken hawk and I'm hunting chicken and watermelon  
It ain't nothing but hard time bailing  
Just got a misdomener  
Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as Sarafina  
Get the hell out Somolia, we didn't call y'all  
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all  
Fuck Reggie Denton and Jimmy (Johnny) Cochran  
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him  
I plead guilty your honor  
Cause I dissed the Pope more times than Sinead O'Connor  
Huh huh, cool, like Butthead and Beavis  
Truer than the Mack but I'm downer than he is  
And that police chief named Willie  
Can take his motherfucking ass back to Philly  
Dropped a bomb on a crew named "Move"  
Years ago, here's a hoe  
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm Khadafi  
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy  
They want to give me ten in the pen cause I'm smelling like Hen  
My skin is my sin  
  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
  
I Get Around like Tupac, just bought a new glock  
And I want what you got  
So please give it up so I can live it up  
Just like the rich but I still eat grits  
I don't know karate  
But I can still beat the dog shit out of Nazis  
You claim you want to put in work  
Plotting to blow up a church  
See you devils are all the same  
You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name  
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep  
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep  
Lamb of God, and it's odd  
That Allah is a man that don't need a tan  
And you can't stand when I talk like that  
And why do black men have to walk like that?  
Cause we swing low like a chariot  
And now I got Harriet all on my dick  
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10  
My skin is my sin  
  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
  
Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?  
Standing like a G pissing on America's flag  
Dub C, the nigga from Westside  
Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel  
Cause uh, my skin is my sin  
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend  
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus  
I'm calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters  
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest  
And a bitch by the name of America's on it  
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers  
And the Indians took my motherfucking religion  
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?  
Like Jim Kelly said, "You try to set me up?" Shit...  
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise  
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?  
Like Pepsi, niggas got a new generation  
And we don't want your American education  
Ain't no brain washing this way  
Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK  
And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner  
Don't let me catch you on no corners  
I see you on TV talking more shit  
But just like your punk-ass ancestors, you's a bitch  
You's a bitch if I ever saw one  
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical  
And watch God show and prove  
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules  
So run devil run, you's to best start running  
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming  
And ain't no way you gon' win  
Cause I come from a tribe of O.G.'s and my skin is my sin  
  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N "Burning our black skin"  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N "Burning our black skin"

This is Christmas  
This is Christmas  
This is Christmas time  
(It's Christmas time)

Deck the halls and give a cheer  
For all the things that Christmas is each year  
  
Oh, Christmas

Lay Me Down
Sam Smith
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Yes I do, I believe  
That one day I will be where I was  
Right there, right next to you  
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark  
The moon, the stars are nothing without you  
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?  
No words can explain the way I'm missing you  
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside  
These tears, they tell their own story  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?  
And make sure you're alright  
I'll take care of you  
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm reaching out to you  
Can you hear my call?  
This hurt that I've been through  
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?  
And make sure you're alright  
I'll take care of you  
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight  
  
[Outro]  
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side  
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou

One Of Those Nights
Ufo
----------------
Guess it's just the same old story  
Fool I didn't have a chance  
She took me like a house that's burning  
Never gave a second glance  
Eat 'em up let 'em go and you never  
Let your feelings show  
She ain't here and you're asking why  
Life's a bitch and then you die  
Come on lover just let go  
  
Is there something I should know  
Was it just one of those nights  
Something you don't remember, yeah  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I don't remember  
Sitting at the bar drinking beer  
Happy hour's over and love's cost me dear  
The piano player sits at his stool  
He's playing "Feelings" ain't' life cruel  
Uptown downtown life's a river  
And I wish I could drown  
  
I could still hear those loving sighs  
A lesson learnt love's just a lie  
I know I made a big mistake  
With love there's no even break  
There's a price you have to pay  
I got the bill when I heard you say  
  
(Was it) just one of those nights (baby)  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you don't remember  
  
Was it just one of those nights, baby  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I don't remember  
  
(Was it) just one of those nights (baby)  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you don't remember

My Red Joystick
Lou Reed
----------------
The first bite of the apple made Eve smart  
The second bite taught her how to break men's hearts  
The third bite taught her how to strut her stuff  
But she never got to the fourth bite, that says :  
Enough is enough  
  
Enough is enough, I've had enough of you  
You can keep your dresses, you can keep your jewels  
You can keep the color TV, those soaps just make me sick  
All I'm asking you leave me, is my little red joystick  
  
My red joystick, my red joystick  
All I'm asking you leave me, is my little red joystick  
My red joystick, my red joystick  
All I'm asking you leave me, is my little red joystick  
  
Eve kissed Able, that's how he got murdered by Cain  
Abraham gave up his son, to keep his wife away  
And even the Load almighty, speaking from the trenches to the pits  
Spoke for all of mankind, when he said  
  
Take the Porsche, take the kids, take the stocks  
Take the rugs, take those roses from my poor heart wilting  
But, please, please, please  
  
Leave me my red joystick, leave me my red joystick  
Leave me my red joystick, leave me my red joystick  
  
Eve drank apple cider, Eve brewed good apple wine  
Eve cooked up stewed apples, knew how to have a good time  
She came into the bathroom, raised her skirts up high  
She said, 'If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, baby  
Give me a piece before I die  
  
Hey, Eve take a bite of my apple  
I know you think you're pretty slick  
The one thing I ask you to leave me is my red joystick  
  
My red joystick, my red joystick  
All I'm asking you leave me, is my little red joystick  
My red joystick, my red joystick  
All I'm asking you leave me, is my little red joystick  
My red joystick

In A World Like This
Backstreet Boys

You've got me wide open,  
Wide open, now I'm yours  
You found me heartbroken  
Heartbroken, on the floor  
Became my salvation  
Salvation through the war, yeah  
You got me wide open  
Wide open, now I'm sure

In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you

In a time like this where love comes 'round  
I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you

Dead Bodies Everywhere
Korn
----------------
Come on, step inside, and you will realize  
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be  
What's your vision?  
You'll see, what do you expect of me?  
I can't live that lie  
Hate!  
  
I sing my words, I'm fucked at dealing  
with your life's dead bodies everywhere  
You  
  
Really want me to be a good son why?  
You make me feel like no one  
Let me strip the plain, let me not give in  
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies  
Your dreams never achieved, don't lay that shit on me  
Let me live my life  
  
Hate!  
I sing my words, I'm fucked at dealing  
With your life's dead bodies everywhere  
  
You!  
Really want me to be a good son, why?  
You make me feel like no one  
You want me to be, something I can never ever be!  
I sing my words, I thought that didn't  
With your life's dead bodies everywhere  
  
You!  
Really want me to be a good son why?  
You make me feel like no one  
Dead bodies everywhere!

Santeria
Sublime
----------------
I don't practice Santeria I ain't got no crystal ball  
I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all  
I could find that Heina and that Sancho that she's found  
I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down  
  
All I really want to know  
I already know  
All I really want to say  
I can't define  
It's love that I need  
But my soul will have to wait till I get back and find  
Heina of my own  
Daddy's gonna love one and all  
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break and I got to live it out, oh
yeah  
  
I swear that I all really want to know  
All I really want to say is I got mine and I make it  
That love make it go, my soul will have to  
  
What I really want to say, ah baby  
What I really want to say, is I've got mine  
And I'll make it, yes I'm going up  
Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him  
He best go run and hide  
Daddy's got a new .45  
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat  
Believe me when I say that I got somethin' for his punk ass  
  
What I really want know, ah baby  
What I really want to say is there's just one way back  
And I'll make it, yeah, my soul will have to wait

Warriors Of The Wasteland
Frankie Goes To Hollywood
----------------
From diamond mine to the factory  
Everybody's doing what you've got to keep on doing for society  
Make this world a good place to be  
Let livin' be but don't work for free  
Playing isn't paying so work is what I'm saying  
Working for the world go round  
The battle cry don't mess with me  
I've traveled the world for eternity  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors of the wasteland  
  
It seems to me that the powers that be  
Keep themselves in splendour and security  
Armoured cars for megastars  
No streets, no bars, yours wealth is ours  
They make the masses, kiss their assets  
Lower class jackass, pay me tax take out the trash  
Working for the world go round  
Your job is gold, do as you're told  
They pay you less then run for congress  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors - what a waste, man  
I'm working for the world go round, go round  
  
Diamond mine to the factory, yeah  
Make this a world, a good place to be  
  
Warriors - what a waste, man  
  
Warriors  
  
We're rats in a cage  
  
Suicide a go go

Killing Loneliness
HIM
----------------
Memories sharp as daggers  
Pierce into the flesh of today  
The suicide of love took away all that matters  
And buried the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me  
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
I'm killing loneliness  
  
Nailed to the cross together  
As solitude begs us to stay  
Disappear with a lie forever  
And denounce the power of death over our souls and secret brings us in to
start a war  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me  
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
I'm killing loneliness  
  
Killing loneliness  
I'm killing loneliness  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me

Amy Hit The Atmosphere
Counting Crows
----------------
If I could make it rain today  
And wash away this sunny day down to the gutter  
I would  
Just to get a change of pace  
Things are getting worse but I feel a lot better  
And that's all that really matters to me  
  
Amy hit the atmosphere  
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter and  
She's never coming back, I fear  
But any time it rains,  
She just feels a lot better  
And that's all that really matters to me  
  
We've waited so long for someone to take us back home  
It just takes so long  
And meanwhile the days go drifting away  
And some of us sink like a stone  
Waiting for mothers to come  
  
There has to be a change, I'm sure  
Today was just a day fading into another  
And that can't be what a life is for  
The only thing she said was she feels a lot better  
And that's all that really matters to me

Easy Come, Easy Go
George Strait
----------------
Says she's had enough of me, I've had enough of her too.  
I might as well go on and set her free, she's already turned me loose.  
No fault, no blame, nobody done no wrong-  
That's just the way it sometimes goes.  
Sometimes two people just don't get along, it's time to hit the road.  
  
[Chorus]  
Goodbye, farewell, so long, vaya con dios.  
Good luck, wish you well, take it slow.  
Easy come girl, easy go.  
  
We tried to work it out a hundred times, ninety- nine it didn't work.  
I think it's best we put it all behind before we wind up getting hurt.  
No hard feelings darling, no regrets,  
No tears and no broken hearts.  
Call it quits, calling off all bets, it just wasn't in the cards.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easy come girl, easy go.  
Vaya con dios, good luck,  
Easy come, easy go.

Complete Control
Clash
----------------
They said release 'Remote Control'  
But we didn't want it on the label  
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"  
The people laughed but the press went mad  
  
Ooh ooh ooh someone's really smart  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, that's a laugh  
  
On the last tour my mates couldn't get in  
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again  
At every hotel we was met by the Law  
Come for the party - come to make sure!  
  
Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong?  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song  
  
They said we'd be artistically free  
When we signed that bit of paper  
They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee  
An' worry about it later  
  
Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control - lemme see your other hand!  
  
All over the news spread fast  
They're dirty, they're filthy  
They ain't gonna last!  
  
This is Joe Public speaking  
I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind  
  
Total  
See-o-n control - that means you!

Santa Song
Adam Sandler
----------------
So many presents,  
So little time,  
Santa won't be coming around my house this year,  
Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear,  
Oh mama made it perfectly clear,  
Santa don't like bad boys... Especially jewish ones.  
  
Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that I desire,  
So why did I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,  
I told him I was sorry,  
I'm a liar,  
So no toys for me... I don't deserve them.  
  
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,  
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.  
  
Dear santa,  
  
I know what my problem is, why I can't be good, it's a fear of intimacy.  
You see my whole life whenever I've met someone really great like you and  
I keep feeling like I'm getting close to them, something inside me makes  
Me want to screw it up. So in a weird way the reason I'm so bad is because  
I love you santa.  
  
Rock-em sock-em robots is what I was hoping for,  
But then I made a death threat to vice president gore,  
Oh santa won't be knocking on my door,  
Cause he's a big fat whore... What made me say that?  
  
Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed,  
So why'd I have to sell that cop a bag of weed,  
So santa please give me that easy bake oven,  
I swear I thought billy goats we're made for lovin'.  
  
So santa won't you accept my apologies,  
Santa can't you see I'm begging you please,  
Oh santa next year I'll do you right,  
Live from new york it's saturday night...

Everybody Knows
Cliff Richard
----------------
Everybody needs to cry some  
Everybody can't be wise  
Everybody needs some understanding  
Understanding when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
Anyone who's ever hurt you  
Anyone who's ever tried  
Will only love you then desert you  
Won't believe you when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
(guitar solo)  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
Everybody needs to cry some  
Everybody can't be wise  
Everybody needs some understanding  
Understanding when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end like this

Lullaby
Wang Chung
----------------
Let's go out tonight  
Put on your shoes  
Get away from here  
Far from the local blues  
Let's go out tonight  
Let's make our escape  
From the city lights  
And all the familiar shapes  
We can drive all night  
We can stop in a field  
Hear the starlight  
Traveling for millions of years  
Sing a lullaby to the night (repeat)  
We can rock and roll  
We can dance all night long  
To the stars above  
And we won't be strong  
We can walk away  
To the rising dawn  
As people go to work  
Wondering why our clothes are torn  
Sing a lullaby to the night (repeat)  
We'll be driving through the mountains  
In the cool and clearing air  
With the sunlight on the ocean  
And the diamonds in your hair  
And as you're falling asleep  
I will sing you a lullaby  
Sing your lullaby (repeat)  
We can find a place  
For the sun and the rain  
We can live a life  
Like a hurricane  
On a mountain top  
Or right by the sea  
As long as we're together  
It don't matter to me  
Let's go out tonight  
Let's escape  
Sing your lullaby (repeat)  
As the perfumes of the evening  
Mingle sweetly with the night  
We'll lay ourselves down  
In the light of the moon  
And we'll hold each other tight  
And as you're falling asleep  
I will sing you a lullaby

Better Days (Basteroid 'Dance Is Gone' Vocal Mix)
Depeche Mode
----------------
What are you hiding from?  
You are part of the sum  
What has been going on?  
Your confidence has gone  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways  
What are you waiting for?  
Answers that question more  
Uninvited they will come  
Are you expecting some?  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways  
Only time will tell  
What will come of you  
Only crime could sell  
What you're trying to  
Where are you heading to?  
What plans will you pull through?  
With trouble in the wings  
Will you risk anything?  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways

Without You
Ingrid Michaelson
----------------
I did what I did for you I did what I could  
I did what I don't know how  
You did what you did for you you did what you would  
I don't know I don't know now  
  
My life will grow my love will go  
My life will go, my love will grow  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
  
Everything moves save for me everything will move  
I just don't know how to know  
But somebody will make me fall somebody will try  
Then I will just go and go  
  
My life will grow my love will go  
My life will go, my love will grow  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Go, go, go, just go go go  
Go, go, go, just go go go  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you

Traveling
Utada Hikaru
----------------
Uh, Uh, Come on, yea!  
Huh, Ohh, Mmm Mmmm  
Wha'ch doin' tonight, Let's go for a ride!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
  
I'm a workaholic even on  
Friday afternoons  
Snatchin' up a taxi is easy, (and I jump right in)?  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The taxi driver looks to me and says "Where to?"  
Oh, just kinda over there  
?The bad economy's a problem (closing)  
Please watch out for the door?  
  
Riding on the wind, Climbing up to the moon  
My place is here? right next to you  
The problem is it's hard to go home  
Admist the dreamy spring night  
  
Traveling, with you  
Traveling, onward  
Lighting up the asphalt (?In the asphalt, blazing up a trail?)  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you going?  
To anywhere far  
  
Traveling, beyond  
Traveling, get down (?shake it?)  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up  
Even though we're not in a hurry  
  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
  
There's a song and I want to sing it  
Over and over again  
So I can spur my feelings on until they won't stop  
That's the plan  
  
Partying with the waves, Thanking the clouds  
I finally met you  
Because we're young  
Nothing more than dust blowing in the wind  
  
Traveling, our hearts  
Traveling, press closer  
Now and forever let's abandon the usual  
Traveling, this place is  
Traveling, shabby  
Our destination is not here.  
  
Traveling, Your window  
Traveling, open it  
There's nothing to fear  
Traveling, here  
Traveling, all is well  
Everything we've got is in our hearts  
  
This is the time to dance and have fun  
Don't hold it back tonight  
The hidden wishes in your heart are gonna hurt you  
Put up your hands and have some fun!  
And why does  
Some wariness remain  
  
Traveling, with you  
Traveling, still  
In the asphalt, blazing a trail  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you?  
The good times are about to begin  
  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, shake it  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up  
I don't want to stop  
  
Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?  
I would like to.  
Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?  
Ohhao oa oooh ohh whoa oh ohhoa (Traaaaaveling)  
Oh woa ohoa oha ohhh (Ohhhhhhh Traaaaveling)??  
Don't stop now, Don't stop now, Don't stop now, oooh whoa?

I'm Your Kind Of Guy
Neil Young
----------------
Baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.  
  
I said, baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.  
  
I'll send you flowers  
Every day girl,  
If you will promise to be mine,  
Forever more.  
And if you say  
The words I long to hear,  
You know how happy I'll be.  
  
So baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.

How Do Ya'll Know
Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
Standin' on top of my hill  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
How can you tell me to make my bed  
When I sleep on the ground  
How can you say that you like my noise  
When I haven't made a sound  
I like peace time better than war  
Spendin' my money in the candy store  
I like makin' angels on the shore  
How do ya'll know  
  
Floatin' on my cloud  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
Yellin your sermon from the bottom of a glass  
'Cause you know how it's done  
Tellin' me the troubles of the promised land  
When I'm in it just for fun  
I like to eat my pie before my meal  
Make a snake with an orange peel  
Say my prayers before I kneel  
How do ya'll know  
  
When I was walkin' past your house  
I didn't see nobody home  
Ya'll musta been out buyin' gold  
When I was polishin' chrome  
Ridin' in my spaceship  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
What makes you think you can navigate  
When you don't know where I'm flyin  
Tellin' me the facts about what I say  
When you don't even know if I'm lyin'  
  
I like to wear white in the wintertime  
Pay my penance before the crime  
Have my reason without the rhyme  
But how do ya'll know

Winter Wonderland
Andy Williams
----------------
Sleigh bells ring  
are you listening  
in the lane  
snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
we're happy tonight  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
as we go along  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
we'll say: No man  
But you can do the job  
when you're in town  
  
Later on  
we'll conspire  
as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
the plans that we've made  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
and pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
until the all the kids knock him down  
  
When it snows  
ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
the Eskimo way  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
walking in a winter wonderland

Nobody's Home
Deep Purple
----------------
Nothing I can do about it  
Maybe I won't even try  
Your will is determined to kill any  
Reason of mine  
  
I see you coming  
With that look in your eye  
You act like a king but you ain't got a thing  
In your mind  
  
And now there's nobody home  
My belly is aching  
Your image is blown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home  
  
You talk about love and affection  
If only you could  
You're full of pride but there's nothing inside  
And you think you're so good  
  
You know you got it coming to ya  
All things return  
You need me  
It's not gonna be my concern  
  
And now there's nobody home  
Your message is changing  
The children have grown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home  
  
I hear you crying  
What can I say  
You get what you give so  
Forgive me as I turn away  
  
Nobody's home  
A legend is dying  
The seeds have been sown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home

Gunga Din
Jim Croce
----------------
You may talk of gin and beer  
When you're stationed way out here  
An' you're sent to penny fights an' Aldershot it  
But when it comes to slaughter  
You will do your work for water  
An' you'll lick the boots of 'I'm that's got it  
Now in Inja's sunny clime  
Where I used to spend my time  
Servin' her Majesty the Queen  
Of all the black faced crew  
The finest man I knew  
Was regimental bhisti, Gunga Din  
  
The uniform he wore  
Was nothin' much before  
An' rather less than half of that behind  
But a piece of twisty rag  
An' a goatskin water bag  
Was all the field equipment he could find  
  
When a sweatin' troop train lay  
In a sidin' through the day  
Where the heat would make you bloomin' eyebrows crawl  
We shouted, "Harry By"  
Till our throats were bricky-dry  
Then wopped him 'cause he couldn't serve us all  
He would dot an' carry one  
Till the longest day was done  
An' never seemed to know the use of fear  
If we charged or broke or cut  
You could bet your bloomin' nut  
He'd be waitin' fifty paces right flank rear  
With his mussick on his back  
He would skip to our attack  
An' watch us till the bugles made"Retire"  
An' for all his dirty hide  
He was white, clear white inside  
When he went to tend the wounded under fire  
  
It was Din, Din, Din  
With the bullets kickin' dust spots on the green  
And when the cartridges ran out  
You could hear the front files shout  
Send ammunition mules, and Gunga Din!  
I shan't forget the night  
When I fell behind the fight  
With a bullet where my belt plate should a' been  
I was chokin' mad with thirst  
An' the man that spied me first  
Was our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din  
He lifted up my head  
An' he plugged me where I bled  
An' he gave me half a pint of water green  
It was crawlin' and it stunk  
But of all the drinks I've drunk  
I'm most grateful to the one from Gunga Din  
  
He carried me away  
To where a dooli lay  
An' a bullet came and drilled the beggar clean  
He carried me inside  
An' just before he died  
I hope you like your drink said Gunga Din  
So I'll meet him later on  
In the place where he as gone  
Where it's always double drill and no canteen  
He'll be squattin' on the coals  
Givin' drink to poor damn souls  
I'll catch a swig in hell from Gunga Din  
  
It was Din, Din, Din  
You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din  
Tho' I've belted you an' flayed you  
By the livin' God that made you  
Your a better man than I am, Gunga Din

Blow Wind Blow
Eric Clapton
----------------
When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
I don't know where she was  
I know she's out with some another guy  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
But don't your house look lonesome  
When your baby's packed to leave?  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Well you know if I don't soon find her, I will be in misery  
Goodbye baby that is all I have left to say  
Ohh, goodbye baby, that is all I have left to say  
But you have lost your good thing  
Go ahead and have your own way

I Sacrificed More Than You'll Ever Lose
Reba Mcentire
----------------
I fed the children  
And I kissed them goodnight  
You fed the jukebox  
Till they turn out the lights  
I bought the bacon  
While you bought the booze  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
  
Needing new clothes with the money you spent  
On barbills and motels and women you met  
But I stood the heartache that you put me through  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
  
I gave up so much  
And now I'm giving up you  
It's too late to make up for  
The love that you used  
  
I've had enough  
I don't want you around  
Don't look at me  
Like I let you down  
You say I'm to blame  
But who's fooling who  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
Yeah I sacrificed more than you'll ever lose

Let's Get Stoned
Ray Charles
----------------
Let's go get stoned, let's go get stoned  
When your baby won't let you in  
Got a few pennies, a bottle of gin  
Just call your buddy on the telephone  
Let's go get stoned  
  
Let's go get stoned, let's go get stoned  
When you work so hard all the day long  
And every thing you do seems to go wrong  
Just drop by my place on your way home  
Let's go get stoned  
  
It ain't no harm, you're taking just a taste  
But don't blow your cool and start messing up the place  
It ain't no harm you're faking just a nip  
But make sure you don't fall down bust your lip  
Let's go get stoned, let's go get stoned

From The Bottle To The Bottom
Kris Kristofferson
----------------
You ask me if I'm happy now  
That's good as any joke I've heard  
It seems that since I've seen you last  
I done forgot the meaning of the words  
If happiness is empty rooms  
And drinkin' in the afternoon  
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clam  
But if it's got a thing to do  
With smilin' of forgettin' you  
Well I don't guess that I could say I am  
  
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone  
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew  
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper  
He's been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from comin' through  
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants  
Because he's never seen a single dream come true  
That's the way that I've been feelin' since the day I started falling  
  
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool  
Learnin' hard to live with losin' you  
You wonder if I'm better off  
With freedom now to do the things I choose  
With all my times my own and  
I got nothin' left but sleepin' time to lose  
There's no one here to carry on  
If I stay out the whole night long  
or give a tankerous damn if I don't call  
I'm livin' like I wanted to  
And doin' things I want to do  
And nothin' means a thing to me at all  
  
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone  
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew  
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper  
He's been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from comin' through  
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants  
Because he's never seen a single dream come true  
That's the way that I've been feelin' since the day I started falling  
  
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone  
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew  
When the water from the weeds soaked the paper  
He's been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from comin' through  
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants  
Because he's never seen a single dream come true  
That's the way that I've been feelin' since the day I started falling  
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool  
Learnin' hard to live with losin' you

Lobster Quadrille
Carly Simon
----------------
Lobster quadrille  
With lucy simon  
Writer lewis caroll  
  
"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. "There's a
porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the
lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle - will
you come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will
you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join
the dance? "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they
take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea! " But the snail
replied "Too far, too far! " and gave a look askance - Said he thanked the
whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would
not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not,
could not, could not join the dance. "What matters it how far we go? " his
scaly friend replied. "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France - Then turn not pale,
beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
won't you join the dance? "

I'm Only Out For One Thang
Ice Cube
----------------
Well two bees in a bucket  
Mother mother fuck it  
You either Flavor Flav it  
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it  
Kiss my ass or suck a D.I.C.  
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me  
I fucked that lady in the bed  
I missed that pussy and I bust a spread  
I tried it again in a thumping wagon  
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging  
Tried it again and I failed to grasp  
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass  
Then I fucked this lady in the tree  
The baby came out and said "Run-DMC"  
  
I knew this girl who looked just like you  
Light brown and a fly hair-do  
I wanted to do her, screw her  
So I stepped to her  
On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey  
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over  
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over  
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night  
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe  
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me  
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be  
I guess I just wine her and dine her  
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her  
Waxing that ass like Rain Dance  
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her  
Took her to the Comfort Inn  
Tucked her in  
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in  
She said will you call me  
Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya  
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same  
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thing

The Light Is Always Green
Housemartins
----------------
We dig our models with the brains the size of models  
And cars that we can trust with out wives  
And we dig converstations with girls from every nation  
But not the ones that whisper or tell lies  
Wherever there's a will there's a motorway  
Wherever there is greed there is speed  
And they've always got to be there for yesterday  
Welcome to the new scalextric's breed  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean  
We're only flying past so we dig our sevice fast  
From the waiters to the women to the wine  
Never mind the match, I've an urgent date to catch  
Get me to the concert hall on time  
Pretending to be pilots in a war  
Pretending to weave between the flak  
No-one knows what the mission's for  
Blinkered horses on the track  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean

I'd Say You
Reba Mcentire
----------------
If I had to say what love feels like  
I'd say you  
If I had to say what love tastes like  
I'd say you  
If I had to show what love looks like  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you  
  
If someone asked what heaven is  
I'd say you  
If I describe what pleasure is  
I'd say you  
If I had to show what a dream looks like  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you  
  
In Webster's book  
I'd even add a word or two  
Under perfect lover  
I'd put see you  
  
If I had to show my biggest thrill  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you  
  
I'd say you  
I'd say you  
  
If I had to show what love looks like  
That's an easy thing to do  
I'd pick your favorite colors  
And honey I'd paint you

Fancy Colours
Chicago
----------------
Going where the orange sun has never died  
And your swirling marble eyes shine  
Laughing  
Burning blue the light  
Bittersweet the drops of life  
Memories only fading  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever did see  
When we're down at the sea  
We see things so very clear at the sea  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever can do  
The morning covered with dew  
We do things so very fine in the dew  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever do hear  
But whether we're here or there  
We hear things so very fine when we're there

The Time Of The Turning
Peter Gabriel
----------------
In the big house  
Where the sun lives  
With the walls so white and blue  
In the red soil  
All the green grows  
And the winds blow across your face  
They blow across your heart  
  
It's the time of the turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
All the earth breaks  
Like a stale bread  
And the seeds are folded in the soil  
Oh the sun pours  
Then the rains fall  
While the roots reach out right through the ground  
They reach out through the ground  
  
It's the time of turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and the old world's falling  
Nothing you can do can stop the next emerging  
Time of the turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
If we can stand up  
When all else falls down  
We'll last through the winter  
We'll last through the storms  
We'll last through the north winds  
That bring down the ice and snow  
We'll last through the long nights  
Till the green field's growing again  
Growing again

I Forgive You
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
  
'Cause the lights are on  
But I'm never home  
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude  
'Cause I forgive you  
  
[Chorus]  
I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
I forgive you  
We were busy living the dream  
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
  
I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now do I start to feel again  
If I hate you, what does that do  
So I breathe in and I count to 10  
  
'Cause the lights are on  
And I'm coming home  
Yes I am back  
With a new heart in my hand  
'Cause I forgive you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I forgive you  
For every time that I cried  
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me  
That's alright, yeah I forgive you  
  
I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
  
[Chorus]

Beautiful Eyes
Taylor Swift
----------------
Your beautiful eyes  
Stare right into my eyes  
And sometimes I think of you late at night  
I don't know why  
I want to be somewhere where you are  
I wanna be where  
  
[Chorus]  
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine  
So baby, make me fly  
My heart has never felt this way before  
I'm looking through your  
I'm looking through your eyes  
  
I wake up, I'm alive  
In only a little while, I cry  
'Cause you're my lullaby  
So baby hold me tight cause I-I  
I want to be everything you need  
I want to be where,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as long as you're mine  
I'll be you're everything tonight  
Let me love you, kiss you  
Oh baby let me miss you  
Let me see your  
Dream about  
Dream about  
Dream about your eyes  
Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes

My World
Guns N' Roses
----------------
You wan'da step into my world  
It's a sociopsychotic state of bliss  
You've been delayed in the real world  
How many times have you hit and missed?  
Your cat-scan shows disfiguration  
I want to laugh myself to death  
With a misfired synapse  
With a bent configuration  
I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath  
You want to talk to me  
So talk to me  
You want to talk to me (7x)  
You can't talk to me  
You don't understand your sex  
You ain't been mindfucked yet  
  
Let's do it (3x)  
Oh my distorted smile  
  
Guess what I'm doing now

Model Citizen
Warren Zevon
----------------
Don't bring the milk in  
Leave it on the porch  
Don't read the papers  
Don't mow the lawn no more  
Drive to the market  
At the break of dawn  
Watch 'em unload the produce  
Then ride right back home  
  
[CHORUS]  
It's the white man's burden  
And it weighs a ton  
I'm a family man  
Model citizen  
Tormen the mailman  
Terrorize the maid  
Try to teach 'em some manners  
Whip 'em into shape  
Down in the basement  
I've got a Craftsman lathe  
Show it to the children  
When they misbehave  
  
[CHORUS]  
I'm a law-abiding man  
I'm a good Samaritan  
I pay my taxes when I can  
Model citizen  
In the cool of the evening  
When the sun goes down  
My wife's playing canasta  
With everyone in town  
When I feel the pressure  
And I need a break  
Load up the Winnebago  
Drive it in the lake  
  
[CHORUS]

I Want To Tell You
The Beatles
----------------
I want to tell you  
My head is filled with things to say  
When you're here  
All those words they seem to slip away  
  
When I get near you  
The games begin to drag me down  
It's all right  
I'll make you maybe next time around  
  
But if I seem to act unkind  
It's only me, it's not my mind  
That is confusing things  
I want to tell you  
I feel hung up and I don't know why  
I don't mind  
I could wait forever, I've got time  
  
Sometimes I wish I knew you well  
Then I could speak my mind and tell  
Maybe you'd understand  
  
I want to tell you  
I feel hung up and I don't know why  
I don't mind  
I could wait forever, I've got time  
I've got time  
I've got time

Be Careful
R. Kelly
----------------
2 years ago, promises is all I heard, wait a minute, let me finish  
2 years ago, promises is all I heard, out of your mouth  
Now you wanna walk away boy, and tear down the walls in this house  
You used to tell me sweet things, sweet things in the morning time  
Now all you do is hurt me, and think that everything is fine  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
Now who was there for you, when your ass was out of work  
All by myself, taking little man to church  
So quick to hang up the phone, when I step, in the room  
Then you want to turn it all around, I'm gettin tired of playing fool  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)  
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)  
  
2 years ago, didn't know you had male friends, wait a minute, let me finish  
2 years ago, didn't know you had male friends, off up in college  
I found out you're still reaching out to some of them, Mrs. Busy Body  
You used to listen to me, when you were down and lost  
But now, you don't even respect me, ever since I got laid off  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
Now who gave you money, when your ass was broke, without a doubt  
And even though lil' man is not my child, I made him mine, hm-hm  
So quick to run to your friends, and talk about, what we do in this house  
And then you wanna party all night long, what the hell you talking 'bout  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
If the shoe fits, wear it girl (Yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)  
If the shoe fits, wear it girl (Yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)

Died And Came Back
Young Buck
----------------
If I should die before I wake  
Lord please...my soul to take  
Man I ain't even ask for this shit...  
there's no way I can hide it  
You see the pain in my eyes  
I ain't thinkin bout college  
Too busy tryin to stay alive  
They done cut the water off  
And I ain't trying to the lights go  
Even little shit like 5 dollars I'ma fight for  
My sisters only 12 and she's pregnant wit a baby  
My brothers goin' ta jail and my momma's going crazy  
I'm all by myself, muthafuck my ol' lady  
???'Cause soon tha money left, she was fucking niggas daily???  
We already in hell, Lord, please will you save me  
I'm riding with a 12 gauge I know these niggas hate me  
I got a few birds and a few words for you niggas on the streets  
I'm swirving in excursions I know you heard of me  
I got em mad at me I hit the block top drop that nigga bad ain't he  
We sell rocks plus glocks and keep our rags hanging  
Thug niggas shooting at cops  
Look we ain't playing, anywhere, setting up shop  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
There's gotta be somebody that who can come and explain that  
I know  
You got the ak bitches in the hood  
These snitches in the hood  
My suggestion to you nigga start getting it while its good  
If you crawl for your ball learn the game know the things that will get you
knocked off  
'Cause niggas out here ain't playin  
???Being real done popped off???  
???Two pills in this home got me way in new york???  
Bout to run up in your home and I'm way up your floor  
My money and I'm gone, if he paid me on time, then we wouldn't have to shoot
em  
But they got a place for him like they got a place for me  
Maybe we'll meet again, we'll just have to wait and see  
Thug niggas, I love killin, so cock it back and bust  
Remember me, I used to smoke weed on the school bus  
Nigga wha? nigga who? nigga wotcha won do?  
I'm young buck, now move? and let me come through  
Is it true before you die do you really see it coming Do the hardest nigga
crying start running?  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
There's gotta be somebody who can come and explain that  
I know  
Politicians is bullshitting  
And really bill clinton is the closest we gettin to ever havin a black
president  
Still I feel heaven sent and try to walk with my head up  
'Cause now we got this anthrax shit to be scared of  
Nobody prepared us for this  
All they said was "make sure you watch the news at six"  
And we feeding all these other countries  
What about that old man eating out of the fuckin dumpster?  
Oh you don't know him but everything that goes up must come down  
One look, and all the projects that they got go down  
I'm rydin' with god  
???Me and my squad nigga, you get beat???  
Now we ballin but remember how it used to be  
So regardless, don't let nothing come between our family our money our dreams  
And even when it seems like its all over from Tennessee to the Magnolia  
We gonna ball till we faulter  
I wonder if I died and came back  
Would god still let a nigga sit here and slang crack  
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat  
There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that  
I know

Rev On The Red Line
Foreigner
----------------
Two in a row, everybody knows  
At the green light you rev it on the red line  
Been waitin' all week to get my wheels on the street  
Get my hands on the wheel, slide down in the seat  
  
She's wearin' new colors and runnin' pretty good  
I got four hundred horses tucked under the hood  
But there's no need to panic, it's under control  
We're aerodynamic and ready to roll  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Rev on the red line  
Just let it go  
  
Runnin' all night on lake avenue  
It's a piece of cake  
If you know what to do  
You've got to lose a few  
'Til the stakes get high  
When the odds are right  
You just blow by  
  
And make no mistake, there's women who just wait  
For the man and machine with the best time  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Feels like a lifetime  
But soon you'll know  
  
Wasn't long ago I could've lost my wheels  
Had to outrun the law, it was no big deal  
I guess they had a grudge, they were hot on my tracks  
I had to pay off the judge to get my license back  
Now I need to pin those needles, got to feel that heat  
Hear my motor screamin' while I'm tearin' up the street  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Rev on the red line  
Just let it go  
  
Rev on, rev on  
Rev on, rev on  
  
Don't think I'll ever learn to slow down  
Rev on, you'll still be here and I'll be gone  
Rev on, rev on

Works like a magnet on the people all around

Anybody loving music up in your town

Love it when they hear the champion sound  
Need it when they hear the champion: Watch out!  
  
We've made tragedy, ripped up sporadically and [Repeat x4]  
  
Gimme ride at the party with the bump full of Pearl [Repeat x3]

In the crowd screaming:Yo, that's Lateef! Moron!

Rally round it if you're strong  
Throw your arms to the moon, c'mon

This Is Not Your Life
Train
----------------
I don't understand you,  
The way you disappear,  
You don't understand me,  
The way I keep us here.  
  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own,  
This is not your life.  
  
We were only children,  
But you knew the game,  
And you were busy feeling,  
That someone had to take the blame.  
  
But I know how you're really,  
When no one's around,  
We were only children,  
Looking to be found.  
  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own.  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own.  
This is not your life...  
  
Even after the fall,  
No one ever seemed to care,  
And now you come back to call,  
And you want me to be here.  
  
I know how to do it on my own,  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own,  
This is not your life,  
And I know how to do it on my own,  
And this is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own,  
And this is not your life,

Open
Demi Lovato
----------------
Spitting fire back and forth now  
Times have changed in just a few months  
Neighbors complaining from the fights and  
Why can't things be the same  
  
And maybe I'm just a little bit cautious  
Of what I'm gonna say  
When I tell you I can't live this way.  
But I don't know what to expect from someone who's so insane  
  
Why can't I get through the night  
Without another fight  
I'm tired of the hurting  
Is it really worth it?  
Am I all alone again?  
Cause I am kinda feeling like I'm screaming  
With my mouth shut  
When it's really open.  
  
The only noises in my head  
Are consumed of your voice  
From all the pain and hatred  
How long can you kick somebody down  
Before a foot breaks?  
  
And why can't I get through the night  
Without another fight  
I'm tired of the hurting  
Is it really worth it?  
Am I all alone again cause  
I am kinda feeling like I'm screaming  
With my mouth shut when it's really open.  
  
And I knew that you would fabricate  
This situation just for  
The sake of your need for attention  
And I'm sick of always being the one  
To always break down, always melt down  
In the end.  
And maybe this time  
It's a sign that independance and I  
Are finally catching on  
I don't need you to rely on.  
  
And why can't I get through the night  
Without another fight I'm tired of the hurting  
Is it really worth it?  
Am I all alone again cause  
I am kinda feeling like I'm screaming  
With my mouth shut  
When it's really open.  
Spitting fire back and forth now  
Times have changed in just a few months.

Love Deadly Love
Ufo
----------------
A greyhound bus weaves its way across town  
I'm sitting here thinking  
Never thought I could be brought down  
And low yes I'm sinking  
  
Bet on a wild one, I got stitched  
Caught up in a fight  
I was dreaming, dreaming, oh I saw you last night  
(I got a) 4 by 8 on Riker's Yard  
8 to 15 I'm doin' hard  
For you and your lover  
  
Shot through the head  
Air conditioning lead  
The honeymoon was over  
With the telephone bill  
  
Yes you've been tumbled  
With your fingers in the till  
The Chelsea Hotel with a private line  
Now it's payback time  
  
Sha la la la I can't let you go  
It's not over till it's over, no  
Sha la la la I can't set you free  
Oh no can't let go  
'Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Through the shadows of my backyard  
Now brother I'm leaving a calling card  
This mission tonight  
Feels so right Mr. D.O.A.  
Some they can take it and some lie down  
Some just wear that thorny crown  
Like a halo round the head  
Oh now you're better off dead  
  
Sha la la la I can't let you go  
It's not over till it's over, no  
Sha la la la I can't set you free  
Oh no can't let go  
'Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Sha la la la I can't let you go  
It's not over till it's over, no  
Sha la la la I can't set you free  
Oh no can't let go  
'Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
There's a visit and one phone call  
And sometimes a stroll  
If I'm straight in five years  
Maybe remission or parole  
  
Bet on a wild one, I got stitched  
Caught up in a fight  
I was dreaming, dreaming, oh I saw you last night  
(I got a) 4 by 8 on Riker's Yard  
8 to 15 I'm doin' hard  
For you and your lover  
  
Five card stud that's your game  
I'll cut stack and lose it's all the same  
You could never say no never say no no no no  
Love deadly love, love deadly love  
Love deadly love, love deadly love  
Love deadly love, love deadly love

Right Back
Sublime
----------------
Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
Your girlfriend said so but I don't really know  
That don't mean we fucked around that night last week when you left town  
  
I was tweakin' by myself one night that's when I wrote this tune  
Didn't have no need for that bed in my hotel room  
Sometimes right now since I've left the pen  
I feel like I'm right back there again  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from  
  
Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
My girlfriend said so, she's a little ho  
That don't mean I fuck around, I like to keep that higher ground  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from  
Don't tease me, don't tease me, don't tease  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from

What child is this  
That lay to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping  
Whom Angels greet with anthem sweet  
And shepard's watch are keeping

So bring him incence, gold and merth  
Come peasants king to honor him  
The King of Kings salvation brings  
And loving arms enthrone him

Strong men tremble when they hear it!  
They've got cause enough to fear it!  
  
It's much blacker than they smear it!  
Nobody mentions...  
My name!  
  
Rich men hold their five-pound notes out --  
Saves me emptying their coats out.  
They know I could tear their throats out  
Just to live up to...  
My name!  
  
Wiv me  
Jemmy in me hand,  
Lemme see the man who dares  
Stop me.  
Taking what I may  
He can start to say his prayers!  
  
Biceps like an iron girder,  
Fit for doing of a murder,  
If I just so much as heard a  
Bloke even whisper...  
(spoken) My name! Bill Sikes...  
  
(sung) Some Toff, slumming wiv his valet,  
Bumped into me in the alley  
Now is eyes'll never tally  
He'd never heard of...  
My name!  
  
One bloke  
Used to boast the claim  
He could take my name in vain...  
Poor bloke...  
Shame 'e was so green  
Never was 'e seen again!  
  
Once bad -- What's the good of turning?  
In hell, I'll be there-a-burning  
Meanwhile, thing of what I'm earning  
All on account of...  
My name!  
  
What is it? What is it? What is it?

Baker Street
Foo Fighters
----------------
Winding you way down to baker street  
Light in your head and dead on your feet  
Well another crazy day  
You'll drink the night away  
And forget about everything  
  
This city's dance makes you feel so cold  
Its got so many people but its got no soul  
And its taken you so long  
To find out you were wrong  
When you thought it had everything  
  
You used to think that it was so easy  
You used to say that it was so easy  
But you're trying, you're trying now  
  
Another year and then you'll be happy  
Just one more year and then you'll be happy  
But you're crying you're crying now  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
Opens the door  
He's got that look on his face  
And he asks you were you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about everything  
  
He's got this dream about buying some land  
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands  
And then he'll settle down  
In some quiet little town  
And forget about everything  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
You know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone  
  
When you wake up its a new morning  
The sun is shining its a new morning  
You're going, your going' home

Angels Running
Cher
----------------
Well I heard enough  
And I've seen enough  
And I know enough to know  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
  
Well I've been around  
I've been up and down  
Until I bailed out of control  
With your world all in motion  
Gonna put a ball  
And chain on your soul  
  
All those angels running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting hearts together  
Broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
  
We'll always be lovers  
With borders of there own  
And you may charge across  
In a golden chariot  
But you will never be at home  
  
'Cause I had dreams  
Like distant thunder  
I had hope like a prayer unheard  
This nothing less than perfect  
In a less than perfect world  
  
All those angles running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting back together  
Hearts broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
It's a bad thing to let go  
It's a bad thing

Stand Up
Indigo Girls
----------------
There's love in the corners  
and love down the straight highway  
there's danger in the outskirts of town  
and in what you don't say  
you're either sinking or thinking  
the dark's your romance  
or a special one's shining a light on a chance  
that it's all very worthy to ache  
in the middle of the night  
  
Sometimes I can't sleep  
I can't keep all these feelings at bay  
I am rage, I am sorrow and grief  
all alone in my way  
I know humor and heartbreak  
and people are life  
if I keep my eyes closed  
i'll be open to strife  
because the powers that be send their love  
in the middle of the night  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.  
  
To my mother my father  
my witnesses live in my jagged heart  
that for years has been running like fire  
as though that was its part  
from lover to cover and ocean to sky  
from desert to mountain and promise to lie  
I can say that I've prayed to forgiveness  
in the middle of the night  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.  
  
Now I can see love in the woman  
And love in the man in myself  
I see how most people just ache to be good  
at expressing themselves  
and I wish I could tell you just right what I mean  
about the light shining down, if I'd only come clean  
but for now I live with myself  
in the middle of the night.  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.

Baby
Iggy Pop
----------------
Baby, don't you cry  
Baby, I'll sing you a lullaby  
  
We're walking down the  
Street of chance  
Where the chance is always  
Slim or none  
And the intentions unjust  
  
Baby there's nothing to see  
I've already been  
Down the street of chance  
  
Baby you're so clean  
Baby please stay clean  
Baby you're so young  
Baby please stay young  
Baby, don't you cry  
Baby, we've already cried  
We want some we want some  
All aboard for fun time  
Fun  
Baby baby we like your lips  
Fun  
Baby baby we like your pants  
All aboard for fun time

Well, I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head  
Over you, over you  
I want you to want me I need you so badly

Hollies

Did you ever see a man with no heart  
Baby, that was me  
Just a lonely, lonely man with no heart  
Til you set me free  
  
Now I can breathe

Good Sign
Status Quo
----------------
Nice to see  
Nice to see you, I've been feeling so blue  
Owning up now 'cause you change my point of view  
It's funny how you do what you do  
It's a very good sign, a really good line for you  
I've been waiting for the heat of the night  
Warming up now and you've got me in your sights  
So tell me what you want me to do  
It's a very good time to tell you I've been thinking of you  
Because you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life  
Let me tell you, you're a woman with style  
I've been waiting, but you made it all worthwhile  
And all you had to do was to smile  
You're a very good sign and everything's fine, my child  
'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life, ooh  
Set in my ways I live from day to day happy to be free, hey  
Needing for nothing, always looking for someone who could make me see  
But baby, I was so wrong, I sat here waiting too long  
To have you here with me, oh  
'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life  
'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life, oh  
Oh, it's a very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign

502
Megadeth
----------------
"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops!"  
Full tank, pockets lined with cash  
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.  
Drive all day and through the night,  
Romance the road, winding left to right.  
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free.  
A feeling inside me and the whole world to see.  
Driving fast makes me feel good,  
The speed of light trapped under my hood.  
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.  
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.  
Hundreds of miles rolled off today.  
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away.  
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all.  
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol.  
Drive until daybreak, always on the go.  
Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol.  
Driving fast makes me feel good,  
The speed of light trapped under my hood.  
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.  
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.  
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you.  
Stars above guide me  
This feeling inside me  
I drive until daybreak.  
Life on the freeway is Hell.  
I'm coming through

Summer Romance
Supertramp
----------------
In the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her and he asked her to dance  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
  
My heart was beating with a rage like thunder  
And when I saw him, I began to wonder  
I could see the old love light in his eyes  
See the love light in his eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
How's your new love, babe?  
  
Well, in the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her, he said, 'Please, give me another chance'  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
Yes, it did, it did, it did  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
Took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?

Never Get Over You
George Harrison
----------------
I know I'll never get over you  
So deep this feeling that I have for you  
Your eyes pierce through my heart  
Your smile tears me apart  
I knew it, it's so true  
I'll never get over you  
  
You touch me making my heart race  
So much was written on your face  
I knew when you arrived  
That no words could describe  
What your love made me do  
I'll never get over you  
  
Girl, you're so much heart and soul  
Girl, was a moonlit night you came into my life  
And now this feeling has grown  
And if you leave me alone I know  
I'll never get over you  
  
So hide the moments when I feel blue  
You warm the coldest feet  
Can cool me in the heart  
And all though love was new  
I'll never get over you  
My understanding grew  
But I'll never get over, never get over you

Something To Believe In
Hank Williams Jr.
----------------
There ain't too much chance for opportunity  
In this town that I live in  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do with me  
And it's getting hard to contend  
With the fact that I ain't going nowhere  
If I don't get out of here  
I need a change of luck and a pick-me-up  
Something more than the bars and the beers  
  
I need something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
Cause I got a bad case of the blues  
Something to believe in  
Something to make me feel right  
Something to believe in  
Is that asking too much out of life  
  
Well I quit my job  
And I'm leaving today  
Cause two hundred a week, it don't make it  
I got a ticket going to L.A.  
And I'm hoping I can take it  
Cause I got enough money for about a month before I'll be back on the bus  
But I got faith in me and all new things I see  
I just need a little good luck  
  
Well I was getting down  
Soon I'd have to leave town  
And I was out walking the street  
When I met a girl  
By the burger world  
And I was needing her company  
By the way she was dressed  
I knew what to expect  
When we got to her motel room  
Ah, but when she found out I came from her hometown  
She starting crying and Lord I did too  
  
I need something to believe in  
Ah, baby something to look forward to  
Ah, do you feel like I do  
Something to believe in  
She said please stay with me tonight  
I want something to believe in  
Just talk to me and hold me tight  
  
She was just eighteen  
And I couldn't believe  
What had happen since she left home  
I thought I had some pains  
But it wasn't the same  
As the hell she had known  
So we packed our stuff  
And we got on the bus  
And now it's back to the same old grind  
But if you could have seen  
The way she looked at me  
When she saw the city limit sign  
  
We got something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
And I believe in me and you  
Something to believe in  
Holding each other tight  
Something to believe in  
That special something called being in love to get us by

Are You The One?
Scorpions
----------------
Another rainy morning  
People rushing by  
My head is still in the clouds  
I dream with open eyes  
Suddenly out of nowhere  
She came into my life  
Like we know each other  
For quite a while  
  
In the sound of silence  
Time is standing still  
There's some kind of bond between us  
That's givin' me the chill  
Do you really wonder  
That we can burn the sky  
It's written a thousand years ago  
In the book of life  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's always in my dreams  
The one who keeps me goin'  
When I can't go on  
The one that I've been waiting for  
For so long  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
Suddenly out of nowhere  
She came into my life  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's always in my dreams  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's mine eternally  
The one who keeps me dreamin'  
When I'm sad and tired  
Who gives my life a meaning  
'Til the day I die  
  
Are you the one  
Are you the one

Where Are You Christmas
Faith Hill
----------------
Where are you Christmas?  
Why can't I find you?  
Why have you gone away?  
  
Where is the laughter,  
You used to bring me?  
Why can't I hear music play?  
  
My world is changing  
I'm rearranging  
Does that mean Christmas changes too?  
  
Where are you Christmas?  
Do you remember,  
The one you used to know?  
  
I'm not the same one  
See what the time has done  
Is that why you have let me go?  
  
Christmas is here, everywhere  
Oh, oh  
Christmas is here, if you care  
Oh  
  
If there is love in your heart and your mind  
You will feel like Christmas all the time  
Oh  
  
I feel you Christmas  
I know I found you  
You never fade away  
Oh  
  
The joy of Christmas  
Stays here inside us  
Fills each and every heart  
With love  
  
Where are you Christmas?  
Fill your heart with love

Heart Like A Wheel
Black Sabbath
----------------
In these days of confusion  
You've turned angry and cold  
You say it's an illusion  
There's no fire in your soul  
  
Say you don't love me  
Say you don't care  
But don't leave me standing here  
Your heart's like a wheel  
  
Just waiting to roll  
It's longing for freedom  
To get out on the road  
You're hungry for something  
  
That you may never find  
So many reasons  
Your love has made you blind  
You say you don't love me  
  
You say you don't care  
So don't leave me standing here  
Don't leave me standing here  
You say you don't love me  
  
You say you don't care  
Don't leave me  
Don't leave me standing here  
Life ain't been easy  
  
Full of passion and pain  
Told me no reason  
Why I was to blame  
Don't leave me standing  
  
Don't leave me standing  
Don't leave me standing  
On my own

Back Door Man
Ufo
----------------
I'm every man here in disguise  
Lie cheat and give you a spoonful of lies  
I'm a high toned mother with an axe to grind  
Come a little closer honey, see what you find  
Your worst nightmares all rolled in one  
I'll find you sure as the rising sun  
Don't make a noise it's understood  
'Cause this ain't no story like red riding hood  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man oh yeah  
I'm your back door man, come on babe  
And I'll take you where I can  
Systematically I choose at will  
But with you there's an obscene thrill  
It's funny now how you can't say no  
It's the smell of fear that you love so  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man, oh yeah,  
I'm your back door man baby, Just take it where you can  
This first kiss has a touch of ice  
Now how's that feel, it ain't so nice  
Blackhearted mamma I've something new  
Oh Lord look what I've turned into  
  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man

The Thought Of You
Eurythmics
----------------
Maybe I should go to bed  
Maybe I'm the glutton for the truth  
You've got me standing on my head  
Trying to put on someone else's shoes  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive  
  
I promise you a miracle  
I promise you everything he is  
Please don't get hysterical  
Can't you see I'm trying to take the piss  
  
But-  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain on mine alive  
  
You float around inside my head  
Going from one extreme to the other  
But words like these should go unsaid  
So I'll keep y big mouth shut forever  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive  
  
The thought of you  
Is enough to make a million angels sing  
The thought of you  
Make the bells of hell go ting a ling a ling

Dani California
Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
Getting born in the state of Mississippi  
Papa was a copper, and mama was a hippie  
In Alabama she would swing a hammer  
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama  
She never knew that there was anything more than all  
What in the world does your compliment take me for?  
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana  
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana  
She's a runner  
Rebel, and a stunner  
On her merry way sayin "Baby, watcha gonna?"  
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five  
Just another way to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
California, rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California, show your teeth  
She's my priestess  
I'm your priest  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
She's a lover  
Baby, and a fighter  
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter  
With a name like "Dani California"  
Tje day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya  
A little loaded,she was stealin' another breath  
I love my baby to death...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who knew the other side of you?  
Who knew that others died to prove?  
Too true to say goodbye to you  
Too true to say, say, say  
  
Pushed the fader  
Gifted animator  
One for the now  
And eleven for the later  
Never made it up to Minnesota  
North Dakota man  
Was a gunnin' for the quota  
Down in the Badlands she was savin' the best for last  
It only hurts when I laugh  
Gone to fast  
  
[Chorus x2]

Please Come Home
Uncle Kracker
----------------
[Spoken:] it must have been about 100 years... at least 100 years... I wish
you could come back- just come back home.  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago  
And I'm still waiting with my hand right by the telephone.  
Yeah maybe where you are you cannot make that call  
Or you can't find a pen, I know its not your fault.  
My friends think I'm insane cause I've turned old and gray  
And I'm still waiting and I cannot be alone.  
Please come home  
Please come home.  
I watch the clock hands tick, my hours turn to days.  
And I can't fall asleep cause I don't want to miss that ring.  
I know that this year that your car will park outside,  
But I can't put my arms around the girl who took my life.  
My friends think I'm insane cause I've turned old and gray  
And I'm still waiting and I cannot be alone.  
Please come home  
Oooh baby,please come home.  
[Spoken:] its been so long, its been about 100 years and a million dreams
since the last time I saw your pretty face.  
I would do whatever it takes.  
I would wait another hundred years, and if that didn't work, maybe i would try
and see what forever feels like. but until then, and I Know you hear me, and
whatever your doin, wherever you are, please come home.  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago,  
And I'm still waiting for you  
Baby Baby, won't you please come home.  
Please come home.  
Won't you please come home.  
Please come home

All I Ask Of You
Josh Groban
----------------
No more talk of darkness  
Forget these wide-eyed fears  
I'm here, nothing can harm you  
My words will warm and calm you  
  
Let me be your freedom  
Let daylight dry your tears  
I'm here, with you, beside you  
To guard you and to guide you  
  
Say you'll love me every waking moment  
Turn my head with talk of summer time  
Say you need me with you now and always  
Promise me that all you say is true  
That's all I ask of you  
  
Let me be your shelter  
Let me be your light  
You're safe, no one will find you  
Your fears are far behind you  
  
All I want is freedom  
A world with no more night  
And you, always beside me  
To hold me and to hide me  
  
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Let me lead you from your solitude  
Say you need me with you here, beside you  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Christine, that's all I ask of you  
  
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
  
Share each day with me, each night, each morning  
  
Say you love me  
  
You know I do  
  
Love me, that's all I ask of you.  
  
Anywhere you go, let me go too  
Love me, that's all I ask of you  
  
I gave you my music, made your song take wing.  
And now, how you've repaid me, denied me and betrayed me.  
He was bound to love you, when he heard you sing.  
Christine, Christine.  
  
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime  
Say the word and I will follow you  
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...  
  
You will curse the day you did not do!  
All that the Phantom asked of you!

Am I Reaching You Now
Train
----------------
Would you believe me  
If I said My head is spinning without you  
Would you believe me  
If I just want to let you know how I feel about you  
  
Now I want to know what I can do to make you stay with me tonight  
'Cause I do  
Would you believe me if I leave you, cause here I go  
  
Am I reaching you now  
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm letting you go  
Am I reaching you now  
Dearly departed now that you've started, I'm going to finish it  
  
Would you believe me  
If I held on too tight to make it without you  
Would you believe me  
If I just gotta let you know I cant live without you  
Would you believe me if I leave you cause here I go  
  
Am I reaching you now  
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm letting you go  
Am I reaching you now  
Dearly departed, now that you've started it, I'm going to finish it  
  
Now I don't mean to test your faith  
Or make you think that I wont wait for you  
'Cause I will  
But baby this is all I got  
So I'm gonna give it one last shot  
I would give you more than enough  
But baby I got to let go  
Let you go  
  
Would you believe me  
Am I reaching you now  
I was trying to tell you I was letting you go  
Am I reaching you now  
Dearly departed, now that you've started, I'm going to finish it  
  
(am I reaching you now)  
Gotta finish it  
Gotta finish it  
Dearly departed, now that you've started, I'm gonna finish it

There's
Proclaimers
----------------
There's your coat upon my back.  
There's the irony I lacked.  
There's the vapor from your mouth.  
There's the rain spreading from the south.  
  
There's the castle on the hill.  
There's my final act of will.  
There's a bus stop in Tollcross.  
There's no memory I've lost.  
Memories never lost.  
  
There's you lying on the quilt.  
There's your west of Scotland lilt,  
Singing me your guilt.  
  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
  
There's the snow in January.  
There's the beauty that you see.  
There's you walking down the street,  
Children running 'round your feet.  
There's you and there's me.

Caveman Love
Horrible Histories
----------------
I'm just a lonely cavegirl  
Searching for a date  
Looking for cave romance  
Or at least a caveman date  
  
My momma says I must wait here  
Until the moon is bright  
With cakes, milk and honey as gifts for the Gods  
Or as snack food for Mr. Right  
  
Now crawl around three times  
On your hands and knees  
And if the face of a handsome man comes into view  
Then he's your caveman love  
  
I think I must look really silly  
What caveman in his right mind would go for a crawling, circling cavegirl  
Like -  
Oh, are you the man for me?  
  
My handsome caveman husband  
Is all I'd hoped he would be  
He likes to go out hunting  
Then I cook it for his tea  
  
I promise to love him forever  
Until he's old and grey  
He'll live to the grand age of thirty  
At which point he'll probably pass away  
  
But that doesn't mean you stop loving him  
'Cause now you have to prepare  
A burial to show how much you care  
For your caveman love  
  
First I set fire to my husband  
Then carefully cut off his skin  
Boil in a pot some oysters and snakes  
Let the funeral begin  
Drop in some limpets and winkles  
And sprinkles of mouse, toad and shrew  
Then put out the fire with the cauldron  
And say au revoir to my caveman love  
My caveman love  
Caveman love.

Riding across the desert on a fine Arab charger

Forgive My Heart
Nat King Cole
----------------
Forgive my heart  
My foolish heart it won't believe we're through  
Forgive my heart  
You're still a part of everything I do  
Forgive my lips  
If now and then  
They speak your name  
If you are still  
My only thrill  
Am I to blame  
  
Forgive my dreams  
In all my dreams it seems your face appears  
Forgive my eyes  
I realize I'm only wasting tears  
Don't know why you haunt me  
But you do  
Forgive my heart  
I'm still in love with you

You Love Me
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
Thick skin, soft touch,  
Heart of gold but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
Forgiving arms, the higher road,  
Working hard but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
You say, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
But what you really mean is, you're not good enough, you're not good enough  
You can't deliver  
So you turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You said you loved me but that I  
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
  
Stronghold, but fun ride,  
But roller coasters aren't just na-na-na-not enough,  
I keep it in, you wear me out,  
This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough,  
Said I'm just a sinking ship, I'm just a sinking ship,  
But what that really means, is you can't handle this, you can't handle this,  
You couldn't win so you turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love feels different it's like a blow to the head with your compliments.  
Your love hurts deeper  
It's like a brick in the sea and I'm drowning with it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So understand it means nothing when you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
You love me, you love me  
  
You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You know the truth is that  
You're not good enough, you're not good enough

Silver Dollar Forger
Nazareth
----------------
Swingin' my sweet chariot low  
Gotta make it home to georgia  
Excise lawman on my trail  
I'm a silver dollar forger  
I see a road block on my right  
Engine take me through the night  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.  
  
Twenty miles from that Georgia state  
I can hear the sirens wailing  
If only I can cross that line  
And leave the police trailing  
I see a red light at my rear  
Now I'm sweatin' cold steel fear  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.  
  
I'm tired of all this running  
Hiding from the light  
I want to walk out in the sun  
  
I'll soon be home I can see the clay  
I'll soon be in Atlanta  
If only I can hold that line  
I can live just how I want to  
I see the state line in my lights  
Engine take me through the night  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.

I was walking on the avenue  
(Strolling)  
The heart opened to the unknown  
I wanted to say hello to anyone  
Anyone and that was you, I told you anything  
Just hadda talk to you, to tame you  
(Win over)  
  
On the Champs Elysees, on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun, under the rain, at midday or midnight  
There's whatever you want on the Champs Elysees  
  
You said I have rendezvous in a basement  
(Underground)  
With mad guys who live with guitar in the hand  
(Crazy)  
From evening til' morning  
  
So, I've accompanied you  
(Came with you)  
We sang, we danced  
And we even not thought about kissin'  
(Embracin')  
  
On the Champs Elysees, on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun, under the rain, at midday or midnight  
There's whatever you want on the Champs Elysees

In The Sea
America
----------------
In the sea the fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night on wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars sail serenely by  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Go, go and ask the magpie  
Where do unicorns go  
  
In the trees the birds have learned to speak  
Gaily colored they keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds playing hide and seek  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Does myth and mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go

Glo-glo-glo-gloria  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plain  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  
Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis Deo  
Oh, no, yeah yeah  
  
Shepards, why this jubilee  
Why your joyous song prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be, ohh  
That inspire your heavenly song  
Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis Deo  
Oh oh oh, ooh oh, oh yeah  
  
Oh, come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing, oh  
Come on adore on bended knee  
Christ, the Lord, our new-born King  
Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis Deo, oh yeah

On the day, that Christ was born  
The angels sang such a heavenly song  
In excelsis Deo, oh

Angels we have heard on high  
Angels we have heard on high

Blue Prelude
Nina Simone
----------------
Let me sigh, let me cry when I'm blue,  
Let me go away from this lonely town,  
Won't be long till my sun will be blue,  
Cause I know I'm on my last go round.  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow,  
Wouldn't heal all the pain in my soul.  
  
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow,  
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal,  
Here I go, now you know why I'm leaving.  
Got the blues. What can I lose? Goodbye!  
  
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow,  
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal,  
Here I go, now you know why I'm leaving.  
I got the blues. What can I lose? Goodbye

Pick Up The Bones
Alice Cooper
----------------
Collecting pieces of my family in an old pillow case  
This one has a skull but it don't have a face  
These look like the arms of father so strong  
And the ring on this finger means my Grandma is gone  
  
Here's some legs in a cloud where my sister once played  
Here's some mud made of blood and these teeth are decayed  
The ear of my brother, The hand of a friend  
And I just can't put them back together again  
  
Pick up the bones and set them on fire  
Follow the smoke going higher and higher  
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight  
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light  
  
There are stains on the floor where kitchen once stood  
There are ribs on the fire place mixed with the wood  
There are forces in the air, ghosts in the wind  
Some bullets in the back and some scars on the skin  
  
There were demons with guns who marched through this place  
Killing everything that breathed, they're an inhuman race  
There are holes in the walls, bloody hair on the bricks  
And the smell of this hell is making me sick  
  
Pick up the bones and set them on fire  
Follow the smoke going higher and higher  
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight  
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light  
  
Pick up the bones and set them on fire  
Follow the scope going higher and higher  
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight  
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light  
  
Now maybe someday the suns gonna shine  
Flowers will bloom and all will be fine  
But nothing'll grow on this burnt cursed ground  
'Cause the breathe of the death is the only sound

Taxman
Lucky Dube
----------------
I pay my gardener to clean up my garden  
I pay my doctor to check out da other ting  
I pay my lawyer to fight for my rights  
And I pay my bodyguard to guard my body  
There's only one man I pay  
But I don't know what I'm paying for  
I'm talking about the taxman  
I'm talking about the taxman  
I'm talking about the taxman  
  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman  
  
You take from the rich, take from the poor  
You even take from me, can't understand it now  
I pay for the police to, err...I don't know why  
'Cause if my dollar was good enough  
There wouldn't be so much crime in the streets  
They tell me you're a fat man  
And you always take and never give  
  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman

Nothing Ever Goes As Planned
Styx
----------------
Written by Dennis DeYoung  
Lead Vocals by Dennis DeYoung  
  
What'cha going to do when the sun goes down tonight  
You'll hit the same old clubs, rap that same old trash  
That's right  
You've got them real silk shirts and them baggy pants  
Dago shoes in the colors that match  
But the girls are acting bored  
And you're feeling like you're going to lose  
You've got the G.Q. Blues  
  
You get up every morning and you go to work each day  
(you go to work, you go to work, you go to work)  
Been doing the same damn job for ten long years this May  
(you've got to work, you've got to work, you've got to work)  
You've been working and saving for your Jamaican dream  
Paradise is waiting across the sea  
But when your plane lands Montego turns to Monsoon  
You've got the Island Blues  
  
'Cause, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
You're so together and you act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong you're still surprised  
You've done your duty, you've paid a fortune in dues  
Still got those Mother Nature's Blues  
  
I strut around the stage like a little king tonight  
They'll scream for every word and every note, that's right  
But when the show is over and I'm all alone  
Can't reach my baby on the telephone  
And everywhere I look Mr. Loneliness is in the news  
I've got the Big Star Blues  
  
Boy, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
I'm so together and I act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong  
I'm still surprised  
I've done my duty and paid a fortune in dues  
Still got them Mother Nature's Blues

About the man above  
There's too much talking trash  
And not enough love

Healing Rain
Michael W. Smith
----------------
Healing rain is coming down  
It's coming nearer to this old town.  
Rich and poor, weak and strong  
It's bringing mercy, it won't be long.  
Healing rain is coming down  
It's coming closer to the lost and found.  
Tears of joy and tears of shame  
Are washed forever in Jesus' name.  
  
[Chorus]  
Healing rain, it comes with fire  
So let it fall and take us higher.  
Healing rain, I'm not afraid  
To be washed in Heaven's rain.  
  
Lift your heads, let us return  
To the mercy seat where time began.  
And in your eyes I see the pain.  
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain.  
And only you, the son of man  
Can take a leper and let him stand.  
So lift your hands, they can be held  
By someone greater, the Great I Am.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Healing rain is falling down,  
Healing rain is falling down,  
I'm not afraid.  
I'm not afraid.

Baby, It's Cold Outside
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
I really can't stay  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
I got to go away  
But baby, it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry?  
And father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
But baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink?  
No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break the spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
  
I ought to say no, no, no, Sir  
Mind if I move in closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride?  
I really can't stay  
Oh, baby don't hold out, baby  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
I simply must go  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been  
How lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Gosh, your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh, your lips are delicious  
Well, maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to get home  
But, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see  
How can you do this thing to me?  
  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Think of my life long sorrow  
At least there will plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay  
Get over that old out, baby  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Where could you be going  
When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?  
Baby, it's cold, cold outside

Fake
Korn
----------------
I can't stand the sight of you  
I can't stand what you put me through  
Your life's a lie that you hide  
Is it that terrible being you inside?  
I can't stand, oh, the thought of you  
I can't stand all the things you do  
What do you try to justify?  
  
You are just too scared to be you inside  
Let it all go  
I look at you  
All I see is a man too afraid to really be  
I can't stand what you put me through  
I can't stand even the thought of you  
Your secret lies that you hide  
Is it that terrible being you inside?  
Let it all go  
  
You try so hard to be wanted  
False emotions tells you fronted  
I think being a person relies on one thing  
  
Be yourself, let you come through  
You're too afraid to really be  
Someone who isn't false and doesn't care to be  
Be yourself, let you come through!  
Fake!

Don't Make Me Over
Neil Diamond
----------------
Don't make me over  
Now that I can't  
Make it without you  
Don't make me over  
I wouldn't change  
One thing about you  
  
Don't pick on the things  
I say,  
The things I do  
Just love me with all my faults,  
The way that I love you  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
Now that I'd do anything for you  
Don't make me over  
Now that you know how I adore you  
  
Just take me inside your arms  
And hold me tight  
And always be by my side,  
If I am wrong or right  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
Don't make me over  
Now that you've got me  
At your command  
  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
  
Just take me inside your arms  
And hold me tight  
And always be by my side,  
Even if I am wrong or right  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
No, don't make me over  
Now that  
You've got me at your command  
  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
Accept me for what I am babe  
Accept me for the things I do  
  
Don't make me over  
Don't make me over  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do

Flight 505
Rolling Stones
----------------
Well, I was happy here at home  
I got everything I need.  
Happy bein' on my own  
Just living the life I lead.  
  
Well, suddenly it dawned on me  
That this was not my life.  
So I just phoned the airline girl  
And said, "Get me on flight number 505,  
Get me on flight number 505."  
  
Well, I confirmed my reservation.  
Then I hopped a cab.  
No idea of my destination  
And feeling pretty bad.  
  
With my suitcase in my hand.  
In my head, my new life.  
So then I told the airline girl  
"Well, get me on flight number 505,  
Get me on flight number 505."  
Alright.  
  
Well, I sat right there in my seat.  
Well, feeling like a king.  
With the whole world right at my feet.  
"Of course I'll have a drink!"  
  
Well, suddenly I saw  
That we never ever would arrive.  
He put the plane down in the sea.  
The end of flight number 505.  
The end of flight number 505.  
Alright.  
  
Whew, they put the plane down in the sea.  
The end of flight number 505.  
The end of flight number 505.

C'est La Vie
UB40
----------------
A woman came and said to me  
She'd seen a lady sell her baby  
For ten or twenty dollars maybe  
And everybody thinks she's crazy  
They're too blind to see  
She never failed to call attention  
To the things we never ment  
Real horror, daily, courtesy of your T-V  
C'est La Vie  
  
A woman came and said to me  
Now listen very carefully  
There's brother killing brother  
People living on their knees  
Biting sugar coated bullets  
For the pain of this disease  
C'est La Vie  
  
A woman came and said to me  
She had a husband on an island  
Found his body on a wasteland  
Soldiers came and took him  
Just to torture her you see  
C'est la vie  
All alone she mourned her lover  
Crossed the sea to find a brother  
Maybe he could help her get her baby back for free  
More stuff

Catfish
Bob Dylan
----------------
Lazy stadium night  
Catfish on the mound.  
"Strike three," the umpire said,  
Batter have to go back and sit down.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm  
But the old man wouldn't pay  
So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An' one day he just ran away.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Come up where the Yankees are,  
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,  
Smoke a custom-made cigar,  
Wear an alligator boot.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Carolina born and bred,  
Love to hunt the little quail.  
Got a hundred-acre spread,  
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Reggie Jackson at the plate  
Seein' nothin' but the curve,  
Swing too early or too late  
Got to eat what Catfish serve.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Even Billy Martin grins  
When the Fish is in the game.  
Every season twenty wins  
Gonna make the Hall of Fame.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

Can't Help Wondering Why
Nick Drake
----------------
I could have done better things  
If someone shut my mouth  
Or somebody clipped my wings  
So many wasted evenings  
Talking the same sweet talk  
Always the last ones leaving  
Waking up when fortunes knock  
  
I've no regrets no I couldn't think of one  
We both kept the road  
The road that we stumbled on  
You and me walking home  
Fighting the morning light  
Just making our way through days  
But making out like thieves at night  
  
I can't help wondering  
Can't help wondering why  
I can't help wondering  
Can't help wondering why  
  
Sometimes you wake up screaming  
All my life I must be dreaming  
I've been wrong  
And I'm not strong  
But I'll be the one that keeps rolling on  
  
Born to this generation  
Never made to wait  
Looking like fools sometimes  
A couple of blind men at the gate  
  
I can't help wondering  
Can't help wondering why  
I can't help wondering  
Can't help wondering why

Champion
Kanye West
----------------
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?  
You don't see just how fly my style is?  
I don't see why I need a stylist  
When I shop so much I can speak Italian  
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids  
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects  
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit  
My Dad'll say "when you see clothes close ya eyelids"  
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son  
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones  
'Cause every summer he'll get some  
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from  
And I don't know what he did for dough  
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'  
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'  
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion  
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'  
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?  
I guess me if it isn't you  
Last week I paid a visit to the institute  
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school  
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do  
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle  
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems  
Like I dropped out of P.E.  
They used to feel invisible  
Now they know they invincible  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
This is the story of a champion  
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns  
Stand up stand up! Here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
This is the story of a champion  
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns  
Stand up stand up! Here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib

Aspirin Damage
Alice Cooper
----------------
I get these killer headaches  
I get one everyday  
I wake up with a migraine  
Since you ran away  
  
Got a load of tension  
Burnin up my neck  
Something is wrong with my suspension  
So pass those tablets to this wreck  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
No one told me bout Aspirin damage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
Rom the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
I balance my Excedrin  
And Anacins in stacks  
I'm a pain reliever junkie  
I got a Bayer on my back  
  
I went to see the doctor  
He walked me down the hall  
Said "Strip down 'til you're naked  
Your suit, your tie and all."  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage, my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage, my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah

His Eye Is On The Sparrow
Alabama
----------------
Why should I feel discouraged?  
And why should the shadows come?  
And why should my heart be lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When Jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is He  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I am free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
Let not your heart be troubled  
His tender word I hear  
And resting on His goodness  
I lose my doubts and fears  
  
Though by the path He leads us  
But one step I may see  
His eye is on the sparrows  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
And I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me

You shot the doors but I'm right behind  
Where shadows remain  
  
I promisse I'll still be there  
To Say I promisse  
I'll still be there  
  
Don't ask me why we'll be like brothers  
Skating on the ice of mortall loneliness  
  
Live and Learn with your mind  
Find a way out of madness  
You dream on (of) paradise  
Who's gonna take you there

Unwritten Christmas
Unwritten Law
----------------
[Unwritten Law]  
Remember when, I was ten,  
Lookin forward to Christmas again,  
Everything, I enjoy,  
Like the family Christmas tree and the toys,  
And I?d wake up early morning  
While mom and dad still snored in bed,  
So I crept, down the steps,  
Couldn't wait to see what Santa had left now  
  
[Chorus]  
I could not wait for Christmas day,  
Wait for Christmas day now  
  
[Unwritten Law]  
Don't want to wait, gettin late,  
March up stairs to give my parents a shake,  
Get out of bed, sleepy heads,  
Christmas doesn't start till you are awake,  
As we gather around the tree  
I open everything they gave to me,  
So I stay, end up late,  
Why can't it be Christmas everyday now  
  
[Chorus]  
I could not wait for Christmas day,  
Wait for Christmas day now,  
But I, but I, will have to wait for Christmas,  
I will hafta wait for Christmas,  
I will always wait for Christmas day  
  
[Sum 41]  
Now wake up Christmas morning, guess what I saw,  
It's Unwritten Law and Sum 41 rock it raw,  
With the message for kids sayin they should be nice  
Not naughty 'cause, Santa knows karate, he's on the cross Vader,  
Hip hop hoorayder , got wade on the beats,  
Like AC Slater, if you good like Wally,  
Or bad like the Beev, only Santa know the score  
Come Christmas eve  
  
[Chorus]  
But I, but I will have to wait for Christmas,  
I will have to wait for Christmas,  
I will always wait for Christmas  
Day now yeah, I could not wait for Christmas day.

If I Had A Boat
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
If I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
If I were Roy Rogers  
I'd sure enough be single  
I couldn't bring myself to marrying old Dale  
It'd just be me and trigger  
We'd go riding through them movies  
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
The mystery masked man was smart  
He got himself a Tonto  
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free  
But Tonto he was smarter  
And one day said kemo sabe  
Kiss my ass I bought a boat  
I'm going out to sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
And if I were like lightning  
I wouldn't need no sneakers  
I'd come and go wherever I would please  
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree  
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole  
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat

She's Got The Answer
Air Supply
----------------
She's the kind of girl, that you need to touch  
Follow through the fire  
She can take it all, always gives so much  
And laughs 'til she cries  
  
If she's far away I can feel her still  
Soothing my soul  
When she's here with me and I'm not myself  
She takes control  
  
She's got direction, she's got devotion  
She got the rhythm, such an emotional woman  
She's got the movement  
She's got the power  
In comes the sunlight when all the flowers unfold  
I know  
  
She's got the answer - she's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
  
I am here for you, you are near to me  
A mother or a child  
Generations passing through you  
Awake in the wild  
  
She's got direction, she's got devotion  
She got the rhythm, such an emotional woman  
She's got the movement, she's got the power  
In comes the sunlight, when all the flowers unfold  
I know  
  
She's got the answer - she's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
  
She's got direction, she's got devotion  
She got the rhythm, such an emotional woman  
She's got the movement, she's got the power  
In comes the sunlight, when all the flowers unfold  
She's got the answer - she's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
She's got the answer

What You Get Is What You See
Tina Turner
----------------
Some boys got the look of a Greek Adonis  
Some boys try to talk you off your feet  
Some boys think they're gods gift to woman  
Some boys think they're sweet enough to eat  
Try to change the habit of a lifetime  
Don't even try  
Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing  
You realize  
  
What you get is what you see  
Ain't nothing more to it  
And if you want to love a woman like me  
It takes a man to do it  
If what you get is what you see  
Then I don't want your kind of love  
  
Some guys got lips that you can't help kissing  
And some guys got a smile you can't resist  
Some guys gotta build a reputation  
They just want to add you to the list  
You got a lot of physical attraction  
I can't deny  
But can you guarantee me satisfaction  
While I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
What you get is what you see  
Ain't nothing more to it  
And if you want to love a woman like me  
It takes a man to do it  
If what you get is what you see  
Then I don't want your kind of love  
  
So let me see your cards on the table  
Before I buy  
I always read the writing on the label  
So give me reason to believe there's more to you than meets the eye

Honey Pie
Barbra Streisand
----------------
She was a working girl  
North of England way  
Now she's in the big time...in the USA  
And if she could hear him, this is what he'd say  
Honey pie, you are making me crazy  
I'm in love but I'm lazy  
So won't ya please come home  
Oh honey pie, my position is tragic  
Come and show me that magic of your Hollywood song  
You became a legend on the silver screen  
And now the thought of meeting you makes me weak in the knees  
Tee tee tee  
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic  
Sail across the Atlantic to be where you belong  
Honey pie come back to me  
Oh wa wa wa...... wa wa wa wa wa wa wa... wa wa wa  
Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa  
I like it like this (laughing)  
Woo  
I like this...  
What kinda music (laughing)  
What kinda music, play it to me... play it to me  
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea  
Kindly send her sailing back to me? tee hee hee  
Oh honey pie you are making me crazy  
I'm in love but I'm lazy  
So won't ya please come home  
Come..come back to me honey pie  
Do do do do da da da dum  
Now don't get fresh fellas  
De da de do da dumb  
Honey pie come back...  
Soon...

Little Bit Of Love
Free
----------------
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Well in my mind  
It's easy  
To lose sight of the truth  
But in my heart  
I can't deny  
My feeling inside  
  
'Cause I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Man in the sky  
You say you are flying  
To lose sight of the world  
You want to stay high  
Then don't deny  
Your feeling inside  
  
'Cause I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Yeah!  
Whoo!  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh!  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Whooo  
Has gotta come your way.

Far More
R. Kelly
----------------
Mansions, hill and acres  
Women, drinks and caterers  
I would toast until the break of dawn  
Swimming pools and strippers  
Conversation six figures  
Never crossed my mind to call home.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a note on the bathroom mirror  
Telling me that you've had enough.  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far more  
  
Than this planet to me  
Than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl you're all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
Hanging out with friends  
Never calling to check in  
Neglecting you in every way  
Taking the home front for granted  
What was straight, is now slanted  
And I don't know what to do about this letter.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far More  
  
More than this planet to me  
More than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl you're all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far more  
  
Ever since you've been gone  
I realize girl just what it is I had at home  
Oh Baby, you mean far more  
Than this planet to me  
Than this air I breath  
Nothing can compare to your love for me.  
To your love for me  
To your love for me  
To your love for me

Figured You Out
Nickelback
----------------
I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt that's on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me  
You're like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I love the places that we go  
And I love the people that you know  
And I love the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row  
I love the powder on your nose  
  
Ouh, and now I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And now I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
I like the freckles on your chest  
And I like the way you like me best  
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test  
  
I like the white stains on your dress  
And I love the way you pass the check  
And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)  
  
And I love your lack of self respect  
While you're passed out on the deck  
I love my hands around your neck  
  
Ouh and I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
Why not before, you never tried  
Gone for good, and this is it  
  
I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt that's on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me  
You're like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I hate the places that we go  
And I hate the people that you know  
And I hate the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row  
I hate the powder on your nose  
  
Ouh and now I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And now I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
Why not before, you never tried  
Gone for good, and this is it  
Ooh

Everybody Hates Me
Tim McGraw
----------------
Well Joe got a promotion  
He's up there on top  
Everybody was cheerin' him on  
He deserves everything he's got  
  
Guess who's the new talk of the town  
The new S.O.B.  
The one everybody loves cuttin' down  
Man it's a sight to see  
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy  
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place  
Where everybody hates me  
  
(Now check this out)  
  
Well Bill got a promotion  
He knocked Joe back down  
Now Joe's everybody's long lost friend (laugh)  
He's back in the crowd  
  
Guess who's the new talk of the town  
The new S.O.B.  
The one everybody loves cuttin' down  
Man it's a sight to see  
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy  
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place  
Where everybody hates me  
  
Well everybody wants to be the big dog  
Want to wag that big dog tail  
But 'til they are they want to see the big dog fail  
  
You pay your dues and you get your breaks  
Then your the S.O.B.  
The one everybody loves to hate  
It just comes naturally  
They all smile right to your face, and hide the jealousy  
That's just the way it goes and I can't wait  
'Til everybody hates me

Holy Water
Madonna
----------------
I can give you everything that you want  
You can't buy this in a luxury store  
There's aplace you have to go  
Before I let you take it all  
It's like a drug  
It should be illegal  
  
Baby you should get down low  
And drink my precious alcohol  
You look so thirsty  
I think you need it  
  
Kiss it  
Kiss it back  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it back  
Make it wet  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it better  
Kiss it better  
  
I can teach all the things you don't know  
It's rare like making something you wanna own  
Bitch get out my poem  
Bitch get out my poem  
  
There's something you got to hear  
It's secret and immaculate  
I can let you in Heaven's door  
I promise you it's not a sin  
Find salvation right within  
We can do it here on the floor  
  
Kiss it  
Kiss it back  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it back  
Make it wet  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it better  
Kiss it better  
  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?

The Cage
HIM
----------------
For years I've seen you fighting  
Against your heart  
Living like you're dying  
So far from the sun  
  
Waiting for a guardian angel  
To lead you through the dangers  
That lie ahead on your way  
Towards tomorrows arms  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage  
  
We all have our fears but yours are  
The scariest of them all  
Lift your head and let us taste  
The horror you adore  
  
And it all starts to makes sense  
All the blood wisely shed  
Just wait until the cure comes knocking on your door  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage you're locked in  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage you've locked yourself in

Walk Of Shame
P!nk
----------------
One step, two steps,  
Counting tiles on the floor  
Three steps, four steps,  
Guess this means that I'm a whore  
Uh-oh,  
Hell no,  
How long 'til I reach the door?  
Fuck me,  
My feet are sore  
  
I'm wearing last night's dress and I look like a hot ass mess  
Although my hair looks good 'cause I haven't slept yet!  
  
Make the elevator come a little faster  
I'm pushing all the buttons, but nothing's happening  
Please God don't let anybody see me  
Please God I'll do anything you ask of me  
I promise, no more walks of shame  
  
So walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
Walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
  
Last night's bubblegum,  
No more bubbles, no more yum  
Where'd I get the wristband,  
Tell me there's no tramp stamp  
One two three shoot,  
No I know that shit ain't cute  
But damn the man it sure is fun,  
To party 'til the sun wakes up  
  
Okay now raise two hands if you've ever been guilty  
And clap clap clap clap clap it out if you've walked with me  
  
Make the elevator come a little faster  
I'm pushing all the buttons, but nothing's happening  
Please God don't let anybody see me  
Please God I'll do anything you ask of me  
I promise, no more walks of shame  
  
So walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
Walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
  
I shouldn't have let 'em take my keys, take my keys  
They left me here  
With too much beer.  
My friends, they hung me out to dry.  
It's not my fault, and that's why  
I'm doin' the walk of shame  
  
Make the elevator come a little faster  
I'm pushing all the buttons, but nothing's happening  
Please God don't let anybody see me  
Please God I'll do anything you ask of me  
I promise, no more walks of shame  
  
So walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
Walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
  
So walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)  
Walk this way (we're walking, we're walking)

Bleeding Me
Metallica
----------------
I'm digging my way  
I'm digging my way to something  
I'm digging my way to something better  
  
I'm pushing to stay  
I'm pushing to stay with something  
I'm pushing to stay with something better  
  
I'm sowing the seeds  
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken  
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted  
  
This thorn in my side  
This thorn in my side is from the tree  
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted  
  
It tears me and I bleed  
And I bleed  
  
Caught under wheels' roll  
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me  
Can't stop to save my soul  
I take the leash that's leading me  
I'm bleeding me  
I can't take it  
Caught under wheels' roll  
The bleeding of me  
Of me  
The bleeding of me  
  
I am the beast that feeds the feast  
I am the blood, I am release  
  
Come make me pure  
Bleed me a cure  
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under  
  
Caught under wheels' roll  
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me  
Can't stop to save my soul  
I take the leash that's leading me  
I'm bleeding me  
I can't take it  
I can't take it  
I can't take it  
The bleeding of me  
  
I'm digging my way  
I'm digging my way to something  
I'm digging my way to something better  
  
I'm pushing to stay  
I'm pushing to stay with something  
I'm pushing to stay with something better  
With something better

I Want To Live
John Denver
----------------
There are children raised in sorrow  
On a scorched and barren plain  
There are children raised beneath a golden sun  
There are children of the water  
Children of the sand  
And they cry out through the universe  
Their voices raised as one  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live  
  
Have you gazed out on the ocean  
Seen the breaching of a whale?  
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?  
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away  
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live  
  
For the worker and the warrior the lover and the liar  
For the native and the wanderer in kind  
For the maker and the user and the mother and her son  
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine  
  
We are standing all together  
Face to face and arm in arm  
We are standing on the threshold of s dream  
No more hunger no more killing  
No more wasting life away  
It is simply an idea  
And I know its time has come  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live

Easter Song
Keith Green
----------------
Hear the bells ringing  
They're singing that you can be born again  
Hear the bells ringing  
They're singing Christ is risen from the dead  
  
The angel up on the tombstone  
Said He has risen, just as He said  
Quickly now, go tell his disciples  
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead  
  
Joy to the word, He has risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
  
Hear the bells ringing  
They're singing that you can be healed right now  
Hear the bells ringing, they're singing  
Christ, He will reveal it now  
  
The angels, they all surround us  
And they are ministering Jesus' power  
Quickly now, reach out and receive it  
For this could be your glorious hour  
  
Joy to the world, He has risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
The angel up on the tombstone  
Said He has risen, just as He said  
Quickly now, go tell his disciples  
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead  
  
Joy to the world, He has risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
Hallelujah

Rewind
Flo-Rida
----------------
If you love somebody  
Put a light in the air  
From the hood to the stakes  
Fry your finger in the air  
Flo Rida up in here  
Wyclef up in here  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
  
I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to  
But these tears got me searching for an inner tube  
Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose  
Don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical  
I pop champagne, but still it's a damn pain  
BD I love you my sister died but it never changed  
My last love that we just ditched in my brain  
Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name  
The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain  
Lord knows I wish death never had a name  
Our last breath that it never had a relevate  
Wyclef, Flo Rida here to tell it man  
To the left, move, hurt for suffering  
I lose myself when I think about my people's slain  
If I could I'd rewind this whole thing  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
So I sit down and I had try  
Are you living up in this life?  
I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
  
If I could take yesterday and place it in my palms  
I anticipate the day like a school prom  
Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some  
Big will I know heaven got the futon  
Face good with the man paid your dues done  
Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk  
We had plans, plans change the new sun  
The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one  
If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past  
I wish life was TiVo and you could bring it back  
I wish it all was remote and how the day be said  
I were IP use it like its pixel flap  
Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times  
Everyday be forever when I'm putting down  
Showing off that's the truth nah  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
So I sit down and I had try  
Are you living up in this life?  
I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
  
If I had the gift be here I'd cure your mom from cancer  
Take the Breena and stuck em up all with answers  
Take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen  
Have her graduate suma ku la day  
But she so high that she's riding on drug assist  
Growing up like the women from the exorcist  
Her heart stopped in the ambulance  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
So I sit down and I had try  
Are you living up in this life?  
I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind

Living Hell
Misfits
----------------
Imprisoned in this world of darkness few have known  
A monster lusting blood and the hunger grows  
Out on the street, danger's real, the killer's still at large  
A trail of death through sewers to the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
This town has worn thin everybody knows  
Panic in the news and the terror grows  
A tunnel full of filth escape into the night  
Another hole to dwell in the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
In this living hell  
In this living hell  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell

Bringing Out The Elvis
Faith Hill
----------------
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
  
Just like a fossil  
Frozen in time I could not move  
My heart, my soul, my feet  
Then you unearthed me  
And put me in a hot pulsating groove  
Now I'm a slave to the beat  
  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing  
  
When I'm with you  
I never have to feel like a sardine  
In a little metal can  
I'm more like a wild shark  
That travels in a pink limosuine, yeah  
Yeah, together with my fans  
  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing, oh yeah  
  
People think I'm a silly fool  
Because I think you are so nice and cool  
And some people say  
You're so square  
But I don't care  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me

Revolution Calling
Queensryche
----------------
For a price I'd do about anything  
Except pull the trigger  
For that I'd need a pretty good cause  
Then I heard of Dr. X  
The man with the cure  
Just watch the television  
Yeah, you'll see there's something going on  
  
Got no love for politicians  
Or that crazy scene in D.C.  
It's just a power mad town  
But the time is ripe for changes  
There's a growing feeling  
That taking a chance on a new kind of vision is due  
  
I used to trust the media  
To tell me the truth, tell us the truth  
But now I've seen the payoffs  
Everywhere I look  
Who do you trust when everyone's a crook?  
  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling you  
(There's a) Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Gotta make a change  
Gotta push, gotta push it on through  
  
I'm tired of all this bullshit  
They keep selling me on T.V.  
About the communist plan  
And all the shady preachers  
Begging for my cash  
Swiss bank accounts while giving their  
Secretaries the slam  
  
They're all in Penthouse now  
Or Playboy magazine, million dollar stories to tell  
I guess Warhol wasn't wrong  
Fame fifteen minutes long  
Everyone's using everybody, making the sale  
  
I used to think  
That only America's way, way was right  
But now the holy dollar rules everybody's lives  
Gotta make a million doesn't matter who dies  
  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling you  
(There's a) Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Gotta make a change  
Gotta push, gotta push it on through  
  
I used to trust the media  
To tell me the truth, tell us the truth  
But now I've seen the payoffs  
Everywhere I look  
Who do you trust when everyone's a crook?  
  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling you  
(There's a) Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Gotta make a change  
Gotta push, gotta push it on through

One Sunny Day
Fleetwood Mac
----------------
Written by danny kirwan.  
  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day  
Times I've wondered  
Why it is a lonesome day  
Times I've wondered  
Why it is a lonesome day  
I see you walking  
See you walking away  
All I want from you  
Is more then I can do  
There's one thing that I know  
I'll never let you go  
Although the people say  
I shouldn't treat you this way  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day  
All I want from you  
Is more then I can do  
There's one thing that I know  
I'll never let you go  
Although the people say  
I shouldn't treat you this way  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day

Feeling That Way
Journey
----------------
Opened my eyes to a new kind of way  
All the good times that you saved  
Are you feeling,  
You feeling that way too  
Or am I just,  
Am I just a fool  
  
When the summer's gone  
She'll be there standing by the light  
Once she's bee to where she's gone to  
She should know wrong from right  
  
A new road's waiting, you touched my life  
Soft and warm on a summer's night  
You're the only one, the only one I love  
The lovely one, I'm thinking of

Walking is an art, so is my body  
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party  
  
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips above the 'cardi

Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck  
May all the stars in the sky  
Bow down to you, we're through"  
  
You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty  
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly  
  
Party favor favorite of them all

Sick off your naughtiness

And she's full of rage like me  
And I like the game, yo"  
  
Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous  
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo

Hole In My Soul
Aerosmith
----------------
I'm down a one way street  
With a one night stand  
With a one track mind  
Out in no man's land  
The punishment sometimes  
Don't seem to fit the crime  
  
Yeah there's a hole in my soul  
But one thing I've learned  
For every love letter written  
There's another one burned  
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time  
  
Is it over?  
Is it over?  
Cause I'm blowin' out the flame  
  
Take a walk outside your mind  
Tell me how it feels to be  
The one who turns  
The knife inside of me  
  
Take a look and you will find  
There's nothing there, girl  
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you, girl yeah 'cause  
  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
That's been killing me forever  
It's a place where a garden never grows  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
Yeah, I should have known better  
Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm as dry as a seven year drought  
I got dust for tears  
Yeah I'm all tapped out  
Sometimes I feel broken and can't get fixed  
  
I know there's been all kinds of shoes  
Underneath your bed  
Now I sleep with my boots on  
But you're still in my head  
And something tells me this time  
I'm down to my last licks  
  
Cause if it's over  
Then it's over  
And it's driving me insane  
  
Take a walk outside your mind  
Tell me how it feels to be  
The one who turns  
The knife inside of me  
Take a look and you will find  
There's nothing there, girl, yeah, I swear  
I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause  
  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
That's been killing me forever  
It's a place where a garden never grows  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
Yeah, I should have known better  
Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Yeah, is it over?  
Yeah, it's over  
And I'm blowing out the flame  
  
Take a walk outside your mind  
Tell me how it feels to be  
The one who turns  
The knife inside of me  
Take a look and you will find  
There's nothing there, girl, yeah, I swear  
I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause  
  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
That's been killing me forever  
It's a place where a garden never grows  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
Yeah, I should have known better  
Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose

Fur pyjamas

Hot Potata'  
It's tickling my fancy  
Speak up, I can't hear you  
  
Here on this mountaintop  
Woahoho

Ho, ha!  
Living wild, wild life.

You wrestle, with your partner  
Sittin' on a window sill, but he  
Spends his time behind closed doors  
  
Check out Mr. Businessman  
Oh, ho ho  
He bought some wild, wild life  
On the way to the stock exchange  
Oh, ho ho  
He got some wild, wild life  
Break it up when he opens the door  
Whoahoho

Living wild, wild life  
  
Peace of mind?  
Piece of cake!  
Thought control!  
You get on board anytime you like

Things fall apart, it's scientific  
  
Sleeping on the interstate  
Woah ho ah

Checkin' in, a checkin' out!

Doctor Wu
Steely Dan
----------------
Katy tried  
I was halfway crucified  
I was on the other side  
Of no tomorrow  
You walked in  
And my life began again  
Just when I'd spent the last piaster  
I could borrow  
All night long  
We would sing that stupid song  
And every word we sang  
I knew was true  
Are you with me Doctor Wu  
Are you really just a shadow  
Of the man that I once knew  
Are you crazy are you high  
Or just an ordinary guy  
Have you done all you can do  
Are you with me Doctor  
  
Don't seem right  
I've been strung out here all night  
I've been waiting for the taste  
You said you'd bring to me  
Biscayne Bay  
Where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day  
I went searching for the song  
You used to sing to me  
Katy lies  
You could see it in her eyes  
But imagine my surprise  
When I saw you  
  
Are you with me Doctor Wu  
Are you really just a shadow  
Of the man that I once knew  
She is lovely yes she's sly  
And you're an ordinary guy  
Has she finally got to you  
Can you hear me Doctor

----------------
[Chorus]  
I don't accommodate nobody  
I just take care of myself  
Gotta house down on a dusty road  
I don't need nobody else  
I gotta wife and some kids  
I don't know where they're at  
I know many many people  
But I ain't got no friends  
  
Well I used to have some values  
Now they just make me laugh  
I used to think things would work out fine  
But they never did do that  
All these bosses and the rules  
It's hard for me to fit in  
Must be ten million people  
But I ain't got no friends  
  
Well I'm a little isolated  
I live most days in my head  
And when I go to sleep at night  
I got no sheets on my bed  
I'm a little hard headed  
I can't wait for this to end  
I see people coming and going  
But I ain't a got no friends  
  
Well I look out of my window  
Into the darkness of night  
My head gets to spinning  
So I shut out the light  
I don't care if I see tomorrow  
If I had a reason I'd pretend  
I know one thing for certain  
I ain't a got no friends  
  
Well one of these days my anger  
Get the best of my soul  
In one desperate moment  
I'm gonna dig me a hole  
I'm gonna lie down in it  
And let be what will be  
When the morning sun rises  
There'll be no one to mourn for me  
  
When the morning sun rises  
There'll be no one to mourn for me  
  
[Chorus]

A Little At A Time
Johnny Cash

Stop lovin' me a little at a time, let me lose you a little at a time  
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me a little at a time  
  
For my benefit try to cry a little bit  
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak  
I put up a fight but I'll be all right if you stop lovin' me a little at a
time  
  
Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time  
Walk away slow like you don't want to go leave me, a little at a time  
  
For my benefit try to cry a little bit  
A little at a time, a little at a time, a little at a time, a little at a time

Headless Boogie
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
Headless Boogie  
[Violent J]  
It's Friday night, dark, scary  
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery  
And its foggy, cold and smoggy  
Hear a dog, a howling doggy  
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun  
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one  
So I watch my back, and what's that  
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback  
Better run, hide, quick, fast  
He's coming for my ass with a shovel  
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit  
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit  
Took a fall, deeper than six foot  
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door  
Into a whole new world of stiffs  
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks  
Club lights, sounds, bass  
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face  
And what I saw next then really took me  
Uh, they did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Hey yo, I heard that you died  
Fuck that, it's time to get live  
Dead bodies let's all take a ride  
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)  
"Oh yeah, we dug up the finest  
Bitches in the graveyard  
So come on down  
And if you ain't come to get your funk out  
Then get the fuck out, bitch"  
[Violent J]  
They all stand straight and swing to the side  
No heads, but they feet still glide  
Take a step back, twist and dive  
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)  
No heads, but they all funky  
And drunk, drinking old Spunky  
Don't be shy, everyone's able  
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table  
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off  
If you're dead, your legs might fall off  
The whole time I can't believe  
I can't conceive, I don't want to leave  
I'm kicking into a freak with no head  
No face, but the rest is straight  
She's with it, I hit it like a G  
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me  
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein  
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine  
Dead stiffs coming through the door  
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor  
I'm getting drunk, I want to be down, what's up  
I want to be the headless clown  
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw  
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"Hey yo, fuck that voodoo moshing, bitch  
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos  
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off  
So you get grave dancing!!!"  
[Chorus (4x)]

Step Out Of Hell
Helloween

Time has come  
Start your search for tomorrow  
No escape  
From that long trail of sorrow  
You don't know how it keeps goin' on, oh no  
  
Wake up out of misty dreams  
Evil drug is starting to grab you, to grab you  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my heand I want to help (but can I?)  
  
You did your best  
To keep yourself down  
Give it a rest  
And just turn around!  
It's only a one way street of lies, yes it is!  
  
Living in a twilight zone  
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my heand I want to help you  
  
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind  
To turn your brain inside out  
To serve the final right  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my hand I want to help you!

Mediate
INXS
----------------
Hallucinate  
Desegregate  
Mediate  
Alleviate  
Try not to hate  
  
Love your mate  
Don't suffocate on your own hate  
Designate your love as fate  
A one world state  
As human freight  
The number eight  
A white black state  
A gentle trait  
The broken crate  
A heavy weight  
Or just too late  
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate  
Now devastate  
Appreciate  
Depreciate  
Fabricate  
Emulate  
The truth dilate  
Special date  
The animal we ate  
Guilt debate  
The edge serrate  
A better rate  
The youth irate  
Deliberate  
  
Fascinate  
Deviate  
Reinstate  
Liberate  
To moderate  
Recreate  
Or detonate  
Annihiliate  
Atomic fate  
  
Mediate  
Clear the state  
Activate  
Now radiate  
A perfect state  
Food on plate  
Gravitate  
The Earth's own weight  
Designate your love as fate  
At ninety-eight we all rotate  
  
Hallucinate  
Desegregate  
Mediate  
Alleviate  
Try not to hate  
  
Love your mate  
Don't suffocate on your own hate  
Designate your love as fate  
A one world state  
As human freight  
The number eight  
A white black state  
A gentle trait  
The broken crate  
  
A heavy weight  
Or just too late  
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate  
  
Now devastate  
Appreciate  
Depreciate  
Fabricate  
Emulate  
The truth dilate  
Special date  
The animals we ate  
Guilt debate  
The edge serrate  
A better rate  
The youth irate  
Deliberate

Deviate  
Reinstate

Keep Your Head Up
Michael Jackson
----------------
She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay,  
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promising,  
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive,  
She works in a restaurant, night and day  
She waits her life away  
She wipes the tears away  
  
She cries inside every time she feels this way,  
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries, no  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
Keepin' your mind up stay alive,  
Gimme your wings so we can fly,  
(Keep your head up tonight)  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
And we can just rise up tell me now,  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
  
Giving up the life in the birds in the trees  
And we're sucking up the air in the earth from under me,  
(It's never too late)  
I can't even breathe (to see) I can't even see,  
(Oh keep) Keep your head up don't give up today,  
How long can we wait?  
I wish that love would come today  
  
All you need is love,  
Tell you I'm know it's comin' soon,  
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do,  
Keep your head up  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
Keepin' your mind to stay alive  
Gimme your wings so we can fly,  
(fly away, fly away, fly away)  
(Keep your head up tonight)  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
And we can just rise up tell me now,  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
(Oh why)  
  
Everybody say the time is borrowed  
And hanging down your head just ain't no good  
And if you dance and rise above tomorrow  
(Give it a chance)  
Just give yourself a chance,  
Find the circumstance,  
Rise and do it again  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky (Oh God)  
Keepin' your mind up stay alive (Oh no)  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
(Yeah, yeah!)  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
And we can just rise up tell me now  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
  
(I needed you know, I needed you now)  
Keepin' your head up to the sky  
(I needed you night right through the day)  
Keepin' your mind just stay alive  
(I needed you now)  
Keepin' your wings so we can fly (Woo! woo!)  
(Yeah!)  
  
(I needed you know, I needed you now)  
Keepin' your head up to the sky  
(I needed you night right through the day)  
And we can just rise up tell me now  
(I needed you now)  
Keepin' your wings so we can fly (Woo! woo! woo!)  
  
Gonna shine his smile on us today  
Keep your head up  
Gonna shine his smile on us today, today  
Keep your head up  
  
Those songs gon' rise on us today, today  
Gonna shine his smile on us today, today  
  
(I needed you now, I needed you now)  
Those songs gon' rise on us today, today  
(I needed you night right through the day)  
(I needed you now)  
Gonna shine his smile on us today, today  
Keep your head up

Bob Rivers

The first thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me  
Is finding a Christmas tree  
The second thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me:  
Rigging up the lights  
And finding a Christmas tree  
The third thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me  
Hangovers  
Rigging up the lights  
And finding a Christmas tree  
The fourth thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me  
Sending Christmas cards  
Hangovers  
Rigging up the lights  
And finding a Christmas tree

Five months of bills!  
Sending Christmas cards  
Hangovers  
Rigging up the lights  
And finding a Christmas tree  
The sixth thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me:  
Facing my in-laws  
Five months of bills!  
I hate those Christmas cards!  
Hangovers  
Rigging up these lights!  
And finding a Christmas tree  
The seventh thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me:  
The Salvation Army  
Facing my in-laws  
Five months of bills!  
Sending Christmas cards  
Oh, geez!  
I'm tryin' to rig up these lights!  
And finding a Christmas tree  
The eighth thing at Christmas that such a pain to me:  
I wanna transformer for christmas!  
Charities,  
And what'cha mean "YOUR in-laws"! ?

Oh, making out these cards  
Honey, get me a beer, huh?

And finding a Christmas tree  
The ninth thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me  
Finding parking spaces

Hangovers  
Now why the hell are they blinking! ?

And finding a Christmas tree  
The eleventh thing at Christmas that's such a pain to me  
Stale tv specials  
Batteries not included  
No parking spaces  
Mom I gotta go to the bathroom!

She's a witch, I hate her!  
Five months of bills  
Oh, I don't even know half these people!  
Who's got the toilet paper?  
Get a flashlight I blew a fuse!

Gotta make 'em dinner  
Five months of bills  
I'm not sending them this year, that's it!  
Shut up, you!  
Fine! You're so smart, you rig up the lights!  
And finding a Christmas tree

Wrapped Up In You
Garth Brooks
----------------
How do I love you. well let me see  
I love you like a lyric love a melody  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you  
How do I need you, well can't you tell  
I need you like a penny needs a wishing well  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Every now and then when the world  
That we're living in is crazy  
You gladly hold me and carry me through  
No one in the world has ever done  
What you do for me and I'd be  
Sad and lonely if there were no you  
  
How do I love you, well count the ways  
There ain't a number high enough to end this phrase  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How do I love you, well, don't you know  
I love you about as deep as any love can grow  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you

Echos Myron
Guided By Voices
----------------
Tower to the skies  
An academy of lies  
And what goes up  
Surely must come down  
And we felt the mighty blow-up  
With the walls coming down  
Or something like that  
most of us are quite pleased  
With the same old song  
And all of a sudden I'm relatively sane  
With everything to lose and nothing to gain  
Or something like that  
man of wisdom and man of compromise  
Man of weak flesh in an armored disguise  
All fall down  
  
"if it's right you can tell" echos myron like a siren  
With endurance like the liberty bell  
And he tells you of the dreamers  
But he's cracked up like the road  
And he'd like to lift us up, but we're a very heavy load  
And we're finally here and shit yeah it's cool  
And shouldn't it be - or something like that

Smooth Dancer
Deep Purple
----------------
Black suede, don't mean you're good for me  
Black suede, just brings your mystery  
I want to be inside of you  
But you're black and I don't know what to do  
  
You're a smooth dancer  
But it's alright  
'Cause I'm a freelancer  
And you can never break me though you try  
  
To make me think you're magical  
Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun  
Because it don't shine nightly  
Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free  
  
You'd better hang on tightly  
You want to rule the world,  
But you're acting like a girl  
Who's got a false pregnancy  
You've swollen up inside  
With nothing but your pride  
  
And yet you keep on dancing  
Black suede, don't waste your time on me  
Black suede, I sense your mockery  
I tried to go along with you  
  
But you're black and I know just what to do  
You're a smooth dancer  
But it's alright  
'Cause I'm a freelancer  
  
And you can never break me though you try  
To make me think you're magical  
I think you're crazy, your two-timing ways  
They don't bother me none  
  
You'd better do it right because one day or night  
I'm gonna walk to freedom  
You know I loved you once and I want to love again  
But you don't give nothing  
  
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize  
Baby, I ain't bluffing  
Black suede, don't waste your time on me  
Black suede, don't bring me misery  
  
I tried to be inside of you  
But you're black and now I know what to do  
You're a smooth dancer  
But it's alright  
  
'Cause I'm a freelancer  
And I can tell you're faking though you try  
To make me think you're magical  
Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun  
  
Because it don't shine nightly  
Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free  
You'd better hang on tightly  
You know I loved you once and I want to love again  
  
But you don't give nothing  
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize  
Baby, I ain't bluffing  
Baby, you can rock 'n' roll  
  
But you can never show your soul, smooth dancer

My Love
Zucchero
----------------
Stray cat in a mad dog city  
9 ways to sorrow  
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye  
  
I'm waiting  
  
Wild cat in a sad dog story  
9 roads to follow  
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye  
  
For all the love that's torn us, for us  
For all the pain so sweet  
Say you won't, say you won't leave  
  
My love, I'm dreaming of one girl  
Someone to make my world  
Someone just like you  
My love, the girl that I'm dreamin'  
To give me that feeling  
Someone just like you  
  
Stray cat in a mad dog city  
9 lives to borrow  
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye  
  
I'm waiting  
  
Lost cat in a dead end story  
9 lines that echo  
A moment's all it takes to say goodbye  
  
For all the love before us, for us  
For all the pain so sweet  
Say you won't, say you won't leave  
  
My love, I'm dreaming of one girl  
Someone to make my world  
Someone just like you  
My love, the girl that I'm dreamin'  
To give me that feeling  
Someone just like you  
  
Siamo caduti in volo, mio sole  
Siamo caduti in volo  
Siamo caduti in volo, mio cielo  
Siamo caduti in volo  
  
Gonna paint this town, for you  
Turn it upside down  
Say you won't, say you won't leave  
  
My love, I'm dreaming of one girl  
Someone to make my world  
Someone just like you  
My love, the girl that I'm dreamin'  
To give me that feeling  
Someone just like you  
  
My love, I'm dreaming of one girl  
Someone to make my world  
Someone just like you

Hypnotise
Kim Wilde
----------------
I can't help it when you're near me  
I don't think straight, I get all confused  
I just lose all my concentration  
With no question at all I'd surrender to you  
Standing here so close together  
I can feel all the magic again  
But I'm holding back the emotion  
Couldn't take anymore of the heartache and pain  
I know I should take it slow but,  
The minute I see you I just let go  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It's a gamble, can we take it  
Playing safe is no way to survive  
There's a chance for us, we can make it  
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive  
Admit that we made mistakes but  
I know in my heart that it's not too late  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It feels like I'm falling in love with you all over again  
And I'm trying not to let it show  
But the minute I see you I just let go  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control

I Feel Like Flying Away
Tom T. Hall
----------------
I woke up this morning feeling so good feeling much better than I though I
could  
Bluebird would you lend me your wings today I feel like flying away  
I feel like flying away  
Fly up to Mexico maybe to Spain I've got some good friends who live up in
Maine  
Fly up to Paris and sample the wine ain't that a magnificient line  
Oh forgive me for saying I'd always be blue  
I should have known better that sun has come through  
My silver lining is turned inside out there's the sun everyone shouts  
Oh I feel like flying away  
  
Fly up to Mexico maybe to Spain...  
I feel like flying away

Fly Me - Yesterday Today B - Side
Ocean Colour Scene
----------------
Fly me - my hands are free  
Won't you fly me  
  
Look towards what you're dreaming of  
Write it down and look above  
For something that will tell you I watch you  
I'm looking for to do  
  
Won't you fly me - my hands are  
Won't you fly me  
  
Picture floating in a silent row  
Crying out for those who've never learnt  
That life is just a story you pass through  
While dreaming what to do  
  
Won't you fly me  
Won't you please fly me  
Won't you please fly me  
  
Won't you fly me...

Mucky Fingers
Oasis
----------------
I know you think you deserve an explanation on the meanings of life.  
But what you think that you heard slipped away out the back of your mind.  
You'll get your mucky fingers burned.  
You get your truth from the lies you were learned.  
And all your plastic believers will leave us and they won't return.  
  
And when you look in that mirror  
And you're tying up your buttons and bows.  
And as you face your disease you can squeeze into the Emporer's Clothes.  
You found your god in a paper bag, you get your history from the Union Jack.  
And all your brothers and sisters are gone and they won't come back.  
  
I'm fed up with life in the City,  
All the phoneys have blown my mind.  
When I'm gone, you look like you'd miss me,  
So come along with me - but don't ask why,  
'Cause it's all mine,  
It's all mine.  
It's all mine.  
It's all mine.  
  
[Harmonica Solo]  
  
'Cause it's all mine  
It's all mine  
It's all mine  
It's all mine  
  
[Harmonica Solo 2]

I Love You
Vanilla Ice
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Girl, I keep thinkin' of how I feel  
When I'm in your arms gives me a chill  
Just knowin' that you want me by your side  
Mellows my mind and enhances my pride  
Girl, I need you more and more each day  
Believe me when I tell you I'm here to stay  
I'm captured by your love and your pretty smile  
You devastating beauty and your sweet profile  
[Chorus]  
I love you, cause I love you  
I love you, cause I love you  
[Verse 2]  
You're so fine, let's wine and dine  
I'm so happy that you are mine  
Thinking of you I melt with desire  
Take you in my arms, let love take us higher  
To hear you talk, sounds so sweet  
When you're close to me I feel your heat  
Girl, I want you and you want me  
And it'll last until eternity  
You're like the snow fallin' from the sky  
So clean, like the look in your eye  
You're my queen, i'll buy you everything  
Yes, girl, even diamond rings  
Cause you're my lady, and this love is true  
Every sunset makes me think of you  
And i'll never forget what you mean to me  
Comin' straight from the heart of vanilla i-see-e  
Chorus  
[Outro]  
Hello girl, when I first saw you. it was love at first sight  
We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same  
I know I haven't said it much before...well...it's because  
See, I get all choked up inside. it just doesn't want to  
Come out. I don't know. maybe this'll help all the bad  
Things i've done. so, no matter what goes on, no matter  
What happens, always remember...I love you!

Scavenger Type
NOFX
----------------
Gigin alone at the bottom of the hill  
Our protagonist named Bill  
Sets his sights on an anchor steam pint  
All he needs is thirteen quarters  
Congregated in his hat  
  
A crow, a scavenger type  
California redemption provides him with his rent  
Room and board inside a fifth of comfort  
  
As the wind penetrates his bones  
His mind keeps focused  
Tidal waves of sound catapulted  
From his horn wail like lovers  
  
The coins don't drop consistent as does the mercury  
His meter slows realizing a zenith  
He's reached perfection  
No one did see him die

Come on and shake  
Shake it up babe  
Come on come on shake it up babe

I like the way you talk  
When you walk that walk  
And you talk that talk  
You knock me out  
Right over my feet  
  
Shake it up babe  
Come on and shake  
Shake it up babe  
Come on come on shake it up babe

A love that is true

Star
Erasure
----------------
Star  
We go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
You got to look real hard  
There's a fiery star  
Hidden out there somewhere  
Not the satellite of love  
But a laser  
Shooting out it's shiny tongue there  
  
God is love, God is war  
TV-preacher tell me more  
Load redeem me, am I pure?  
As pure as pure as heaven  
Sent you money sent you flowers  
Could worship you for hours  
In whose hands are we anyway?  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
You got to look real hard  
Is it in your heart?  
Yeah it's in there somewhere  
The power wrapped in your palm  
Show it to me  
Hit them with your wrath and thunder  
  
What's your pleasure?  
Tell it to me  
How did you know?  
Show your beauty  
In you somewhere, somewhere in me  
Pure as pure as heaven  
Sent you money sent you flowers  
Could worship you for hours  
In whose hands are we anyway?  
Yeeha  
  
Rolling along through a rose colored glow  
The city looks pretty in pink  
Armageddon is here!  
  
Did you ever have a lover  
Leave you for another  
To take your love and kisses for granted?  
Never to discover  
War is not the answer  
Leave you only disenchanted  
  
God is love, God is war  
TV-preacher tell me more  
Father help me am I pure?  
As pure as pure as heaven  
Sent you money sent you flowers  
Could worship you for hours  
In whose hands are we anyway?  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down

Beautiful Strange
Prince
----------------
Strangely beautiful  
Beautiful strange  
That's what we said  
Instead of the name  
If you count the times  
He took all the blame  
You would find the reason  
Behind the game  
  
In the darkness  
We must look 4 the way  
Words so strange  
That only the mind can say  
If it makes no mind  
What color or holy day  
Why is this game  
The only one that we play  
  
Dive inside your sould if you wanna know  
The light inside the darkness 4ever glows  
The son is like the diamond inside the coal  
And like an embryo it grows and grows

The Gentle Art Of Making Enemies
Faith No More
----------------
The words are so familiar-  
All the same greats, the same mistakes  
It doesn't have to be like this.  
If you don't make a friend, now  
One might make you-  
So learn  
The gentle art of making enemies  
Don't look so surprised  
Happy birthday...Fucker  
Blow that candle out,  
We're gonnaa kick you  
[Don't say you're not because you are]  
[Don't say you're not because you are]  
[History tells us that you are]  
[History tells us that you are]  
All you need is just one more excuse  
You put up one hell of a fight  
I want to hear your very best excuse  
Never felt this much alive  
Your day has finally come  
So wear the hat and do the dance  
And let the suit keep wearing you.  
This year you'll sit and take it  
And you will like it  
It's the gentle art of making enemies  
I deserve a reward  
'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had  
And if I tighten up my hole  
You may never see the light again  
[There's always an easy way out]  
[There's always an easy way out]  
[You need something wet in your mouth]  
[You need something wet in your mouth]  
Never felt this much alive

A little woozy but a nice night  
What the fuck right now?  
What the fuck right now?  
What the, what the fuck right now?  
What if we fuck right now?  
What if we fucked right in the middle  
Of this motherfuckin' dinner table  
What if we just fucked up this whole party  
Would we be the life of the whole party?  
Shut down the whole party  
Would everybody stop buggin'?  
Would everybody stop buggin'?  
Would everybody stop buggin'? They don't want nothin'  
You motherfuckers living like half of your level, half of your life  
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto, I ain't gon' lie

I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye  
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's  
I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called "I miss the old Kanye"  
Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye  
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

Flesh
Aerosmith
----------------
The day rolls in, the night rolls out  
Desire rules without a doubt  
The heart beats fast, you salivate  
And when you come, it won't be late  
I guess by now, you got the score  
A little taste you want it more  
From San Antone to Marrakesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have flesh  
You got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
From the day that Eve did Adam down to Romeo and Juliet  
Everybody gotta have  
The prince of lust has met his match  
The witch has brewed her baddest batch  
His sword is sharp and hard as stone  
Her cauldron begs for one more bone  
And so my love, this story's told  
From modern times to days of old  
From Boston, Mass to Bangladesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have  
Flesh - it's got me all soaking wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat, yeah  
From the Mississippi River  
To the highest mountain in Tibet  
Everybody gotta have  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing, the only thing, the only thing  
From a Sufi in a Rickshaw to a bimbo in a pink Corvette  
Everybody gotta have

Evergreen
Kenny Rogers
----------------
Love, soft as an easy chair  
Love, fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love, ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
  
You and I will  
make each night the first  
Everyday a beginning  
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed  
  
They warm and excite us  
'Cause we have the brightest love  
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun  
Time, we've learned to sail above  
  
Time, won't change the meaning of one love  
Ageless and ever evergreen

Dress You Up
Madonna

You've got style  
That's what all the girls say  
Satin sheets  
And luxuries so fine  
All your suits are custom made in London  
I've got something that you'll really like  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over your body  
  
Feel the silky touch of my caresses  
They will keep you looking so brand new  
Let me cover you with velvet kisses  
I'll create a look that's made for you  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over your body  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
In my love  
All over your body  
All over your body  
In my love  
All over, all over

Mind Your Own Business
Hank Williams Jr.
----------------
If the wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right  
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight  
Why don't you mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
'Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.  
  
Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing  
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring  
Why don't you mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
Well, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.  
  
I got a little gal that wears her hair up high,  
The boys all whistle when she walks by.  
Why don't you mind your own buisness  
(Mind your own business)  
Well, if you mind your own business, you sure won't be minding mine.  
  
If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three  
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me.  
Just mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.  
  
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned  
I got all that I can do just to mind my own  
Why don't you mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
If you mind your own business, you'll stay busy all the time.

Get It Right
Out Of Eden
----------------
So many times I've walked this way  
Too many times from you I've strayed  
Fallen way behind, too my former state of mind  
I look around what do I see, so many strugglin' just like me  
Tryin' to live this life, falling down to compromise  
But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?  
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more  
I find that we have settled too many times  
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know  
Chorus:  
We need to get it right  
No need to walk this way this way no more  
We need to step in the light,  
And find out what we're livin' for  
The voice of God is drawing near  
Only the wisest ones will hear  
Seeing the world today will you choose to go his way  
It doesn't end in choosin', because in all we do  
We're called to keep on goin', pressin' on just to remain true  
(chorus)  
I can see how the other life it must look so nice  
But what lies after it's over far from paradise  
Gotta know there is nothing worth missing the call  
Let me tell you He is calling and you've got to give your all  
(chorus out)

You will search, babe, at any cost,  
But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost ?  
Everybody will help you,  
Some people are very kind.  
But if I can save you any time,  
Come on, give it to me,  
I'll keep it with mine.  
  
I can't help it if you might think I am odd  
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are  
But for what you're not.  
Everybody will help you,  
Discover what you set out to find  
But if I can save you any time,  
Come on, give it to me,  
I'll keep it with mine.  
  
The train leaves at half past ten  
But it'll be back tomorrow same time again.  
The conductor, he's weary,  
Still stuck on the line.  
But if I can save you any time,  
Come on, give it to me,  
I'll keep it with mine.

Where Do I Begin?
Idina Menzel
----------------
Where do I begin my love?  
Starting with the things I haven't said enough of  
Starting with the day you changed my life and ending with the way I feel
tonight  
Where do I begin?  
  
Where do I belong if you're not here?  
This is way beyond my darkest fear  
Don't know where I am or where I start  
The trail in between is way too far  
Where do I begin?  
  
I've always counted all my blessings  
Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side  
I always turn and lose my sense's each time I intended words to come out right  
Where do I begin my love?  
  
Maybe with the morning you brought me the sun  
Maybe with the stars from out of space  
You took a few and lit up my face  
Where do I begin?  
  
I've always counted all my blessings  
Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side  
I always turn and lose my senses each time I intended for these words would
come out right  
  
Where do I begin my love?  
I always read the last page instead of the first one  
There's no need to rush it all in  
I love you and I'll say it again  
Where do I begin?  
Where do we begin?

You Can Touch
Crowded House
----------------
It could spell my mere defeat  
You could find it's what you need  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know I'm alive  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
My condition is hard to define  
I'm thin and pale and I need to unwind  
See no future from where I stand  
For the present I am in your hands  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know I'm alive  
It is only passing through  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
You can touch me  
I won't die

Walk Away
The Script
----------------
I don't know why she's with me  
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her, by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
But now I've broken away  
Somehow instead she forgave me  
She said a woman's got to do what she's got to do  
Even if it means she denied herself the truth  
'Cause when you're in too deep you wake up when it's too late,  
You've fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me  
  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
  
She's standing in the heart of darkness  
Saying I know you got a soul even though you're heartless  
How could any woman in their right mind be so blind,  
To find something this safe  
Instead of walking with me she should have walked away  
  
She finds color in the darkest places  
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces  
For such a clued in, headstrong city girl  
Could've had the world but she's fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me  
  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
(Oh, yeah)  
But still she stays  
(Oh, yeah)  
  
I don't know why she's with me  
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her, by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
  
But you've fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me  
  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
  
(Yeah)  
But still she stays, eh  
I'm saying walk away  
Yeah  
I'm saying walk away  
(Save yourself from the heartache, go now before it's too late)  
But still she stays  
Still she stays  
Yeah, she stays  
She stays

My Heart Was Home Again
Josh Groban
----------------
So it goes, history shows  
Deserts must expand  
And camels sail like wooden ships  
Like women on the strand  
  
There's sand on Second Avenue  
And the wind blows like a train  
Taxis light up like a string of pearls  
Around the block again  
  
And I remembered everything  
And every windowpane  
Every word came back to me  
The way it used to be  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again  
  
There's a bus that leaves at eight fifteen  
And another one at ten  
Should I climb aboard, risk everything  
And ride it to the end  
  
Watch the hills like roller coasters  
Up against the sky  
And wish that you were here by me  
So close that I could die  
  
You said love wrecks everything  
And none of us survive  
So I got over you last night  
And I am still alive  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again  
  
And I remembered everything  
And every windowpane  
Every word came back to me  
The way it used to be  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again.

Tell Me
Backstreet Boys
----------------
Backstreet Boys - Tell me  
  
(Yeah)  
You can tell me what you want  
  
Girl you struck me like the sun  
So just tell me how you wanna be done  
I know you a couple of weeks  
You seem like you don't play stupid tricks  
  
Sweety you are so beautiful  
I can imagine you must feel wonderful  
I like to know what I need to do  
How to behave, oh how to please you  
I can't take it, oh come home  
Let me feel those hips  
You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you  
  
So let me put my ego on the side (whatever you wish)  
I ain't got no pride  
Girl I became your biggest fan  
I could be your perfect man  
  
Chorus  
You can tell me what you want  
You can tell me what you need  
I will do whatever you want  
Just don't make my heart bleed  
Girl don't you understand  
That your wish is my command  
So baby drop the match  
Show me what's the task  
And tell me everything you want  
  
Girl you told me what was in the past  
All the relationships that never last  
No man ever let you be free  
And oh you're fed up with the jealousy  
  
I'll give you all the freedom that you need  
Baby you and I will succeed  
I like to know what I need to do  
How to behave, oh how to please you  
I can't take it, oh come home  
Let me kiss those lips  
You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you  
  
Don't want violated things and make you mad  
Don't want violated things that make you sad  
Let me just find it right here pretty lady  
We can make it baby  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
What if we loose all the money baby  
What if there's nothing but you and me  
Tell me what would you do pretty lady  
Would you at least take care of me  
  
You can tell me how you deal the stress  
When everything becomes a big mess  
We stay strong and fight it off  
Or would you pack your shhh, and take off..  
  
Spend your life with me baby  
Spend your life with me baby girl  
Spend your life with me baby  
Spend your life with me baby girl  
(2x)  
  
Chorus (2x)

Are 'friends' Electric?
Gary Numan
----------------
It's cold outside  
And the paint's peeling off of my walls  
There's a man outside  
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette  
  
Now the light fades out  
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this  
There's a knock on the door  
And just for a second I thought I remembered you  
  
So now I'm alone  
Now I can think for myself  
About little deals  
And issues  
And things that I just don't understand  
A white lie that night  
Or a sly touch at times  
I don't think it meant anything to you  
  
So I open the door  
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway  
Please sit down  
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed  
  
You know I hate to ask  
But, are 'friends' electric?  
Only mine's broke down  
And now I've no one to love  
  
So I find out your reasons  
For the phone calls and smiles  
And it hurts  
And I'm lonely  
And I should never have tried  
And I missed you tonight  
It must be time to leave  
You see it meant everything to me

Heart-Shaped Box
Nirvana
----------------
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak  
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks  
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap  
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black  
  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice  
  
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet  
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath  
Broken hymen of your Highness, I'm left back  
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back  
  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice  
  
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak  
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks  
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap  
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black  
  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice, your advice, your

Pretty Things
Leann Rimes
----------------
Mama's high heels, cherry lipstick  
And a goodwill dress  
Play pretending, danced for the mirror  
A fairytale princess  
  
[Chorus:]  
Pretty things are yours to hold  
My pretty thing soon you will know  
Pretty things you think you need  
But don't make you beautiful  
Pretty things will rot with love  
Pretty things will fade with time  
It's what's inside that makes you shine  
  
My pretty thing  
  
It's only natural, the table's turning  
And gracefully I'll learn  
How to cradle the one who raised me  
Will be too fragile for this world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Selfless and faithful  
As good as you should be  
Open and fearless  
Oh, what a gift you gave  
  
[Chorus]

Everybody Loves Me
OneRepublic
----------------
Well hell sees her shadow in my backseat  
And her friends are standing right in front of me  
World wide from the center burning turkey  
Open up said everybody loves me  
  
And you don't have to make a sound  
'Cause they got what you need  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
God love all the people that have warned you  
God love all your sentimental virtue  
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you  
Lay calls with the lovers that'll hate you  
  
And you don't have to make a sound  
They got what you need  
What you need  
Make you say  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Well I  
Play the music don't stop till I turn gray  
Stars like forever John Sousa never fade,  
He had a beautiful child, named Desiree  
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made  
  
'Cause you don't have to make a sound  
When they got what you need  
Like you say  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Oh  
Everybody  
Everybody  
  
Don't need my health  
Got my name and got my wealth I  
Stare at the sun  
Just for kicks all by myself I  
Lose track of time  
So I might be past my prime  
But  
I'm feeling oh so good  
Yeah!  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me!  
  
Don't you know you wanna  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Whoa! Yeah!

Shot For Me
Drake
----------------
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry  
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now  
Mad cause he ain't like me  
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take, all the love that we made  
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia  
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man  
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man  
Don't you forget it  
The way you walk, that's me  
The way you talk, that's me  
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?  
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me  
And the voice in your ear, that's me  
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are, then I made it  
And you're wasted with your ladies  
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me  
A shot for me  
A shot for me  
  
Okay look, I'm honest  
Girl I can't lie, I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you  
She says I know you changed, I never see you  
Cause you're always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you  
And heaven accept you

I was here when time began  
I was in them all  
A wicked one magician's hand  
I'm what john had saw  
I'm a thing that lives and breathers  
  
With slaves to worship me  
There are many that are born of me  
Anytime there are many me's  
Crowned messiah, I crucified him  
  
And still ya don't believe  
I am kings - I am queens  
Unholy terrors me  
I'm the feces of the species  
  
Still you're all in awe  
I'm something a prophet saw  
Hister with a rise all fall  
Obsessed with lennon  
  
Manifested marx  
I'm incest in the hearts of dark  
I'm riding on some atomic bomb -  
To blind you all into king-dom-come--  
I am - I am - I am - I am

I'm wheels, I am moving wheels  
I am a 1952 studebaker coupe  
I'm wheels, I am moving wheels moving wheels  
I am a 1952 starlite coupe...  
  
En route, les Souterrains  
Des visions do Cody, Sartori a Paris  
Strange spaghetti in this solemn city  
There's a postcard we're all seen before  
  
Past wild-haired teens in dark clothing  
With hands-full of autographed napkins we  
Eat apples in vans with sandwiches, rush  
Into the lobby life of hurry up and wait  
  
Hurry up and wait for all the odd-shaped keys  
Which lead to new soap and envelopes...  
Hotel room homesickness on a fresh blue bed  
And the longest-ever phone call home, no  
  
Sleep no sleep no sleep no sleep and no mad  
Video machine to eat time, a city scene  
I can't explain, the Seine alone at 4am  
The Seine alone at 4a.m, Neal and Jack and me  
  
Absent lovers, absent lovers

Forever Together
Randy Travis
----------------
I took you for granted  
So many years  
I gave you no hope  
Broken promises and tears  
But when I was down  
It was you who was there  
To pick up the pieces and show me you care  
  
Forever together  
Til' death do we part  
Forsaking all others  
I'll give you my heart  
Through good times and bad times  
Wherever we are  
Forever together  
In each other's arms  
  
You seem to know  
What we had all along  
And you had the love  
And the faith to go on  
It took some time but now I realize  
That I see it all when I look in your eyes  
  
Forever together  
Til' death do we part  
Forsaking all others  
I give you my heart  
Through good times and bad times  
Wherever we are  
Forever together  
In each other's arms  
Forever together  
In each other's arms

Sweet potato pie when you eat from the pan

Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine.  
Can you dig it?  
Dancing the latest dance and eating ribs and tips  
Digging all the new sounds and drinking gin in sips  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine, baby  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul.  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine

Let's go, let's go, let's go.  
To tie up my do right (?) and tighten up my 'fro  
Wrapping myself in black and still I shine and glow  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.

Work, Terrible Work
Horrible Histories
----------------
In good old Queen Victoria's day  
Industrial revolution  
Bosses said 'Please, we need more employees'  
We needed a solution  
  
Who will climb our chimneys?  
Who will power our grids?  
Victorian families to desperately poor  
They'll let us employ their kids for  
  
Work, terible work  
From very young ages  
Up chimneys to clean  
Paid pitiful wages  
Work, terrible work  
Pins make you work faster  
If we grow too big  
Get sacked by the master!  
  
Now you're all in my employ  
Cleaning in the factory  
We're not very strong  
And the hours are long  
This work is unsatisfactory!  
  
There not to get caught in spokes  
Or trap our hands in gages  
To stop machines and get you out  
Will cost you a week's wages!  
  
Work, terrible work  
There's no health and safety  
So if we get hurt  
They will just replace me  
Work, terrible work  
  
Now that I am short of cash  
I have to pick pockets  
Wallets from gentlemen  
And lady's lockets  
  
Small enough to get away  
Hardly ever caught  
And if we are, we're kids you see  
To cry is what we're taught  
  
Work, terrible work  
Dangerous and demeaning  
No time to complain  
Get back to your cleaning  
Work, terrible work  
Guess what we are dreaming  
School, glorious school!  
Wonderful school!  
Marvellous school!  
Wish we went to school!

Leaving Home Ain't Easy
Queen
----------------
I take a step outside  
And I breath the air  
And I slam the door  
And I'm on my way  
I won't lay no blame  
I won't call you names  
'Cause I've made my break  
And I won't look back  
I've turned my back  
On those endless games  
  
I'm all through with ties  
I'm all tired of tears  
I'm a happy man  
Don't it look that way  
Shakin' dust from my shoes  
There's a road ahead  
And there's no way back home (no way back home)  
Oh but I have to say  
  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
Oh I never thought it would be easy  
Leavin' on your own  
Oh is the main thing calling me back  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
On the one you're leavin' home  
  
Stay my love my love please stay  
Don't stray my love  
What's wrong my love?  
What's right my love?  
Oh leavin' home ain't easy  
I thought how could I think of leavin'  
Leavin' on your own  
Still tryin' to persuade me that  
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
But may be the only way

From The Morning
Nick Drake
----------------
A day once dawned  
And it was beautiful  
A day once dawned from the ground  
Then the night she fell  
And the air was beautiful  
The night she fell all around  
  
So look see the days  
The endless coloured ways  
And go play the game that you learnt  
From the morning  
  
And now we rise  
And we are everywhere  
And now we rise from the ground  
And see she flies  
And she is everywhere  
See she flies all around  
  
So look see the sights  
The endless summer nights  
And go play the game that you learnt  
  
From the morning

Someday
Kylie Minogue
----------------
Someday,  
Someday,  
Precious stone,  
Life goes on,  
You have abused and used me,  
Now I'm going home,  
I want my records back,  
To get my heart on track,  
You think I can't be alone,  
Well this woman's here to show you,  
Oh, Someday  
  
The lights will fall and you will know,  
If you do it slowly,  
You might just find it's worth it all,  
Precious stone,  
Life goes on  
  
You feel used and abused,  
Now you're all alone,  
How dare you say,  
I will be back one day,  
You've taken me for granted,  
It's time for me to say  
  
Someday he'll be there to hold you baby,  
There by the grace a sign,  
Someday he'll be there to dry your tears,  
I want my records back,  
To get my heart on track  
  
You think I can't be alone,  
Well this woman's here to show you,  
Oh, How dare you say,  
I will be back one day,  
You've taken me for granted,  
You need to find your way.

You'll Never Walk Alone
Il Divo
----------------
When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high and don't be afraid of
the dark.  
  
At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky, and the sweet silver song of
the lark.  
  
Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain.  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.  
  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart, and you'll never walk, you'll never
walk, you'll never walk alone.  
  
Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain.  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.  
  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart, and you'll never walk, you'll never  
You'll never walk alone, you'll never, you'll never walk alone.

Cry
Roy Orbison
----------------
If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye  
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry  
When waking from a bad dream  
Don't you sometimes think it's real?  
But it's only false emotions that you feel  
  
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long  
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song  
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky  
So let your hair down and go on and cry


this is the end of the song

Hurt
Carly Simon
----------------
Hurt to think that you lied to me  
Hurt way down deep inside of me  
You said your love was true and we'd never part  
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart  
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know  
Hurt because I still love you so  
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do  
I would never, never hurt you  
  
Hurt to think that you lied to me  
Hurt way down deep inside of me  
You said your love was true and we'd never part  
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart  
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know  
Hurt because I still love you so  
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do  
I would never, never hurt you

Kookachoo
Kylie Minogue
----------------
No-one else I know can thrill me like you do  
I only ever want to Go-Go dance with you  
You're the dreamboy on my bedroom poster  
Now we're on a rollercoaster ride  
  
Chorus  
You're the greatest gift that I could ever wish for  
And there's not a single thing I wouldn't give for a little time with you  
My Kookachoo  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
  
No-one else can take me to the highs like you  
You show me all the colours when I'm feeling blue  
You're the brightest shining lights on Broadway  
Pink in evening sunsets every day  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Even at night, when I'm sleeping  
You are all I'm ever dreaming of.

They looking at a pimp funny I'm Katt Williams  
Money mike, I gets money on the mic  
And some say I'm wild'n out  
Bacardi styling out, pushing seven digits dialing  
But I ain't gotta fucking choice  
My money talks in a Chris Tucker voice  
"and you know this man"  
You a stand up rapper, hip hop comedian  
I start laughing as soon as I put your cd in  
You joke, you joke, you kid, you kid  
Should have went to comedy central with the vids you did  
But OK, you b.e.t. only if its comic view  
Promise you I'm funny style I can be a comic too  
I'm Marty Mar, at a auty mar  
Cute snotty broad, tits like dolly par  
Ed harty naw this is carty ma  
But that was a good one, hardy har  
Lambo Galardi car getting my last laugh haw  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse: Pusha t's]  
The jokes on you niggas  
See the figures don't add up to the claims  
You Sam Kinnison you just screaming names  
My brother my partner for real like the wayans  
Plus everything in live in living color  
High rise checks diamonds the size of Robin Harris'  
I Bebe kids my neck  
You call it a tribute, a proof that I distribute  
Sales was slow I got Paco to contribute  
Some morals in each state, move weight, get caught, don't talk, Dave Chappelle
niggas might break  
So hilarious, how the chariots, carry us  
Phantom is light gray sort of like ashy Larry is  
King of the one liner lil' rhymers watch what you say  
You just a potty mouth like Andrew dice clay  
I pop collars on niggas, I drop dollars on niggas  
I jell o's together I bill Cosby on niggas  
Got you lost in the smoke I Micheal Connelly you niggas  
I watch u verse from the fire I Richard Pryor you niggas  
Said enough nigga sort of like Kramer  
I'm joking you don't wanna see the anger Fab tell'em  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
Mane look, the diamonds in your chain look  
Funnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi  
I am to fly, in the booth I  
Make joke of them, I ain't the richest nigga but I ain't broke as them  
I'm serious, petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph  
Girls get curious  
Is he really funny, don't be silly honey  
I'm the burner packing  
Bernie macing  
I ain't scared of you ma-fuckers kick ass  
Hon stack thick ass  
A deck of card v.i.p. section hard  
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads  
I'm popping rose, I don't the neck to god  
Don't front yo, I be in the front row  
Watch your wise cracks or I'll be at your front door  
And I push up on a female smoothly, in a GL but keep that on the D.L. Hughley  
Lol this is Los  
Oh no your money coming so slow guess this ma-fuckers a no show, oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]

Cadillac Red
Judds

Well she's washed and polished  
And full of high octane  
Ridin' with the top down  
Crusin' in the fast land  
Her red hairs blowin' bright as a flame  
Cadillac red's her name  
  
Cadillac red  
Singin' as she passes by  
Cadillac red  
See that hillbilly fly  
Catch her if you can  
She can out run any man  
Cadillac red  
  
Her radio's loud and she's rollin' to the back beat  
Her best girlfriends are piled in the backseat  
She's puttin' her lipstick on  
Cause' there's a Mustang blowin' his horn

Angel Baby
Linda Ronstadt
----------------
It's just like heaven  
Being here with you  
You're like an angel  
Too good to be true  
But after all I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
When you are near me  
My heart skips a beat  
I can hardly stand on  
My own two feet  
Because I love you I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
Ooh I love you, ooh I do  
No one could love you like I do  
Oh  
Oh Oh Oh  
Please never leave me  
Blue and alone  
If you ever go  
I'm sure you'll come back home  
Because I love you I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
Ooh I love you, ooh I do  
No one can love you like I do  
Oh

Wonderful
Christina Perri
----------------
Can't believe my eyes  
Could they possibly be deceiving me on the other side  
Of the picture screen your kissing  
Somebody  
  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
And she's nothing like me  
  
How long must I wait for my jealousy to take a break?  
You know it's so unlike me to secretly wanna fight with faith  
It's really you that I hate  
  
But I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
And she's nothing like me  
  
I wanna know what this means  
There remains a slate to be clean  
Please don't' let this, don't let become  
The death of me  
  
Forgive me  
Forgive me

Do You Know?
Xscape
----------------
Tocha, Kandi, Tiny, Tamika. You know the flava.  
Do you know what you do to me? [repeat x4]  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
Just when you think you know  
'Cause everybody's got someone that moves them in some way.  
I never thought it could happen to me, I couldn't see it,  
Until I met you, you set me free baby.  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
If this was a crush I would've been long over you, but I know it's more,  
'Cause you got me doing things I said I'd never do.  
Lie awake, beep-beep, I'm losing sleep, wanna see you again,  
I'm doing everything to let you know I wanna be more than friends.  
  
When it comes to you, I lose all my control,  
I let the situation get out of hand.  
'Cause when I'm not with you I wanna be by myself,  
Can't stand to see you with no one else,  
Baby, baby, that's the kind of thing you do to me.  
  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?

Squash
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
Headin' from El Paso  
Ridin' down the highway  
Look out my window  
What do I see  
Some armadillo done gone crazy  
Flew in front of semi  
Man, looks like squash to me  
  
Thinkin' 'bout my my baby  
Livin' down in Houston  
Wonder if that squashes armadillo too  
Guess I'll stop in Greenland  
And have me some ol' veggies  
This highway will do that to you  
  
I'm thinkin' Squash  
On the highway  
Coyote and Armadillo, Possum too  
I'm talkin' Squash  
Out on the highway  
Vitamin D and A and be Complex too  
I'm talkin' Squash  
  
Domestic Animals

If you promise to do your part  
I'll do mine too

Boogie Pilgrim
Elton John
----------------
Crime in the streets  
I read about it everyday in the papers  
Justice needs and justice wants  
But just in times, yes, too late here  
Feels like I wasn't born there  
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim  
  
Boogie Pilgrim  
Hustled to get it  
To get it together  
Down on the jive talk  
Down on the weather  
Boogie Pilgrim  
Brother I never felt better  
No, I never felt better  
  
Low life's complete  
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk  
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)  
I got the speed if you got the need  
But the need in me needs nothing  
(But you know that I need nothing)  
But I know that you all want something  
Just like Boogie Pilgrim

Talk To Me
Robbie Williams
----------------
Close the door, turn out the light  
There's something really wrong tonight with you  
Me and you  
  
You say you're too young to love  
And too old to hate  
Remote control keeps you awake  
So turn me on  
  
Maybe you could talk and make my day  
You don't have to walk away to  
Stay with me  
Make me change  
Answer me  
Break the chain  
  
News at Ten, Eastenders, and another cup of tea  
And then I fight  
Baby, not tonight  
  
'Cause I'm not dressed to be a clown  
I'm not in the mood for shouting out  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Do you keep your lover out of sight?  
'Cause you smell like someone else tonight  
All right all right  
  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me

Where Did I Lose Your Love
Journey
----------------
Desperately falling  
Feeling our love set us free  
We were better together  
Believed it was all meant to be  
Stay as one forever  
The band of gold would always prevail  
Happy in the moment  
Life betrays one, a fairytale  
Memories time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
What we shared was not enough  
Where did I lose your love  
  
Never saw it coming  
You left so suddenly  
What was here that scared you  
You want what I couldn't see  
Emotions time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
What we shared was not enough  
Where did I lose your love  
  
So far from each other  
So close to happiness  
I'll be there to remind you  
Love forgives but never forgets  
Emotions time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
  
How could I make you stay  
Where did I lose your love  
Still regret the night you walked away  
Oh, oh, yeah

(We're Not) The Jet Set
John Prine
----------------
By a fountain back in Rome I fell in love with you  
In a small cafe in Athens You said you loved me too  
And it was April in Paris when I first held you close to me  
Rome, Georgia, Athens, Texas And Paris, Tennessee  
  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
There's no Riviera  
In Festus, Missouri  
  
And you won't find Onassis  
In Mullinville, Kansas  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love  
  
No, We're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
Our steak and martinis  
Is draft beer with weenies  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love  
  
No, We're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
The Prine and DeMent set  
Ain't the flaming suzette set  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love

Never Let Me Go
Nat King Cole
----------------
Never let me go  
Love me much too much  
If you let me go  
Life will lose its touch  
What would I be without you?  
There's no place for me without you  
  
Never let me go  
I'd be so lost if you went away  
There'd be a thousand hours in a day without you  
I know  
  
Because of one caress my world was overturned  
at the very start  
All my bridges burned by my flaming heart  
You'd never leave me would you?  
You couldn't hurt me could you?  
  
Never let me go  
Never let me go

I Wish
Point Of Grace
----------------
To hold me closer or set me free  
To trust completely or let it be  
You don't know my destiny  
You can't see what I can see  
  
Hey, I wish I cared  
Hey, I wish I cared  
To love me truly or let me go  
In between I don't want to know  
  
This is how it has to be  
No more us and no more we  
Hey, I wish I cared  
Hey, I wish I cared  
  
Once again, on the station  
See your face in a crowd  
Comes again the sensation  
You can't hear yourself think  
  
With their voices inside your head  
Hey, I wish I cared  
Hey, I wish I cared  
I wish I cared  
  
Yes I really do  
I wish I cared  
(Hey) I wish I cared  
Yes I really do  
  
I wish I cared  
(Hey) I wish I cared  
I wish I cared

All By Myself
Air Supply
----------------
When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
Livin' alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
But when I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
Hard to be sure  
Sometimes I feel so insecure  
And love's so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore

Nice 'n Easy
Michael Buble
----------------
Let's take it nice and easy  
It's gonna be so easy  
For us to fall in love  
  
Hey baby what's your hurry  
Relax and don't you worry  
We're gonna fall in love  
  
We're on the road to romance - that's safe to say  
But let's make all the stops along the way  
  
The problem now of course is  
To simply hold your horses  
To rush would be a crime  
'Cause nice and easy does it every time  
  
We're on the road to romance - that's safe to say  
But let's make all the stops along the way  
  
The problem now of course is  
To simply hold your horses  
To rush would be a crime  
'Cause nice and easy does it  
'Cause nice and easy does it  
'Cause nice and easy does it every time  
  
Nice and easy does it  
Nice and easy does it  
Nice and easy does it every time

Trust In Me
Katy Perry
----------------
How could I see you when I was so blind  
How could I grasp you when I was far behind  
How could I hear you when I was so deaf  
How could I get up when I had been left  
  
But You said, "don't worry"  
For I've healed the blind man  
And I've set the captives free  
And You said, "don't worry"  
For all you've gotta do  
Is put your trust in Me  
  
How could I be clean  
When I was so dirty  
How could I be made whole  
When I was torn apart  
Make me whole, make me whole  
Make me whole again

A Christmas Carol
Christmas Songs
----------------
One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol.  
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time.  
However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends - of whom  
I have none, that in order to get a song popular by Christmas  
Time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here  
Goes.  
It has always seemed to me after all, that Christmas,  
With it's spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity  
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply  
Believe in - I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the  
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street,  
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we  
Celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial  
Spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol  
For next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.  
  
Christmas time is here, by golly  
Disapproval would be folly  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly  
Fill the cup and don't say when  
  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens  
Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens  
Even though the prospect sickens  
Brother, here we go again  
  
On Christmas Day you can't get sore  
Your fellow man you must adore  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four  
  
Relations, sparing no expense, 'll  
Send some useless old utensil  
Or a matching pen and pencil  
("Just the thing I need, how nice!")  
  
It doesn't matter how sincere it is  
Nor how heart felt the spirit  
Sentiment will not endear it  
What's important is the price  
  
Hark, the Herald Tribune sings  
Advertising wondrous things  
God rest ye merry merchants  
May ye make the Yuletide pay  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and - buy!  
  
So let the raucous sleighbells jingle  
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle  
Driving his reindeer across the sky  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by  
  
(Spoken)  
Actually I did rather well myself, this last Christmas.  
The nicest present I received was a gift certificate  
"Good at any hospital for a lobotomy"... rather thoughtful.

Jam Back At The House
Jimi Hendrix
----------------
Jimi:  
"yeah well a like I said before we only ran up a few numbers so let  
Me try and do this one like we were just jammin' at the house we don't have  
A name for yet it's just like an instrumental so we'll just go along with it.  
It goes somthin' like this."  
  
No lyrics. it's an insturmental like jimi said, but a great instrumental.  
  
Jimi:  
"before we go any further we'd like to say that you all really had a lot of
pashents  
Three days worth. you've prooved to the world what can happen with a little
bit of  
Love and sounds. oh, I left my girlfriend at home I'm sorry. I'd like to do a
thing  
That a new american anthem until we get another on together. this is called
'voodoo  
Child (slight return)'."

Such A Little Thing Makes Such A Big Difference
Morrissey
----------------
Such a little thing  
Such a little thing  
But the difference it made was grave  
There you go  
Wielding a bicycle chain  
Oh, why won't you change?  
Change and be nicer?  
  
Such a little thing  
A gentle tone of kindness  
Or written words on paper  
Can you write?  
  
How I love all of  
The very simple things of life  
(God's good air)  
How I love all of  
The very simple things of life  
  
Such a little thing  
A fumbling politeness  
The difference saved me  
Wielding a bicycle chain  
Why won't you change?  
"I will not change  
And I will not be nice"  
Most people keep their brains  
Between their legs  
(don't you find?)  
  
Leave me alone - I was only singing  
Leave me alone because  
I was only singing  
Leave me alone - I was only singing  
Leave me alone  
You have just proved (again)  
Most people keep their brains  
Between their legs

Indian Summer
Roy Orbison
----------------
You were a lady - like lady I was a boy running wild  
The way that you used everything that god gave you  
I gave you my heart like a child, one moment you took me to heaven  
Took me back to earth and then before I woke up to the fact I was small you
took me back to heaven again  
  
And I remember the Indian summer how you held me, how you loved me (Loved me
loved me)  
The world may give me a million reasons but reasons don't make it wrong  
Every lesson I learned has a price in return I was lost in my youth and to
tell you the truth  
I was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die  
Just to hear you that sees me through, oh what I'd give to re-live all the
Indian Summers with you  
  
So many hearts have been broken (Dum dumb dumb dumb-by Do Wah)  
You had no trouble with mine like a fool I was there for the taking (but then)  
It was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing  
Just knowing you've already paid but you can't live alone in an Indian Summer
at 110 in the shade  
  
And I remember (and I remember) The Indian Summer  
How you held me in the moonlight  
  
We were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head  
and if I'd known I'd lose you the moment I found you I'd love you all over
again  
  
'cause I'm still empty (I'm still empty) Come fill me ( Come fill me)  
With a fire of love your flame will follow flame 'cause it's all I want to do  
  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you-oooooooooooooooooo

Hallowed Point
Slayer
----------------
High velocity bullet at close range  
Can damage the mind  
Shattering the skull shredding the brain  
Severing the spine  
  
Bury a round of lead in the chest  
It's quite an impression  
Imagine the innards of your soul  
The infliction  
  
[Chorus]  
Instinctive regression  
With intent to kill  
No regard of human life  
Or the blood spilled  
  
Riddled convulsions  
Confetti of flesh  
Scattered helplessly  
Losing your control of physical  
Facilities  
  
Release the slide to cleanse inside  
Prepare to anoint  
Snap the tongue in the groove discharge  
To make my hallowed point  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The power of a gun  
Used with conviction  
Dispersed on excursions  
Randomly kills its victims  
  
My sweet revenge  
Bitter in depression  
The thrilling release  
Of a hatred deep persuasion  
  
The power of a gun  
Used with conviction  
Diffused compulsions  
Unending repercussions  
  
Violent emotion  
Screaming revolution  
Spasmic convulsions  
Death an empty gun

Just Woke Up
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
Behind a burning bush he's waiting  
Like a sleepless night  
So silent and so strong  
I know that I must push push push  
Until the morning light  
Don't make me wait too long  
  
Till I open my eyes  
Open the door  
Take a walk outside  
And feel the sun  
Fall on my skin  
It's time to get up  
But not time to give in  
I just woke up  
  
With eyes as cold as ice cream  
Floating in a frozen lake  
I have to set the spark  
And stroke the fire within him  
Oh I have to see him smile  
To have a happy heart  
  
I opened my eyes  
Walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes  
When I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
One day I just woke up  
I opened my eyes  
Opened the door took a walk outside  
And what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes when I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
Oh let me open my eyes  
Open the door and look up to the skies  
And leave the shore  
And let my hand trail in the cool water  
Float downstream, say goodbye to  
That dream--I just woke up  
  
I opened my eyes  
I walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my mind when I  
Opened the door--I just woke up

Hero
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
I don't want to be a hero  
I don't ever want to let you down  
No I don't want to let you down  
  
I can try to take you higher  
But I don't want to wear your broken crown  
You know it brings me down  
  
Don't think you'll ever understand me  
I don't even understand me  
Don't have the power to anoint you  
And I don't want to disappoint the fools no more  
The fools no more  
  
I couldn't answer all your questions  
And if you're lost I couldn't find the way  
I couldn't find your way  
  
You know you'll have to face the music  
You change your tune, you don't know what to play  
So don't you run away  
  
Everybody's talking crazy  
So think I am a devil maybe  
I don't want to hear about it  
Don't want to have to scream and shout it  
  
Fools no more  
The fools no more  
  
So I don't want to be a hero  
Don't want to sit upon your crippled thrown  
I've got a life of my own  
  
I am not your destination  
Or a road that's gonna lead you home  
So baby please don't go  
  
Please don't go  
Please don't go  
Please don't go...

Blue Turns To Grey
Rolling Stones
----------------
So now that she is gone  
You won't be sad for long  
For maybe just an hour or just a moment  
Of the day  
  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just don't feel good  
You don't feel alright  
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her  
  
You think you'll have a ball  
And you won't care at all  
You'll find another girl or maybe more  
To pass the time away  
  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just don't feel good  
You just don't feel alright  
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her  
  
She's not home when you call  
So you can go to all  
The places where she used to go  
But she has gone away  
  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just don't feel good  
You don't feel alright  
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her  
  
Blue turns to grey (blue turns to grey)  
She has gone away (blue turns to grey)  
I feel so bad (blue turns to grey)  
I wish you'd come on home (blue turns to grey)  
I feel, I feel so down...

Gotta Get Away
Rolling Stones
----------------
Baby, the truth is out so don't deny  
Baby to think I believed all your lies  
Darlin' I can't stand to see your face  
It's the truth, you understand  
I got to get away, got to get away  
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away  
Got to get away  
  
Baby, I don't want to live here no more  
Baby, though I tore your pictures off my walls  
Darlin' this old room's falling in on me  
You understand the truth now  
I got to get away, got to get away  
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away  
Got to get away  
  
Baby, oh, how could you take away your clothes  
Baby, don't screw up this old heart of gold  
Darling, this will rule my social flare  
You understand me now  
I got to get away, got to get away  
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away  
Got to get away

It's Only Us
Robbie Williams
----------------
And they want us to grow up  
We don't want to get a job  
We all need a decent rock  
Where it's all kicking off  
  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
You don't need to call it off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
It's only us  
  
We just stopped for cheaper thrills  
Since the price went up on pills  
From Stoke-on-Trent to Beverley hills  
  
We know it's all kicking off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
You don't need to call it off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
It's only us  
It's only us  
  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
You don't need to call it off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
It's only us  
It's only us

No One
Ray Charles
----------------
(I need someone to say I do)  
No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight  
No one to tell my troubles to  
  
I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me  
Tight  
No one to cheer me when I'm blue  
  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
One prayer  
  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you  
  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
One prayer  
  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you

Breath Of Heaven
Donna Summer
----------------
And Gabriel appeared to Mary and said  
"Do not be afraid Mary  
You have found favor with god  
You will be with child  
And give birth to a son  
And you are to give him the name Jesus  
He will be great  
And will be called the son of the most high  
And the lord god will give him the throne of his father David  
And he will reign over the house of David forever  
His kingdom will never end"  
  
I have traveled many moonless night  
Cold and weary with a babe inside  
And I wonder what I've done  
Holy father you have come  
And chosen me now to carry your son  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone  
Must I walk this path alone  
Be with me now  
Be with me now  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For your are holy  
Breath of heaven  
  
Do you wonder as you watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be  
Help me  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven

Flying Fishmonger
Phineas And Ferb
----------------
Holy Holy Mackerel (4x)  
He's bald on top  
He's got an artificial hip  
He's gonna take a hop  
He's gonna take a trip  
He's weak in the knees  
And he can't find his keys  
But put your hands together  
Cause he's here to please  
He's a Flying Fishmonger (Flying Fishmonger)  
He's a Flying Fishmonger (Death-defying wonder)  
He's a Flying Fishmonger with nerves of steel  
He's got an old bundle motor  
And a pair of wheels

Hearts
Yes
----------------
Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love you  
  
Set your heart sail on the river  
Look around you as you drift downstream Hearing  
Pouring souls into the ocean Talking  
Take account of all you've seen Love you  
  
One people - Together  
Freedom for today  
So easy the future  
So see the children's way  
  
Love me  
Teach me  
Know me  
  
One people - Together  
Freedom for today  
Tomorrow forever  
So see the people's way  
  
Many moons cascade one river  
They light from side to side  
As we cross in close proximity  
Like rivers our hearts entwine  
How we talk - How we teach our children  
How we move - We direct our eyes  
All the senses tuned discovery  
As and as and when our hearts decide  
Be ready now - Be ye circle  
Be the central force ye life  
As the game extends the cycle  
Be ready to move  
  
One heart's for love Hearts  
One's for giving Sailing down the river  
Two hearts are better Hearts  
Than one Throwing out a line  
I hearing it Hearts  
I living it  
I believe in it Sharing out your fortunes  
Two hearts are better Hearts  
Than one In and out of time  
  
Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love you

Than one Throwing out a line  
I hearing it Hearts  
I living it  
I believe in it Sharing out your fortunes  
I loving it  
Two hearts are better Hearts  
Than one In and out of time  
  
Who would believe you - Wise men do  
Days that we knew it clear with you  
You sing the answers question time  
Now it you need me let our hearts entwine  
Let our hearts entwine  
  
Hearts - Sailing down the river  
Hearts - Throwing out a line  
I hearing it - I living it - I believe in it - I loving it

Two hearts will always be  
In and out of time

Two hearts are better Hearts  
Than one In and out of time  
  
As we flow down life's rivers  
I see the star glow - One by one  
All angels of the magic constellation  
Be singing us now

Lazy River
Louis Armstrong
----------------
Up a lazy river by the old mill stream  
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream  
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree  
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along  
Blue skies up above ....everyone's in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now  
Up a lazy river with me  
  
(instrumental break)  
  
Up a lazy river by the old mill run  
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun  
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree  
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along  
There are blue skies up above...and as long as we're in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be  
If you go up a lazy river with me  
Ah said with me now.....goin'up that... lazy river..... with me

Elephants And Flowers
Prince
----------------
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night  
He's looking for some action, he's looking 4 a fight  
He's looking for a savior in a city full of fools  
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking to.  
Can we talk baby? Strip down, strip down.  
I think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.  
  
Elephants and flowers, hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold  
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls  
How can he find a shy angel in a city so bold (so bold)  
He can't even find a place to dance, this is rock and roll.  
Strip down, strip down, elephants and flowers  
Is everybody ready? Here we go.  
  
Love the one who is love, (love) the one who gives us the power, (power)  
The one who made everything, (what?) elephants and flowers (what will he do?)  
The one who will listen when all others will not.  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot.  
  
Elephants and flowers, strip down.  
Think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.  
When I do, there won't be no more (confusion)  
There won't be no more (no tears)  
There won't be no more enemies, so that eliminates all the fear  
And there won't be no sorrow, (sorrow)  
There won't be no pain, (no pain)  
There won't be no ball and no chain  
Strip down, strip down, elephants and flowers.  
  
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night  
He's looking for an angel to hold him 'til the morning light  
Here we go.  
  
Love the one who is love, (well) the one who gives us the power, (power)  
The one who made everything, (everything) elephants and flowers (oh, yeah)  
The one who will listen when all others will not. (all others will not)  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot.  
Here we go.  
  
Love the one who is love, (love) the one who gives us the power, (power)  
The one who made everything, (what?) elephants and flowers (what will he do?)  
The one who will listen when all others will not.  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot.

Macgillycuddy's Reeks
Warren Zevon
----------------
She stood beside my narrow bed  
To check my E.K.G.  
She shook her pretty little head  
At what's become of me  
  
I thought I glimpsed a path that led  
Through rhododendron days  
And fuchsia nights to the boat-shed  
In which we two once lay  
  
But she gazed only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
But she gazed only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
I saw her on Killarney's shore  
One morning in July  
When I still thought I was a thorn  
Trying to find a side  
  
I met her in the little launch  
That runs to Innisfallen  
Hunched together, haunch to haunch  
Trying to keep my balance  
  
But she upset my applecart  
She kissed me on the cheek  
And I was struck by Cupid's dart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
I was struck by Cupid's dart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
She was a systems analyst  
For a dot com company  
She said, "You think because we've kissed  
I'll be yours eternally  
  
I'll sign another pre-nup  
And we'll merge our P.L.C.s  
that's why most girls go belly-up  
In this economy  
  
But when it comes to a jump start  
Your forecast's pretty bleak  
The NASDAQ goes by dips and starts  
Like Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
The NASDAQ goes by dips and starts  
Like Macgillycuddy's Reeks"  
  
She looked only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
That was the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks

He Needs Me
Nina Simone
----------------
He needs me  
He doesn't know it, but he needs me  
And so no matter where he goes  
Though he doesn't care  
He knows that I'm here  
  
He needs me  
I ought to leave him, but he needs me  
I know that I ain't very bright  
Just to tag along  
Oh, but right or wrong  
I'm his and I'm here  
And I'm gonna be his friends or his lover  
  
Cause my one ambition is  
To wake him and make him discover  
That he needs me  
Ive got to follow where he leads me  
Or else hell never know that I need him  
Just as he needs me

In For The Kill
Electric Light Orchestra
----------------
Listen to the money talk  
Listen to it scream  
Only lots of paper  
But it haunts them in their dreams.  
  
Doesn't matter who they are  
Doesn't matter where  
Some people can't get enough  
That is their only care.  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill.  
  
Sitting in a darkened room  
Sharing out the land  
Someone holds a document  
And smiles as they shake hands.  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill.  
  
Everywhere you wander,  
Wander where you will  
Someone's making deals  
And going in for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill...

My Life
Donna Summer
----------------
When I was young  
I used to dream of going far  
Having my once in a lifetime  
Chance to prove I was a star  
A thousand times I stood in  
The wings dreaming it was me  
I heard the people going wild  
But it was just my fantasy  
Life is a dance  
Maybe we're all players  
So stand up and smile  
And don't be afraid  
  
This is my night  
This is my song  
Standing right here out on  
The stage is where I belong  
  
This is my song  
This is my night  
Standing right here out on  
The stage in the spotlight  
Whoo hoo  
  
I traveled the road  
Wherever the road would lead  
I made mistakes  
But I wouldn't quit  
I made myself believe  
Dreams come true for those who  
Dream, so one day you can say  
If the music be the fruit of life  
Then let my music play  
  
Life is a dance  
Maybe we're all players  
So stand up and smile  
And don't you be afraid  
  
This is my life  
This is my song  
Standing right here out on  
The stage is where I belong  
  
This is your life  
This is my song  
This is my life  
Standing right here out on  
The stage in the spotlight

Bitter Green
Gordon Lightfoot
----------------
Upon the Bitter Green she walked the hills above the town  
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown  
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears  
Waiting through the years  
  
[Chorus]  
Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met  
Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun  
Waiting for someone to take her home  
  
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea  
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust  
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
[Chorus]

Krack Rock's
Kid Rock
----------------
Who are you, who are you  
Well I'm the punk with the pump in the back of my pack  
How you step rock  
I step in stride  
  
I step across stage with my nuts in my hand  
The punks want to front cause I got my own band  
Goddamn I'm the man with the helly buzz  
And my shit don't stink, like eli's does  
  
I'm a pleasure girls man from what I heard  
Nah man, I kicked that bitch to the curb  
I don't really need to be tied down  
I'm a ramblin man, and I'm platinum bound  
  
Me too, rolled my crew, I'm not too new  
.16 is what I blew  
I bet that set you straight, that illegal action  
Fuck that, I still roll with a 40 in my lap  
  
Back in 2nd grade, I carried a lunch box  
Turned 21 started smokin crack pots  
Snortin that D by the dime  
Wish I could slow down, I'm ahead of my time  
  
I'm the Krack, I'm the Krack  
Krack, Krack, Krack  
I'm the Krack bitch, my last dimes what I'm bettin  
I'm up in the casino with a flash like stetson  
  
Girls all stare, they gauck, they sneer  
So I grab me a bitch and I slapped her in the rear  
My livingroom is the place I'm hangin out  
Uptight pussy's is the shit I'm bangin out  
  
I'm sick of livin in these perplex times  
That's why I kick these motherfuckin sex rhymes  
  
I'm headin down south  
I'm headin down south  
I'm headin down, headin down  
  
Hip hip hip hip diggin exactly where you go  
I'm headin down south on a dusty path  
I got a cool ass buzz and an empty flask  
Ass on the wagon and they think I'm all soft  
  
But I don't givea fuck, I'm trippin my balls off  
Up in the crack house tunin them rocks off  
Hoe's come around an we be knockin the box top  
Knocked out, knocked up and all that shit  
  
Hot wax, sweaty spot, lickin spit from your clit  
Everything that gets old  
It get's over rated  
Old to me, just means out dated  
  
I'm the Kid Rock, fuck all that 60's shit  
Take Woodstock and shove it up your momma's clit  
Oh shit, and there it is  
I get a lot of pussy cause I'm in show biz  
  
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house  
I wished for a kiss and your mom popped out.  
Put her hands on her flop and started eyein me  
So I smacked the ole bitch with my flyin D  
  
That's when I said "man I gotta get a grip"  
Looked at the TV realized I was trippin  
  
It ain't no party like a Detroit party  
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop  
I said It ain't no party like a Detroit party  
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop  
  
It ain't no party like a Detroit party  
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop  
I said It ain't no party like a Detroit party  
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop

Out Of Control
Tears For Fears
----------------
Goodbye desperado  
If they hadn't sucked out all the poison  
From your veins you'd be dead by now  
Too late frida kahlo  
You could have the power of the phoenix  
And the flame if you knew just how  
  
Come the hour  
Come the mantra  
Repeat in defeat with the pots and the pans  
Walk away  
Walk on water  
They're young then they're old then they don't give a damn  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Sleepless situation  
Shaken by the clatter of the clinking  
On the bars of your private jail  
Twisted ultimatum  
Searching for a lifeline or a band aid  
For your sins in the morning mail  
  
Tow the line  
Floating islands  
They're here and they're now but they're oceans away  
Tie them down  
Baby lions  
You'll bleed and you'll plead and you'll beg them to stay  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Don't be afraid now  
Your cover is blown  
Don't shed a tear now  
Your babies are grown

And aim it at your turtle shell

My niggas they trained to kill  
We got bananas  
You know they gone peel

Can't Help Falling In Love
Bon Jovi
----------------
Wise men say only fools rush in  
but I can't help falling in love with you  
Shall I stay  
would it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
some things are meant to be  
take my hand, take my whole life too  
  
for I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
some things are meant to be  
take my hand, take my whole life too  
for I can't help falling in love with you  
for I can't help falling in love with you

Drifting Too Far
Emmylou Harris
----------------
Out on the perilous deep,  
Where danger silently creeps,  
And storm's so violently sweeping,  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Chorus:  
Drifting too far from shore,  
You're drifting too far from shore,  
Come to Jesus today,  
Let Him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Today, the Tempest rose high,  
And clouds o'er shadow the sky.  
Sure death is hovering neigh,  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Drifting too far from shore,  
You're drifting too far from shore,  
Come to Jesus today,  
Let Him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Why meet a terrible fate?  
Mercies abundantly wait.  
Turn back before it's too late  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Drifting too far from shore  
You're drifting too far from shore (peaceful shore)  
Come to Jesus today. Let him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore...

We All Want Love
Rihanna
----------------
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all  
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all  
  
I can pretend that I'm not lonely  
But I'll be constantly fooling myself  
I can pretend that it don't matter  
But I'll be sitting here lying to myself  
Some say love ain't worth the buck  
But I'll give every dime I have left  
To have what I've only been dreaming about  
  
Everybody wants something  
Better want something  
What are you living for?  
Everybody needs something  
Fighting for something  
I know what you're fighting for  
'Cause we all  
  
We all want someone there to hold  
We just want somebody  
We all wanna be somebody's one and only  
We all wanna be warm when it's cold  
Yeah yeah yeah  
No one wants to be left scared and lonely

We all want the same thing  
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all  
We all want the same thing

We all want the same thing  
Everybody wants something  
Gotta want something  
Yeah, yeah we all want love  
  
I'm able to close my eyes  
Yet my heart's not so blind  
I feel so entitled of owes me  
I want what's mine  
  
And some say love ain't worth the buck  
But I'll give 'em the last dime  
To have what I've only been dreaming about

Baby's Breath
Pretenders
----------------
There was a time you thought  
I was in love with you  
Well think again,  
You can't read my thought  
You're so pretty,  
I'd like to break your smile in two  
You're so correct,  
I'd like to disconnect the dots  
You're such a child,  
But you're not innocent  
Another kid for rent  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath  
  
There was a time I thought  
You were magnificent  
But you've got nothing to have or to hold  
You're so pensive  
But your thoughts are insignificant  
Wrap 'em up another twenty billion sold  
You think you're wild and you know  
What danger means  
In your designer jeans  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath  
  
I'd like to have you alone tonight  
And rearrange your mind  
I'd like to have you  
But I know I'd be wasting my time  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath

Chasing The Rainbow
America
----------------
Sat here thinking about my heart  
All of the places it came apart  
There's just one thing that I need to know  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uh huh  
I ran through the meadow looking for a dream  
Truth is never like what it seems  
I guess there's always so far to go  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Where is the light  
Where is the love  
Where are the dreams that I once had  
Frittered away  
Gone in the time it takes to get from there to here  
Get it get it get it  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
I'd draw you a picture cause it just might help  
To point out the place where we went so wrong  
The only color I'd use is blue  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow

Way Down Here
Kenny Chesney
----------------
Put off the mail and I  
Left on a light and I  
Locked up the house and I  
Jumped on a flight and I'm  
Still by myself but I'm  
Thinking more clear if I'm  
Gonna be down, gonna be down way down here  
  
[Chorus]  
Where no one will ask cause nobody knows  
That you're not in my life anymore  
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears  
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves  
Ain't gonna wash your memory away  
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier  
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here  
  
Untied my lines and I  
Slid through the sound and I  
Mixed me a drink now I  
Sit on the bow and I'm  
Watching the sun just like you'll disappear  
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves  
Ain't gonna wash your memory away  
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier  
And if I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down  
If I'm gonna be down, I'd rather be down way down here  
Way down here  
  
If you want me back now  
I can be found  
Way down here  
If I'm gonna be down  
If I'm gonna be down  
Way down here

Linkin Park

Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right  
There's a whole in me, that I can't fill, no matter how hard I try  
Hey, hey, hey bartender, hit me with a double  
And introduce me to that girl with the bobble

It keeps me moving on

Suddenly
Leann Rimes
----------------
It's Independence Day I'm free  
And it's a strange place to be  
I'm gonna break these chains  
Unleash the changes in me  
  
I see an endless road  
I feel the restless wind  
I've lost the fear inside  
Cause I've got no choice  
But to live or die  
  
[Chorus]  
Suddenly you're in this fight  
Alone  
Steppin' out into the great  
Unknown  
And the night's the hardest  
Time  
When the doubts run through  
Your mind  
Cause suddenly you find your  
Self alone  
Suddenly you find yourself  
  
In an empty room  
With a suitcase on the floor  
It'll be daylight soon  
I'm gonna wage my private  
War  
  
Who's watchin' over me  
Must be a guardian angel  
I just need time to breathe  
And give my life  
The best of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly you're in this fight  
Steppin' out and then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly you're in this fight  
Alone  
Steppin' out into the great  
Unknown  
And the night's the hardest  
Time  
When the doubts run through  
Your mind  
Cause suddenly you find your  
Self alone  
Suddenly I found myself

I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me
Louis Armstrong
----------------
Oh, your eyes of blue  
Your kisses too  
I never knew what they could do  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
  
Yes, you're telling everyone I know  
I'm on your mind each time you go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me, oh yeah  
  
Oh baby, I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe you're in love with me

Long cool fingeroos  
Soft tenderloin touch  
  
Chorus  
  
City sidewalk shining wet with rain  
Run through the run through one more again  
Run through the jungle  
Fetch a lady's glove  
Kicking off a bundle  
Go on and give it a shove  
Speak up don't mumble  
Who do you love

I WOULD SAIL AROUND THE WORLD  
LOOK FOR GOLD AND DIVE FOR PEARL  
BUT I KNOW I WILL NEVER GET TO GO  
I WOULD LIKE TO WIN A PRIZE, BE IN EVERYBODY'S EYES  
BUT IT'S TRUE, I WOULD PROBABLY NOT GET TO  
  
MY LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SIMPLE  
NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHEN I COME AND GO  
AND MY DREAMS ARE ENDING AT SUNRISE  
AND DREAMING JUST DON'T MAKE IT SO  
  
SO I'VE LIVED WITHOUT REGRETS  
WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING AND YET  
NOW AND THEN, WISH THAT I COULD START AGAIN

But, darling, I know  
I'm a fool to care  
  
I'm a fool to cry  
Since you told me goodbye  
Oh, you can't be true  
So what can I do  
I'm a fool to care  
(I'm a fool to care)  
  
I know I should laugh, ha ha  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
I'm a fool to care  
When you don't care for me  
Why should I pretend  
I know I'll lose in the end  
I'm a fool to care  
  
I know I should laugh  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
I'm a fool to care  
When you don't care for me  
So why should I pretend  
I'll lose in the end  
Oh, I'm a fool to care

Calling My Children Home
Emmylou Harris
----------------
Those lives were mine to love and cherish  
To guard and guide along life's way  
Oh God forbid that one should perish  
That one alas should go astray  
Back in the years with all together  
Around the place we'd romp and play  
So lonely now I oft' times wonder  
Oh will they come back home some day  
  
I'm lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling, calling  
and come back home some day  
  
I gave my all for my dear children  
Their problems still with love I share,  
I'd brave life's storm, defy the tempest  
To bring them home from anywhere  
I lived my life my love I gave them,  
to guide them through this world of strife,  
I hope and pray we'll live together  
In that great glad here after life  
  
I'm lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling, calling  
and come back home some day

The Fuse
Jackson Browne
----------------
It's coming from so far away  
It's hard to say for sure  
Whether what I hear is music or the wind  
Through an open door  
There's a fire high in the empty sky  
Where the sound meets the shore  
There's a long distance loneliness  
Rolling out over the desert floor  
  
And the years that I spent lost in the mystery  
Fall away leaving only the sound of the drum  
Like a part of me  
It speaks to the heart of me  
Forget what life used to be  
You are what you choose to be  
It's whatever it is you see  
That life will become  
  
Whatever it is you might think you have  
You have nothing to lose  
Through every dead and living thing  
Time runs like a fuse  
And the fuse is burning  
And the earth is turning  
  
Though the years give way to uncertainty  
And the fear of living for nothing strangles the will  
There's a part of me  
That speaks to the heart of me  
Though sometimes it's hard to see  
It's never far from me  
Alive in eternity  
That nothing can kill  
  
Oh Lord  
Are there really people starving still?  
Look out beyond the walls of Babylon  
How long will their needs go unfilled  
I want to say right now I'm going to be around  
I'm going to be around  
When the walls and towers are crumbling  
When the towers are tumbling down  
And I will tune my spirit to the gentle sound  
I want to hear the sound  
Of the waters lapping on a higher ground  
Of the children laughing

Strongest Weakness
Etta James
----------------
I smoked my last cigarette  
Threw that nasty habit away  
Laid down my last dollar on my last bet  
Didn't ever win anyway  
  
Gave up the wine and whiskey  
'Cause everybody said I should  
But I'm givin' up on quittin' you, baby  
'Cause it feels so damn good  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know it's wrong but I can't go on  
  
And I try, try, try  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
My strongest weakness  
  
You been runnin' around for a long time now  
I know all the games you play  
Sooner or later you will put me down  
Gonna have to face it someday  
  
But baby, every time you hold me  
And I get another taste of your kiss  
I feel a power comin' over me  
That my body just can't miss  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know it's wrong but I can't go on  
  
I try, try, try,  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
My strongest weakness  
  
Why can't you just say no?  
(Strongest weakness)  
I said why can't I let you go?  
(Strongest weakness)  
  
Why, why do I keep, keep breakin' down?  
(Strongest weakness)  
I said why can't I turn around?  
(Strongest weakness)  
  
You know I try, try, try  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
I give in to you, baby  
You are my strongest weakness  
  
(Strongest weakness)  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
(Deepest secret)  
Deepest secret  
  
(Strongest weakness)  
Strongest weakness  
(Deepest secret)  
You are, you are  
(Strongest weakness)

Freedom 90
Enrique Iglesias
----------------
I won't let you down  
I will not give you up  
Gotta have some faith in the sound  
It's the one good thing that I've got  
I won't let you down  
So please don't give me up  
Because I would really, really love to stick around  
  
Heaven knows I was just a young boy  
Didn't know what I wanted to be  
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy  
And I guess it was enough for me  
To win the race? A prettier face!  
Brand new clothes and a big fat place  
On your rock and roll TV  
But today the way I play the game is not the sameNo way  
Think I'm gonna get me some happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I told you so  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone else I've got to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Take back your singing in the rain  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy  
What a kick just a buddy and me  
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy  
We were living in a fantasy  
We won the race  
Got out of the place  
I went back home got a brand new face  
For the boys on MTV  
But today the way I play the game has got to change  
Oh yeah  
Now I'm gonna get myself happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I stopped the show  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone I forgot to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Don't think that I'll be back again  
I just hope you understandSometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Well it looks like the road to heaven  
But it feels like the road to hell  
When I knew which side my bread was buttered  
I took the knife as well  
Posing for another picture  
Everybody's got to sell  
But when you shake your ass  
They notice fast  
And some mistakes were built to last  
  
That's what you get  
  
I say that's what you get  
  
That's what you get for changing your mind  
  
And after all this time  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes  
Do not make the man  
  
I'll hold on to my freedom  
May not be what you want from me  
Just the way it's got to be  
Lose the face nowI've got to live

You Not Me
Dream Theater
----------------
Being 'round you is driving me crazy  
Watching you run is making me lazy  
You're trying to buy a place in my head  
Telling me lines I've already read  
Speaking my name to try to confuse me  
Say it again you're starting to lose me  
  
That's alright, I'm okay  
It happens every single day  
It's all the same  
But I'm not blind  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
You're building my prison brick by brick  
Eating your words is making me sick  
You get what you want 'cause nothing is sacred  
You're reading my mind and leaving me naked  
You say I gotta give before I receive it  
One of these days I'll believe it  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
  
That's alright, I'm okay  
It happens every single day  
It's all the same  
But I'm not blind  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me

Bridge Over Troubled Water
Perry Como
----------------
When you're weary, feeling small,  
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all,  
I'm at your side,  
Oh! When times get rough,  
And friends just can't be found . . .  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
When you're down an' out, when you're on the street,  
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you,  
I'll take your part,  
Oh! When darkness comes,  
And pain is all around . . .  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
Sail on silver girl, sail on by,  
Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way,  
See how they shine,  
Oh! When you need a friend,  
I'm sailing right behind . . .  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will ease your mind!  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will ease your mind!  
Words and Music by Paul Simon

Crazy Arms
Waylon Jennings
----------------
Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time  
  
So take all the treasured dreams I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday these crazy arms may hold somebody new  
But for I'm just lonesome all the time  
Crazy arms that reach  
  
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time

I Still Love You
Reo Speedwagon
----------------
I was with you, you were alone  
Now I'm standing here  
Wisdom came only after you'd gone  
Now I'm starting all over, with a tear in my eye  
I just never thought you'd disappear  
  
In the night your spirit arises  
With it comes the pain  
I hope I'm dreaming 'cause it hurts so bad  
When I reach out for you, I'm alone in some room  
I just never thought you'd disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasn't that good enough?  
I still want you, it drive me wild  
The pain is just too much  
Maybe I've lost enough  
  
Time heals all, so they say, I don't know  
Sometimes nothing's clear  
Maybe someday I'll understand  
But I know for a start  
There's a place in my hear that is yours  
And it won't disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasn't that good enough?  
I still want you, It drives me wild  
The pain is just too much  
I still love you

Ants Marching
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
He wakes up in the morning  
Does his teeth, bite to eat and he's rolling  
Never changes a thing  
The week ends, the week begins  
  
She thinks, we look at each other  
Wondering what the other is thinking  
But we never say a thing  
And these crimes between us grow deeper  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  
  
Goes to visit his mommy  
She feeds him well his concerns he forgets them  
And remembers being small  
Playing under the table and dreaming  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  
  
Driving along this highway  
All these cars and upon the sidewalk  
People in every direction  
No words exchanged, no time to exchange  
  
When all the little ants are marching  
Red and black antennae waving  
They all do it the same  
They all do it the same way  
  
Candyman tempting the thoughts of a sweet tooth  
Tortured by weight loss  
Program cutting corners  
Loose end, loose end  
Cut, cut on the fence not to offend  
Cut, cut, cut ,cut  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  
  
Lights down you up and die

Empty Bed, Empty Heart
Gary Numan
----------------
You let me down  
How cold love can be  
I've nothing more to lose  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I don't sleep without you  
Empty bed, empty heart  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and I'll wait for you  
Years and years and years  
How strange love can be  
It bends and tears and screams  
But only here inside me  
But only here inside me  
I don't live without you  
There's nothing I can do  
I'm waiting always waiting  
I'm waiting oh but don't leave me now  
I'm here forever  
You don't come  
You don't come forever

I'm Carrying
Paul McCartney
----------------
By dawn's first light I'll come back to your room again  
With my carnation hidden by the packages  
I'm carrying, something  
I'm carrying something for you  
  
Ah, long time no see baby sure has been a while  
And if my reappearance lacks a sense of style  
I'm carrying, something  
I'm carrying something for you  
  
I'm carrying.  
I'm carrying, can't help it.  
  
I'm carrying.  
I'm carrying something for you.

Ride With Idol
Richard Marx
----------------
Try to remember those ancient evenings  
When all we had was just enough.  
Now the pretender knows why the king is screaming.  
The grief was finally just too much.  
  
I'm going to ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame.  
  
Over my shoulder, I know they're waiting.  
Their dirty hands are everywhere.  
And as they get closer all the pretense is fading.  
The face beneath the skin is bare.  
  
So now I ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage, oh yeah.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame.  
  
I can never learn to say no.  
Wont they ever let me go?  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
I'm going to ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage. Oh yeah, yeah.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame.  
Ride with the idol,  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage. Oh yeah, yeah.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame (fade)

Parasite
Nick Drake
----------------
Lifting the mask from from a local clown  
Feeling down like him  
Seeing the light in a station bar  
And travelling far in sin  
Sailing downstairs to the northern line  
Watching the shine of the shoes  
And hearing the trial of the people there  
Who's to care if they lose.  
And take a look you may see me on the ground  
For I am the parasite of this town.  
  
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes  
A sign of the times today  
And hearing no bell from a steeple tall  
People all in dismay  
Falling so far on a silver spoon  
Making the moon for fun  
And changing a rope for a size too small  
People all get hung.  
Take a look and see me coming through  
For I am the parasite who travels two by two.  
  
When lifting the mask from a local clown  
And feeling down like him  
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar  
And travelling far in sin  
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line  
Watching the shine of the shoes  
And hearing the trials of the people there  
Who's to care if they lose.  
And take a look you may see me on the ground  
For I am the parasite of this town.  
And take a look you may see me in the dirt  
For i am the parasite who hangs from your skirt.

Peace (Saudade)
Extreme
----------------
Heavy is the burden  
That brings you  
To your knees  
Lost in the confusion  
Of life's uncertainties  
Feel you're suffocating  
With every breath you take  
Moment left remaining  
Time for you to pray  
Time for you to pray  
  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
  
Whirl wind  
She's a-turning  
The river's  
On the rise  
Suddenly surrounded  
In the middle  
Middle of her eye  
Light precedes  
The thunder trembles  
Trembles and it shakes  
The ground your feet  
Are under  
Time for you to pray  
Time for you to pray  
  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace

On Every Corner
Doobie Brothers
----------------
Brother, you've fallen far behind.  
What is it that's on your mind?  
Sister, oh how do you decide?  
What do you see through your clouded eyes?  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
Brother, you've fallen to your knees.  
What do your children need?  
The distance is never out of reach,  
There's only inches between you and me.  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know  
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today.  
Count up the corners of 'em, add up the dollars for 'em.  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know,  
Ten thousand of 'em all over town.  
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today,  
But is it really helpin', whatever I do?  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' at you, you know  
Will I feel good about it, will I feel a fool?  
I hate to beg, 'cause I feel like such a fool?  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?

Frosty The Snow Man
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
Frosty the Snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Is a fairytale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic  
  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away  
Down to the village  
  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square  
Saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town  
  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler stop  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day  
Thumpety thump thump  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow

Somebody stalled the judge's ragged old gown Big Daddy's Alabamy bound

They got their hound dogs sniffin' the ground Big Daddy's Alabamy bound

Let's See Action
Eppu Normaali
----------------
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's see freedom, let's see who cares,  
Take me with you when you leave me  
And my shell behind us there.  
  
I have learned it, known who burned me,  
Avatar has warmed my feet,  
Take me with you, let me see you,  
Time and life can meet.  
  
Nothing is everything, everything is, nothing is,  
Please the people, audiences,  
Break the fences,  
Nothing is.  
  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's see freedom up in the air,  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's be free, let's see who cares.  
  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's see freedom up in the air,  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's be free, let's see who cares.  
  
Give me a drink boy, wash my feet,  
I'm so tired of running from my own heat,  
Take this package and here's what you do,  
Gonna get this information through.  
  
I don't know where I'm going,  
I don't know what I need,  
But I'll get to where I'm gonna end up,  
And that's alright by me.  
  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's see freedom up the air,  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's be free, let's see who cares.  
  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's see freedom in the air,  
Let's see action, let's see people,  
Let's be free, let's see who cares.  
  
Nothing is everything, everything is nothing.

Comfortably Numb
David Bowie
----------------
Hello,  
Is there anybody in there  
Just nod if you can hear me  
Is there anyone home?  
Come on, now  
I hear you're feeling down  
I can ease your pain  
Get you on your feet again  
Relax  
I'll need some information first  
Just the basic facts  
Can you show me where it hurts?  
  
There is no pain, you are receding  
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon  
You are only coming through in waves  
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying  
When I was a child I had a fever  
My hands felt just like two balloons  
Now I've got that feeling once again  
I can't explain, you would not understand  
This is not how I am  
I have become comfortably numb  
  
O. K.  
Just a little pin prick  
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!  
But you may feel a little sick  
Can you stand up?  
I do believe it's working, good  
That'll keep you going through the show  
Come on it's time to go.  
  
There is no pain, you are receding  
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon  
You are only coming through in waves  
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying  
When I was a child  
I caught a fleeting glimpse  
Out of the corner of my eye  
I turned to look, but it was gone  
I cannot put my finger on it now  
The child is grown  
The dream is gone  
I have become comfortably numb.

Gabriel
Mary Black
----------------
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Heaven knows I love you  
And heaven knows how true  
I'd be for you  
  
People have their failings  
And I know that I've got mine  
I know I've been ungrateful  
I know I've been unkind  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh come on Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Down into the valleys  
And out across the sea  
Our dreams go  
Caught up in a loving  
So much stronger than we knew  
That could tear our world apart  
Or with some fate just pull us through  
  
Gabriel oh Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Time will wait for no one  
And time will take it's toll  
And we'll grow old  
Weary from the fighting  
Worn out from a war  
Where no one can surrender  
Or wants to fight anymore  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
This heart's in hell  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
This heart's in hell

Special Secret Song Inside
Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
Well, my young lady, she lives  
Three houses away  
  
She claims that she can hear moaning and screaming  
To me fuckin' you every night  
Well, let me say "hey"  
  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on, party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Struck by lust in a telephone booth  
Busted by a cop, he said "That's uncool"  
  
He said that he hears moaning and screaming  
To me fuckin' you every night  
Well, let me say "hey"  
  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on, party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby

I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

I Am Afraid
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
I am afraid of the dark  
I am afraid of the day  
I am afraid to walk outside  
And of what people say  
  
I am afraid to drink too much  
Because of what I might do  
I am afraid to speak my mind  
And of being with you  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for you  
  
I am afraid to be unloved  
I am afraid to be forsaken  
I am afraid of doing wrong  
And to never be forgiven  
  
I am afraid that you will find  
I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not afraid to be alone  
And of the unknown  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for you  
  
I am afraid to laugh out loud  
Or to stand out of the crowd  
I am scared of loving you  
I am scared to lose you  
  
I am afraid to lose control  
I am afraid of growing old  
I am afraid to die  
But it's something I must do  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for two

Eat Some More
Alice Cooper
----------------
Sixty million tons of meat  
Spoiling in the stinking heat  
Train loads full of moldy bread  
Millions will still go unfed  
  
Acres full of dying wheat  
Burning brightly at our feet  
A billion tons of ocean fish  
Some with nothing on their dish  
  
We can't see, we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic  
  
Lots of melting cheddar cheese  
Spreading it's unique disease  
Rotting veggies on the ground  
Where little hungry little kids are found  
  
Worms in fruit an ugly sight  
They're begging for a single bite  
Our garbage dumps are mountains high  
While other people sadly die  
  
We can't see we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic  
  
We can't see we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic

California Dreamin'
Sia
----------------
[Chorus] x2  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
I've been for a walk on a winter's day  
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
  
[Verse]  
I stopped into a church I passed along the way  
Well I got down on my knees and I pretended to pray  
You know the preacher liked the cold, he knows I'm gonna stay  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
  
[Bridge]  
I'd be safe and warm  
I'd be safe and warm  
I'd be safe and warm  
I'd be safe and warm  
  
[Outro]  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
I've been for a walk on a winter's day  
If I didn't go, I could leave today  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
Oh such a winter's day  
On such a winter's day

Heaven Tells No Lies
Helloween
----------------
I could go a step ahead and try  
Harder than before but I deny  
Always when I try a step  
Something's gonna hold me back  
  
Back to where I started  
I just bump my head instead  
Better leave me here all on my own  
Better leave me or become my clone  
  
Everyone who grabbed my hand  
Fell into the same wasteland  
Don't try to convince me  
With your optimistic smile  
  
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight  
To terminate my rotten side  
Just need one shot into the center of my hate  
To light the darkness and run free from that old spell  
  
I don't know if hell or paradise  
Belong together or if heaven tells no lies  
You role the dice, you know the price  
Is higher than you can afford  
  
Beware of what you might see  
Can you trust your blinded eyes?  
I don't know if heaven tells no lies  
  
Black is white and colors turn to gray  
What was close is drifting far away  
Just now right's already wrong  
What turns weak was never strong  
Can I kill the demon without blowing out my mind?  
  
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight  
To terminate my rotten side  
Just need one shot into the center of my hate  
To light the darkness and run free from that old spell  
  
I don't know if hell or paradise  
Belong together or if heaven tells no lies  
You role the dice, you know the price  
Is higher than you can afford  
  
Beware of what you might see  
Can you trust your blinded eyes?  
I don't know if heaven tells no lies  
  
I will return, you have to burn  
Abide my vision, you no longer keep me bound  
I will be back, I will attack  
In my religion I will make you hell hound drown

Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah (You Broke My Heart)
Roxette
----------------
You promised me it would last forever  
You said there's no way it could die  
Everything you ever told me  
Was a bunch of lies  
  
Hey, I'm on the back of the outside  
You know that's not where I belong, no  
Every truth, everything I believed in  
Has turned out wrong  
  
It's all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
  
It's all clear when you scratch on the surface  
Going deeper deeper down  
All I wanted was to make you happy  
But baby, what's that sound?  
But baby, what's that sound?  
  
It's all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
  
All you ever cared for was to make you stronger  
No-one I have known has looked so weak  
Oh yeah  
  
It's all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
So many times

The number of things that you could do to me  
Baby you can drive me senseless  
Make me what you want me to be.  
'cause' you take me to the (take me) highest mountain (take me)  
Take me to (take me) the deep blue sea (take me)

Nothing that you or anybody else can do

And you know it'll be soon  
'cause' I'll give you (give you) love that (lovin') you never dreamed of

Country House
Blur
----------------
(And so the story begins)  
City dweller, successful fella  
Thought to himself  
Oops I've got a lot of money  
I'm caught in a rat race terminally  
I'm a professional cynic  
But my heart's not in it  
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit  
Caught up in the century's anxiety  
It preys on him, he's getting thin  
  
Now he lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
Watching afternoon repeats  
And the food he eats in the country  
He takes all manner of pills  
And piles up analyst bills in the country  
It's like an animal farm,  
Lots of rural charm in the country  
  
Now he's got morning glory, and life's a different story  
Everything going Jackanory  
In touch with his own mortality  
He's reading Balzac, knocking back Prozac,  
It's a helping hand  
That makes you feel wonderfully bland  
Oh, it's the century's remedy for the faint at heart,  
A new start  
  
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
He's got a fog in his chest  
So he needs a lot of rest in the country  
He doesn't drink smoke laugh  
He takes herbal baths in the country  
Oh, it's like an animal farm  
But you'll come to no harm in the country  
  
Blow blow me out I am so sad I don't know why.

Clarisse
Venom
----------------
Clarisse what perfume you wearing today no don't tell me I know  
And the soap that you washed with  
Come to me don't feel scared I'm not going to bite  
Well maybe just a little maybe just a might  
You know without windows without the wind the rain or snow  
I feel somewhat strange but of course all this you know  
Tell me about the lambs Clarisse tell me why you're scared  
I know when your father died something died in there  
To see simplicity in any mortal thing is a gift few men have  
What makes a killer a madman it's not disgusting it's sad  
I dream of trees now I smell the sea don't you find that fun  
You have the pleasures of the flesh Clarisse you can feel the sun  
But on the darker side you feel the anger rise you feel the satisfying hate  
And if you had to kill against your strongest will you wouldn't shoot that
bullet late  
Please don't judge me so wait just before you go come up closer to the cage  
Let me taste the smells of your own body cells you mustn't covert me with rage  
I ate to feed I killed in kind you believe me don't you hear the echos in your
mind  
They say I'm insane don't they but do they really know why  
They say I'm nothing but a cannibal can't understand or even try  
For in the night when I whisper from my cell and play my pshyciatric game  
In the morning when the inmate's dead they hang a new one to my fame  
If I walked the streets a free man in the heat I couldn't terrify a crowd  
But in a silent home where we'd be all alone you'd need to freshen up a shroud  
Please believe I couldn't hurt you I'd try to make you feel  
Welcomed like a friend I'd have you over for a meal  
Then I'd tear at your silken breast rip out the heart beating and bloody  
Gnaw with lust at your soften neck cutting and spitting and cooking you slowly  
Feed you up like a blooded boar fruit in the mouth and garnished with roses  
Feel nothing for you anymore deader than hell a meal for a hungry man

ABBA
----------------
I have tried in vain never had success  
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess  
I have lost my only friend  
Now it seems I have to start again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Looking for someone  
Who would want to stay  
I might find her  
With a bit of luck one day  
  
But who knows  
So until then  
I can only try and try again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round

When I First Trusted You
Keith Green
----------------
Well I though I depended upon you.  
At least that used to be what was happening with me.  
In those times of our first sweet communion,  
Nothing got in the way, I heard your voice everyday.  
When I first trusted you, gave my life to you.  
When I trusted you.  
  
Well there's something that needs to be cleared up.  
I feel so sorry inside, that my first love has died.  
Cause I've tried in my own strength to follow.  
When I've known all along, I just couldn't go wrong.  
If I'd only trusted you, give my life to you.  
If I'd trusted you. ooh, trusted you.  
  
Well I though I depended upon you.  
At least that used to be what was happening with me.  
In those times of our first sweet communion,  
Nothing got in the way, I heard your voice everyday.  
When I first trusted you, I gave my life to you.  
When I trusted you.

Foreigner

One man to the left  
One man to the right  
One man in the middle  
One man dressed in white  
  
One man in the east  
One man from the west  
One man in the middle  
One man under house arrest  
(Step back)  
  
Get hooked on the power  
Gotta stay in the game  
be the man of the hour  
Gotta make a name for yourself  
  
And the lady waits, so patiently  
She waits for the call  
She knows just what you need  
  
You need inside, information  
Information at a very high price  
She gives you inside, information  
That can change your whole life overnight,  
In a minute  
  
One man to the left  
One man to the right  
One man in the middle  
Caught in the broad daylight  
  
Just a man on the street  
Another face in the crowd  
One man on the beat  
Wants everything that he's not allowed  
  
And the lady waits, so patiently  
She waits for the call  
She knows just what you need  
  
You need inside, information  
She can get it at a very high price  
A little, inside, information  
It can change your whole life overnight  
  
With a little inside, information  
You get money, you get power, you get it all  
Yeah but that inside, information  
Can leave you waiting for that hammer to fall  
(Let it fall)  
  
She gets that inside, information  
Information at a very high price  
With that inside, information  
It's danger with each roll of the dice  
  
You want that inside, information  
Take the money, take the power, take it all  
Take that inside, information  
But get ready 'cause the hammer will fall  
It's gonna fall  
  
Inside, information

Summer Fever
Donna Summer
----------------
Winds may come and winds may blow  
But there's no wind can cure me of my fever  
Summer fever  
Time of love, time of year  
Temperature's rising, our bodies near in fever  
Summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Heat wave run, dog day night  
We're making love, things are right with fever  
Summer fever  
You burn so deep with your love so sweet  
And you satisfy and mystify my fever  
Summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Fever, summer fever  
Body to body, arms entwined  
Locked in your love and feeling fine with fever  
Summer fever  
It's the time of love, the time of year  
Temperature's rising, our bodies near in fever  
Summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Fever, summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Summer, summer fever  
Winds may come and winds may blow  
But there's no wind can cure me of my fever, I got  
Summer fever, I got  
You burn so deep, your love so sweet  
And you satisfy and mystify my fever, I got  
Summer fever, I got  
Fever, I got, summer fever, I got  
Fever, I got, summer fever, I got  
Fever, I got, summer fever, I got  
Fever, fever, fever  
Summer fever  
Summer fever  
Summer fever  
Fever, fever, fever, fever

Don't Miss You At All
Norah Jones
----------------
As I sit and watch the snow  
Fallin' down  
I don't miss you at all  
I hear children playin', laughin' so loud  
I don't think of your smile  
  
So if you never come to me  
You'll stay a distant memory  
Out my window I see lights going dark  
Your dark eyes don't haunt me  
  
And then I wonder who I am  
Without the warm touch of your hand  
  
And then I wonder who I am  
Without the warm touch of your hand  
As I sit and watch the snow  
Fallin' down  
  
I don't miss you at all  
I don't miss you at all  
I don't miss you at all

Sea Of Dreams
Electric Light Orchestra
----------------
Little girl in the sea of dreams  
There's a smile on her little face  
She looked around she could see no peace  
Her heart was sad and her body weak  
  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
  
But in her dream she was big and strong  
She fell in love with a sailor  
He travelled far off to distant lands  
He never travelled to see her  
  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
  
Then one night a strange man did come  
He whispered words unto her mother  
Little girl in the sea of dreams  
She closed her eyes and met her maker

You said you'd be here by nine  
Instead you took your time  
You didn't think to call me, boy  
Here I sit trying not to cry  
Asking myself why  
You do this to me, mm oh baby  
  
Since you're not around  
For me to tell ya baby, face to face  
I'm writing you this letter  
And this is what I have to say  
  
1 - All I really wanted was some of your time  
Instead you told me lies  
When someone else was on your mind  
What you do to me  
Look what you did to me  
  
I thought that you were someone  
Who would do me right  
Until you played with my emotions  
And you made me cry  
What you do to me  
Can't take what you did to me  
  
Now I see that you've been doin' wrong  
Played me all along  
And made a fool of me, baby  
You got it all wrong  
To think that I wouldn't find out  
That you were cheating on me, baby  
How could you do it to me  
  
Since you're not around  
For me to tell ya baby, face to face  
I'm writing you this letter  
And this is what I have to say  
  
[Repeat 1]  
Heartbreak hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel  
This is the heart break hotel

Guns N' Roses

I can't stop thinkin'  
Thinking 'bout sinkin'  
Sinkin' down into my bed

She's just a cunt now

It's always messin' my mind  
  
Too bad you're fucked up  
  
I used to be wasted  
Always tried to take it  
Take it down into my vein  
I call the doctor  
He's just another  
He said I'm sick in the brain  
He said you ain't special  
So who you foolin'  
Don't try ta give me a line  
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout  
Doin' it one more time  
(Oh no)  
But I already left you  
And you're better off left behind  
(Oh yeah)  
  
Aw it's a bad obsession  
It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind

It's always messin' my mind  
  
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout  
Doin' it one more time

See I already left you  
And you're better off left behind

It's Goin' Down
Yung Joc
----------------
This a Nitty beat (boing)  
  
Here we go again  
Ghetto ville, USA (Uh oh)  
You know I got by the name Nitty, right? (Uh huh)  
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right (Who dis
nigga, man?)  
Dis nigga go by the name of Joc (Joc)  
He resides in College Park (College Park)  
But for right now what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)  
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)  
  
Niggaz in my face  
Damn near er' day  
Askin' a million questions like  
Joc, where ya stay  
Tell 'em College Park  
Where they chop cars  
Eat twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar  
Just bought a zone, jays on my feet  
I'm on that patron, so get like me  
'69 Cutlass wit' the bucket seats  
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks  
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto'  
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough  
If a girl choose, let her do her thang  
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain  
E'rybody love me, I'm so fly  
Niggaz throw the duces e'rytime I ride by  
I know ya wonder why  
I'm so cool  
Don't ask me, just do what cha do (Okay)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down  
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down  
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down  
Anywhere ya meet me guaranteed to go down  
  
Verse numba two, do the damn thang  
Cubes on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks  
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause  
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall  
Time to flip the work, make the block bump  
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump  
Dope boy magic seven days a week  
Numba one record 'long as Nitty on the beat  
Oh, I think they like me betta, yet I know  
Lights camera action when I walk through the door  
Niggaz know my crew, we certified stars  
Valet in the front, 'bout thirty-five cars  
Bitches in the back  
Black beamer coups  
Girls like girls, time to recruit  
If ya got a problem, say it to my face  
We can knuckle up any time, any place  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Time to set it off, let these niggas know  
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit' the butterfly doors?  
I ride real slow, no need to speed  
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet  
Feds on my trail, but they don't think I know  
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope  
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in the eye  
Ask me how I know, it's me, suprise!  
Put it in the air, rep where ya stay  
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face  
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats  
I'm a make it rain, nigga, I ain't scared to share it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yung Joc  
Nitty strikes again  
This a Nitty beat

Scavenger Of Human Sorrow
Death
----------------
What pain will it take  
To satisfy your sick appetite  
Go in for the kill  
Always in sight-prey  
The time always right-feast  
Feed on the pain-taste  
Sorrow made flesh-sweet  
Live how you want  
Just don't feed on me  
If you doubt what I say  
I will make you believe  
Shallow are words from those who starve  
For a dream not their own to slash and scar  
  
Big words, small mind  
Behind the pain you will find  
A scavenger of human sorrow  
Scavenger  
Abstract theory the weapon of choice  
Used by scavenger of human sorrow  
Scavenger  
  
So you have traveled far across the sea  
To spread your written brand of misery

I've Got Friends That Do
Tim McGraw
----------------
This is for the nobody  
The one in the crowd  
Whos got a  
Lost look on his face  
  
This is for the downtrodden  
The one that the worlds forgotten  
Waiting on a better day  
  
Well I'm in no  
Position to judge em  
Heaven knows  
Theyre just like me  
  
And im not alone  
In knowing what its like  
To wonder where your going  
In this crazy real  
  
And im not alone  
In knowing how it feels  
To pray to god  
And sometimes wonder if hes real  
Cause I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
This is for the lost junkie  
Who spends all his hard earned money  
On something that he hates  
  
And this is for the found guilty  
Who aint getting out  
Until he pays his debt to the state  
  
Well I'm in no  
Position to judge em  
Heaven knows  
Theyre just like me  
  
And I may not know  
What its like  
To lose your job  
Cause a habit's got you gripped too tight  
  
And I may not know  
How it feels  
To lay your head down on a prison bed in a world of steel  
But I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
This is for yours truly  
Just a little verse to remind me  
We've all got somewhere to turn  
  
And I may not know  
What its like  
To send my only son  
To save the world  
And watch him die  
  
And I may not know  
How it feels  
To hang there on the cross  
To prove that love is real  
But I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
You know we all got friends that do

On The Run Again
Yngwie Malmsteen
----------------
Outcast, not knowing right from wrong  
Surrounded by women, wine, and song  
Never still always on the run  
Prince of the night, killing with a gun  
  
Now, he's taken a life away  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay  
  
Renegade, he fled from town to town  
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down  
For his head, lies a might price  
He's a wanted man, dead or alive  
  
Where will he go from here  
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...  
  
He's got mixed emotions running through his head  
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead  
  
He's on the run, again...(repeat 4 times)  
Tell me when will it end

Life's Too Short To Love This Fast
Alabama
----------------
You say hello, I say goodbye  
You go your way and I go mine  
There's not much time for you and I these days  
We work too hard, we're gone too much  
And we're too tired to even touch  
So just how long can we go on this way  
  
Oh, life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
We can't keep up this pace we're on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns, we start again  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
Let's take some time, let's get away  
Let's pack our bags and leave today  
Girl, anyplace would be okay right now  
Just leave your pager here at home  
And I won't carry my cell phone  
We need to find some time alone somehow  
  
Yeah, life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
We can't keep up this pace we're on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns, we start again  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
We're spinnin' our wheels  
Forgetting how love feels  
Let's slow down before it's too late  
  
Cause life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
Love this fast  
Life's too short

What Happened To You?
Offspring
----------------
Before you started tokin  
You used to have a brain  
But now you don't get even the simplest of things  
I can draw a little picture  
  
Or even use my hands  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
Man you're really losin' it  
And you've really done a lot of junk now  
  
But you keep abusin' it  
What in the world happened to you  
It's bad enough you do it to yourself  
But taking someone with you well you know that's something else  
  
I say I'm not that kind of person  
I'm not that kind of man  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack  
  
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back  
But you do it in the morning  
You do it in the night  
You lie to refrain from just facing your life  
  
So I'll see you man tomorrow  
You'll be gackin' up again  
I'll see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent  
I think of all the times that I tried to lend a hand  
  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
  
[Chorus]

Eyes On Me
Celine Dion
----------------
I know that once in love  
You don't think of the devil who's inside  
And maybe it'll come one day  
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time  
  
You hear what you wanna hear  
Play it once I could disappear  
Some rules to the game of me  
Get it right for both of us  
  
Just say what you wanna say  
I've got it to give away  
We both wanna make it last  
So keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
  
It's not an illusion  
That you're the one  
And I have fallen deep  
I said it from the start  
When we're apart  
You must only think of me  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
  
And say that you want me  
Open up your heart  
Even if it's hard  
Say that you need me  
Then let him know  
Baby don't put on a show  
  
You say that you need me  
Tell him how you feel  
Let him know it's real  
And if you love me  
Never turn your back  
Gonna keep my eyes on him  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me

God Bless The Child
Diana Ross
----------------
Them that's God shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Yeah, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't  
Ever make the grade  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowdin' round the door  
When its gone and  
Spendin' ends  
They don't come no more  
  
Rich relations give  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own

Inside Out
Korn
----------------
I like the way you're so fucked up  
Naked and wearing no makeup  
I watch your pulse beneath your skin  
Sometimes I wish I could crawl in  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
  
I like the way your ''ribs'' contract  
When you are lying on your back  
The ''bruises you internalize'' eternalize  
The thoughts behind those crazy eyes  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
  
Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art  
But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart  
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you  
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard  
  
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you  
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard  
  
I drink the milk that's in your breast  
I wouldn't even mind your shit  
I put my tounge inside your ear  
I'm gonna eat you up right here  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out

American Night
Doors
----------------
All hail the American night!  
  
What was that?  
I don't know  
Sounds like guns, thunder.  
  
Alright! Alright! Alright!  
Hey, listen! Listen! Listen, man! listen, man!  
I don't know how many you people believe in astrology  
Yeah, that's right, that's right, baby, I, I am a  
Sagittarius  
The most philosophical of all the signs  
But anyway, I don't believe in it  
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself  
But I tell you this, man, I tell you this  
I don't know what's gonna happen, man,  
But I want to have my kicks  
Before the whole shithouse goes up in flames  
Alright!

Will You Still Be There?
Howard Jones
----------------
How many lives have been shaken  
'cause a few simple actions were not taken  
There will be a time, time for the next world  
Can't let the feelings be left unsaid  
Chorus  
Will you still be there when the night comes  
The glory's over and the chill comes  
When the night comes, will you still be there  
Will you still be there when the night comes  
Will you still be there?  
When the world seems to fall apart for us  
When all the hope has turned to desperation  
How can we torture, torture the ones that we Love  
Can't let the feelings be left unsaid  
How many hearts have been broken  
How many have been broken in two  
'cause a few simple words had not been spoken  
Not been spoken, no, no, no  
There's a need to know that we're wanted  
That we're wanted yeah, yeah, yeah  
There's a need to know you care  
Need to know who cares for you yes we do

Handle My Heart With Love
Cliff Richard
----------------
Your sweet embrace, your hand in mine  
So close together  
How many times I've made you mine  
Is this forever?  
Promises and dreams we've shared  
Do you remember?  
Oh, here we are, so near and yet so far  
From each other  
Chorus:  
Handle my heart with love  
Don't let me hope in vain  
Only your touch can save my heart  
From breaking again  
So handle my heart with love  
Stay and you'll ease my pain  
Only your touch can save my heart  
From breaking again  
Your gentle smile, your tender touch  
So captivating  
No other love has meant this much  
And I'll go on waiting  
One day in your arms I'll hear  
This is forever  
I know it's there, though right now it's hard to care  
For each other  
Repeat chorus  
Don't make us part  
Please don't brake my heart again

Run Straight Down
Warren Zevon
----------------
I went walking in the wasted city  
Started thinking about entropy  
Smelled the wind from the ruined river  
Went home to watch TV  
  
And it's worse when I try to remember  
When I think about then and now  
I'd rather see it on the news at eleven  
Sit back, and watch it run straight down  
  
Run straight down  
Run straight down  
I can see it with my eyes closed  
Run straight down  
  
We've been living in the shadows all our lives  
Where it's stand in line and don't look back and don't look left and don't
look right  
So we hide our eyes and wonder who'll survive  
Waiting for the night...  
  
Fluorocarbons in the ozone layer  
First the water and the wildlife go  
Pretty soon there's not a creature stirring  
'Cept the robots at the dynamo  
  
And it's worse when I try to remember  
When I think about then and now  
I'd rather see it on the news at eleven  
Sit back, and watch it run straight down  
  
Run straight down  
Run straight down  
I can see it with my eyes closed  
Run straight down

D.F. (Interlude)
Outkast
----------------
Children of the junks  
Slant eyed  
Children of the junks  
Go by  
Mama's comin' soon  
And the junks are turning in the  
Spring sky  
Dragon rings  
Tax free things  
Forever  
People pick and pay  
Till the day fades away  
Cooling in the wind  
Comrades all  
Red papers ring  
Flowers in the sun, shining  
On the children of the world  
Night comes  
Sleep for me  
Ain't nothing, just a moonstruck junk  
On the sea, kowloon  
All the junks are sleeping  
Spinning flowers on the shade  
All the junks are sleeping  
But alley cats and renegades

Born With The Hunger
Cher
----------------
Hear the coyote howl  
He's found his prey at last  
In one moment of weakness  
The chase is over so fast  
He celebrates his kill  
No mercy in his eyes  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
Midnight is on the prowl  
And I hear it call my name  
Danger lurks in the shadows  
But it's all part of a game  
Until I quench this thirst  
I will not close these eyes  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
You and I, we're the same  
We both carry this flame  
To depths of our souls  
Once this fever awakes  
We can never escape  
It's beyond our control  
We're all born with the hunger  
We're all born with the hunger  
Temptation bites your lip  
One kiss ignites the fire  
So begins the seduction  
As we succumb to desire  
Your body aches for more  
Why are you so surprised  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger - it never dies

You wanna know if I could ever kill somebody  
Well that's like askin Charlie Manson if he's ever been in jail  
I kill family, friends, myself  
What, yeah, I'd kill myself if I could only survive  
I tried to kill Rob Van Winkle, in fact that's how we met  
I went up to kill him and he was thinkin the same shit  
I pulled out a chainsaw, he pulled out and ax  
I was like come-on, wait is that a Stanley, where'd you get that  
It's natural and to murder, you gotta have it in you

Last survivor with a mouth full of cockroaches  
I bring this hocus pocus  
You're flying away  
Like the last days of the motherfuckin loafers  
I'm the redneck in the moshpit  
2 axes come in handy  
To answer Violent J, ya damn right its a stanley  
In the shadows of the dark with darkman like spawn  
In the dash blazin it up with explosive bombs  
I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM  
While zipping bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM  
Ice mixed with blood is the killers milkshake  
Here with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathbreak  
Chorus--  
Mass murders  
Natural born killas

Disrespect me I'll run in your house  
Like puffin steam stout  
Break both your arms, gun in your mouth  
Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth  
Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die swift  
Fuckin wit tha clan, watch what you say  
We kill niggas like the KKK  
Shoot you with an SK or a AK bitch you gonna die either way  
I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head  
Cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead  
Catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho  
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo  
I'm a Sing-Sing killer  
Gun groove captain  
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping  
Gats get brung, niggas get done  
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons  
I'm a killer

OVERDUB: To die is a fate that must come to us all  
But how horrible to be buried alive  
From the darkness they shuffle eyes glazed with death  
Hands clawing for blood!

My Friend, My Friend
Phish
----------------
My friend, my friend he's got a knife  
A statement from his former life  
When he was easy but alone  
Beside him was an empty throne  
But what of silver silken blade  
Affix his gaze, his features staid  
Grasps the handle, clips the cable  
One steps up, sits at his table  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a wife  
  
My friend, my friend, the clever ruse  
Persuasion through his thoughts peruse  
A hidden relic from his past  
That wasn't there when he looked last  
He feels it ticking like a bomb  
Feeding fear, assaulting calm  
Takes the object, starts the game  
Moves closer to the flame  
  
My friend, my friend, the clever ruse  
My friend, my friend, he lights the fuse  
  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife

Bluebird
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
Listen to my bluebird laugh  
She can't tell you why  
Deep within in her heart, you see  
She knows only crying  
Oh just lie  
  
There she sits, a lofty perch  
Strangest color blue  
Flying is forgotten, now  
Thinks only of you...just you...awh yeah  
  
So get all those blues  
Must be a thousand yous  
And you just differently used, you just know  
You sit there mesmerized, by the depth of her eyes  
If you could categorize, she got soul  
She got soul, she got soul, she got soul  
  
Do you think she loves you  
Do you think at all  
  
Soon she's going to fly away  
Sadness is her own  
Give herself a bath of tears  
And go home, and go home

God's Top Ten
Chris Brown
----------------
(written by Andrew Farriss)  
(feat. Suzie Mcneil)  
  
Romance is gone, he's drifting with the stars  
The lyric in his pocket, little girl in his heart  
When you hear his songs on the radio I don't need to tell you what you already
know  
He's in God's top ten where heaven never ends  
  
You saw the world and the world saw you on the stage  
Wild, wild, wild, Colonial Boy  
Roquefort le Pont  
Your gypsy heart is free, pictures on the wall of your family  
He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends  
He's on God's top ten  
  
Baby's got mama's eyes, she was always beautiful  
When you hear his voice, feel his arms around you  
You remember mama's smile and daddy's little girl  
Bad weather, cold media storm  
He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends  
He's on God's top ten

The Sinner In Me
Depeche Mode
----------------
[Chorus]  
If I could just hide  
The sinner inside  
And keep him denied  
How sweet life would be  
If I could be free  
From the sinner in me  
  
I'll never be a saint  
That's not a picture that your memory paints  
Not renowned for my patience  
I'm not renowned for my restraint  
But you're always around  
You can always be found  
To pick me up when I'm on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm still recovering  
Still getting over all the suffering  
More known for my anger  
Than for any other thing  
But you've always tried  
To be by my side  
And catch my fall when I start to slide  
  
[Chorus]

Everywhere is a target zone  
Hell is ringing on the red, red phone

Vodka chilled in the Kremlin bar  
Ride on the rocky (???) and hold my arm  
Raise my glass and break it on the bar

Are you red

Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken?
Lloyd Cole
----------------
Looking like a born again  
Living like a heretic  
Listening to arthur lee records  
Making all your friends feel so guilty  
About their cynicism  
And the rest of their generation  
Not even the government are gonna stop you now  
But are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
  
Pumped up full of vitamins  
On account of all the seriousness  
You say you're so happy now  
You can hardly stand  
Lean over on the bookcase  
If you really want to get straight  
Read norman mailer  
Or get a new tailor  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to bleed?  
  
What would it take  
What would it take to wipe that smile off of your face?  
Are you ready to be, are you ready to bleed?  
  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to bleed? (heartbroken)  
Well you better get ready now baby  
Are you ready to bleed? , ready to bleed?

Hymn To Her
Pretenders
----------------
Let me inside you  
Into your room  
I've heard it's lined  
With the things you don't show  
Lay me beside you  
Down on the floor  
I've been your lover  
From the womb to the tomb  
I dress as your daughter  
When the moon becomes round  
You be my mother  
When everything's gone  
  
And she will always carry on  
Something is lost  
But something is found  
They will keep on speaking her name  
Somethings change  
Some stay the same  
  
Keep beckoning to me  
From behind that closed door  
The maid and the mother  
And the crone that's grown old  
  
I hear your voice  
Coming out of that hole  
I listen to you  
And I want some more  
I listen to you  
And I want some more  
  
And she will always carry on  
Something is lost  
But something is found  
They will keep on speaking her name  
Some things change  
Some stay the same

Heavenly Father  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Here we are together  
Start of a new day  
In these precious moments  
I've got so much to say  
When I think about who You are  
And all the things that You do  
I lift my voice  
And start praising You  
Chorus:  
Heavenly Father  
You're such a good father to me  
Heavenly Father  
There's no place that I'd rather be  
Some days are much better  
Than the ones before  
But everyday I spend with You  
I love You that much more  
Even when I fail You  
And I try to turn and run  
You take my hand  
And I know I'm Your son  
Chorus  
The world rushes by  
Day after day  
There's so much to do  
There's no time to pray  
But I've found with You  
A joy that's complete  
Kneeling at Your feet

Sometimes I think it would be better  
If you just walked away  
And stopped returning phone calls  
Come out to see the band play  
  
Lady, Leave me, I will love you more  
Sometimes I only speak when  
I'm ignored  
  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
I'm sending out a  
Warning 'cause I think you oughta know  
If catching you is easy then I'm gonna have to let you go  
  
Sometimes I wish you wouldn't smile  
Every time I come around  
And pick me up so easily  
Every time I let you down  
  
And baby  
Make me  
Crazy  
If you can  
  
Miscommunicate to make me  
Understand  
  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
I'm sending out a  
Warning 'cause I think you oughta know  
If catching you is easy then I'm gonna have to to let you go  
  
Let you go home  
I can swim like a stone again  
  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me

Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp
George Harrison
----------------
Let it roll across the floor  
Through the hall and out the door  
To the fountain of perpetual mirth  
Let it roll for all it's worth  
  
Find me where ye echo lays  
Lose ye bodies in the maze  
See the lord and all the mouths he feeds  
Let it roll among the weeds  
Let it roll  
  
Let it roll down through the caves  
Ye long walks of coole and shades  
Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile  
Handkerchiefs to match your tie  
Let it roll  
  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll  
  
Fools illusions everywhere  
Joan and molly sweep the stairs  
Eyes that shining full of inner light  
Let it roll into the night  
  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll

Old 61's my number on the hi-way

I'm tuned into some bad-ass transactions  
It's the only way to get my satisfaction

Antenna waves be burnin' up my radio  
Mister DJ say it's the only way to go  
Cranked up all the way my tube is turnin4 red  
Got a pocket full uh cornbread just call it

Automatic
Prince
----------------
You ask me if I love you, it's automatic  
Cause every time you leave me, I die, that's automatic to  
You ask me to forgive you, when you know, I'm just an addict  
So stop the music baby, you know, You're all I want to do  
Hey  
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do  
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with you  
  
You ask me if I'll kiss you, it's automatic  
And if you cry, me cry, boo-hoo, that's automatic to  
I would never leave you, no matter what you do  
Stop the music baby, you know, I'm an automatic fool  
Hey  
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do (And don't stop)  
A-U-T-O-matic, oh, I'm so in love with you  
  
I'll rub your back forever, it's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)  
I'll look for a needle in a haystack, that's automatic to (A-U-T-O-matic)  
I'll go down on you all night long, it's automatic,  
(I will, yes I will babe)  
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong,  
That's automatic to (A-U-T-O-matic)  
Hey  
(A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)  
Tell me what 2 do babe  
(A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you)  
Hey  
So in love with you, yeah (A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)  
Tell me what to do babe (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with yop)  
Hey  
So in love with you, baby, yeah (A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)  
Alright, alright,  
Tell me what to do baby (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you)  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Hey  
A-U-T-O-matic  
A-U-T-O-matic  
  
C'mon baby  
A-U-T-O-matic, tell me what to do  
A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you  
  
Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream  
Baby you're the purple star in the night supreme  
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love  
I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of  
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kissed  
Not with our lips but with our souls  
Stop me if I bore you  
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?  
Can you hear me? Why do I love you so much?  
It's strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked,  
Can you hear me?  
I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me  
  
Stop the music baby, automatic fool  
  
When it comes to you I'm automatic baby  
There's no one else like me  
I'm the best you'll ever find  
No one else could understand you, you're to complex  
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know you  
That's automatic to  
Can you hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)  
Yes, I'm addicted to your pleasure  
I'm addicted to your pain  
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)  
Automatically insane  
Undress me (A-U-T-O-matic)  
(A-U-T-O-matic)  
Hey (A-U-T-O-matic)  
(A-U-T-O-matic)  
(A-U-T-O-matic)  
(A-U-T-O-matic)  
Hey  
Fasten your seat belts  
Prepare for takeoff  
  
(I remember how you kissed me)  
(Not with your lips but with your soul)  
(With you I'm never bored, talk to me some more)  
(I can hear you, I'm going to have to torture you now)

Tangled Up In Love
Keith Urban
----------------
You know the cards are stacked against this  
As we surrender our defenses  
And I've torn down all my fences just for you  
And you feel it too  
What do we do  
Do we run or see it through  
The longer we're together  
It just keeps gettin' better  
And you hide your little love letters  
Around the house for me  
And it's plain to see  
That you'll always be all I'll ever need  
  
[Chorus]  
The webs we spun  
Wove into one  
And left us tangled up in love  
You squeeze my hand I understand  
About a woman and a man  
I love the way you make me feel  
You got me tangled up in love  
The webs we spun  
Wove into one  
Left us tangled up in love  
  
[Chorus]

I Lost On Jeopardy
Weird Al Yankovic
----------------
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
I was there to match my intellect on national TV  
Against a plumber, oh, and an architect, both with a PhD  
I was tense, I was nervous, I guess it just wasn't my night  
Art Fleming gave the answers  
Oh, but I couldn't get the questions right, aight, aight  
  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
  
Well, I knew I was in trouble now  
My hope of winning sank  
Oh, 'cause I got the Daily Double now  
And then my mind went blank  
I took Potpourri for one hundred  
And then my head started to spin  
Well, I'm givin' up Don Pardo  
Just tell me now what I didn't win, yeah, yeah  
  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
  
That's right, Al You lost. And let me tell you what you didn't win: a twenty
column set of the Encyclopedia International, a case of Turtle Wax, and a
year's supply of Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco Treat. But that's not all. You
also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people. You
brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come. You
don't get to come back tomorrow. You don't even get a lousy copy of our home
game. You're a complete loser!  
  
Don't know what I was thinkin' of  
I guess I just wasn't too bright  
Well, I sure hope I do better  
Next weekend on The Price Is Right, aight, aight  
  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby

Worthless
Point Of Grace
----------------
I woke up today with a revelation  
An introduction to the truth  
I knew the world was round  
What goes up comes down  
And maybe I  
Finally got it figured out  
Chorus  
A moment is worthless  
No meaning, purpose  
Every breath is just wasted  
If you are not the center of my world  
I'm just drifting, barely existing  
Every minute without you  
Is worthless  
You know the state of my condition  
And yet you hold me anyway  
So I won't take a step unless it's your direction  
Where was I  
Before I finally realized  
Chorus  
There's a void in my heart  
Where it's empty and dark  
Without You and Your love  
Lord, I'm broken apart  
I surrender my life  
To be right where You are

Overdrive
Foo Fighters
----------------
Every now I'm running out  
This time I think I'm breaking up  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now I'm drifting out  
This time it keeps on sinking us  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
There's a lie, I think you'll find  
It's locked inside of everyone  
You and I get on with life  
Pray we'll find a better one  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now I'm drifting out  
This time I think it's sinking us  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging  
Keep hanging  
You keep hanging  
By a thread

Now That I Found You
Michael Bolton
----------------
I can still remember  
When all I had was time  
A time when I had nothin'  
But this empty heart of mine  
  
When I needed inspiration  
When the night was all I knew  
You were the light shinin' into my life  
The reason for all the love I'm feelin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Now that I've found you  
I don't know how I lived without you  
I don't know how I survived without your love  
Now that I've found you  
I only know I'd be lost without you  
I found the love  
That I'll never find again  
'Cause all I ever needed  
And all I ever wanted  
Has come true  
I found it all now that I've found you  
  
I could've searched forever  
And never realized  
The treasure of a lifetime  
Was the love inside your eyes  
When I reach for inspiration  
In your touch, it's always there  
Givin' me faith every step of the way  
Givin' me all I ever needed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And every step of the way  
Gonna dedicate my heart to you  
Promise you my world forever  
Pledgin' my love my whole life through

Bodyguard
Bee Gees
----------------
It hurts me when you cry  
When you feel the love is gone  
Don't give up on us  
When you got so much to believe in  
And I beg you please stay  
Strangers in the night  
A flame that never dies  
In a world of lonely faces  
You need someone to survive  
A heart like yours  
Should never live alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Lost inside  
It's only you and me  
  
There's things you shouldn't do  
You lose your self control  
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger  
Take you down to a new sensation  
Just turn back to me  
Don't wait till its gone  
Don't go where you don't belong  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours  
Should always find a home  
  
I know the signs and I'm telling you  
You're living on borrowed time  
But a heart needs love  
Like a flower needs rain  
Like I'm making you mine  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
What we had never known all our lives  
I pray its not too late  
I would die by your side my love  
I'm the life that you save  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours should never live alone  
  
I used to dream of a special one  
And now I feel it coming true  
But I could'nt let go, I'm a jealous guy  
What you're putting me through  
I'm begging you  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far  
  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far

Long Road
Pearl Jam
----------------
And I wished for so long. Cannot stay.  
All the precious moments. Cannot stay.  
It's not like wings have fallen. Cannot stay.  
But still something's missing. I cannot say, yeah.  
Holding hands are daughters and sons.  
And their faiths are falling down, down, down, down.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
Will I walk the long road? (the long road) Cannot stay. (the long road)  
There's no need to say goodbye. (to say goodbye)  
All the friends and family.  
All the memories going round, round, round, round.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
And the wind keeps roaring. And the sky keeps turning grey.  
And the sun is set. The sun will rise another day.  
I...  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road. We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road?  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road?

And wait for that odd day  
Please go right, go right, go right  
Hey won't you?

Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh  
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou  
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou  
  
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and a fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
  
Thibideaux, Fountaineaux, the place is buzzin'  
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen  
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
  
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and a fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh

Ghosts Of War
Slayer
----------------
Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.  
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.  
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,  
Not content with wars we never won.  
  
Memories can't ignore  
Anguish of before  
Satisfy the scorn.  
Rise ghosts of war.  
  
Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.  
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.  
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny  
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.  
  
[Memories can't ignore  
Anguish of before  
Satisfy the scorn.  
Rise ghosts of war.]  
  
I deal in pain.  
All life I drain.  
I dominate.  
I seal your fate.  
  
I deal in pain.  
All life I drain.  
Memories can't ignore,  
Rise ghost of war.

Dairy Queen
Indigo Girls
----------------
I heard that you were drunk and mean  
Down at  
The dairy queen  
Now there's just enough of you in me  
For me to have  
This sympathy  
And take it in stride  
I know I had mine  
And you were as kind  
I am told  
  
Ain't it funny how we lose one day  
And a lifetime  
Slips away  
I'm looking back on us that way  
Something I  
I never thought I'd say  
I take it in stride  
I know I had mine  
It was good for a time  
I am told  
It was good for a time I am told  
  
The love you gave was not for free  
But the price  
Was truly fair  
I never felt so glad to be  
So well spent  
So beyond repair  
And I take it in stride  
At least you were mine  
If not for all time  
Enough to hold  
Oh at least  
Enough for me  
To hold you  
  
Now take good care that you are true  
You said you found it  
Hard to do  
And find that bit of faith that sets you free  
From having everything to prove  
And you take it in stride  
And know you've got mine  
And it's good for a lifetime  
Or more  
Hey I love  
I love you  
More and more  
  
Oh I love you more and more  
Yeah

Church On Sunday
Green Day
----------------
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives  
Tomorrow is too late to pretend  
Everything's all right  
I'm not getting any younger as long as you don't get any older  
I'm not going to state that yesterday never was  
  
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep  
Making your mascara bleed  
Tears down your face  
Leaving traces of mistakes  
  
If I promise to go to church on Sunday  
Will you go with me on Friday night?  
If you live with me, I'll die for you  
And this compromise  
  
I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth  
And nothing but the truth is what I'll ever hear from you  
"Trust" is a dirty word that comes only from such a liar  
But "respect" is something I will earn...  
If you have faith

My Oedipus Complex
Kid Rock
----------------
I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
I've been livin a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time  
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto lood like heaven  
  
And I believe it stems down from my family situation  
I never liked my old man  
I couldn't stand to be around him  
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin at his picture, yeah  
My heart turns to stone and I think of this  
  
I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
You never loved me, you never held me tight  
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night  
You tried to make me think that your ways were best  
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress  
  
Life it's the ultimate sin  
A game with no rules that you're expected to win  
My personal hell's hidden with a grin  
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin  
  
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool  
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool  
You should've went to school like your bigger brother  
But you played the fool with a different color  
  
Runnin' ship with a whip  
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped  
Money made you so wise  
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes  
  
Do as I say and not as I do  
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you  
And oh the pain how it hurts  
It was always your home and your business that came first  
  
You said a man is as good as his word  
But your mind was closed and mine never heard  
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured  
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard  
  
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree  
Look at you then look at me...  
  
You ain't nothin' to me you've never been to me  
And all you ever gave a damn about was money see  
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me  
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free  
  
Now I know growin' up son that it ain't always been easy  
And I know at times I was not always there for you  
No we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time  
But understand growin' up son I never had a dime  
  
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college  
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all  
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us  
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you  
  
Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so  
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so  
  
I always loved you I always cared for you  
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through  
I tried to raise my fuckin' family just the best I know  
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know  
Dah  
  
Alright, get down baby  
Yeah  
  
I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
I need somebody please, please help me  
I need somebody you must tell me who I am  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tell me who I am  
Hey, hey  
Tell me who I am  
I am, I am  
Tell me who I am, am, am  
Tell me  
Tell me  
  
If it looks good, you'll see it...  
If it sounds good, you'll hear it...  
If it's marketed right, you'll buy it...  
But if it's real, you'll feel it...

Say You Really Want Me
Kim Wilde
----------------
Why you always got to be so cool  
And why I always got to play your fool  
You don't really know what life's about  
Baby come and let your feelings out  
  
Say you really want me  
Don't keep it to yourself  
Say you really need me  
Just me and no one else  
Say you really love me  
Ooh let me know it's true  
Say you really want me  
The way that I want you tonight  
  
You don't know a thing about romance  
Deep inside you're scared to take the chance  
'Cause love like this may never come again  
Make your move or I'll be in the wind  
  
I need somebody through the thick and the thin  
'Cause I know the problems of today  
The time is over now for playing those games  
Lets take it all the way

Bed Of Lies
Nicki Minaj
----------------
[Hook: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
You could never make eye contact  
Everything you got was based off of my contacts  
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat  
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap  
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it  
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it  
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it  
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it  
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'  
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public  
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating  
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Hook: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  
  
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes  
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies  
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace  
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate  
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend  
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend  
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em  
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some  
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me  
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me  
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony  
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy  
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn  
But there was something that I should've asked all along  
I'mma ask on the song  
  
[Bridge: Skylar]  
So does she know I've been in that bed before  
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  
If I was just another girl  
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you  
There's one thing I need to know  
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself  
  
[Outro: Skylar]  
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies  
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes  
They only pretend, you will be mine  
And you know how you made me, believe  
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?  
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

I Got Trouble
Christina Aguilera
----------------
Hm, yeah, yeah  
Hm, mm  
  
I've got trouble, trouble, trouble  
Always knocking at my door  
Yes, I'm a whole lot of trouble, baby  
Just like a kid in a candy store  
Well, I'm nothing but trouble, babe  
Not since the day that I was born  
Well, I'm as good as it gets  
Give you something you won't forget  
If you wanna spell trouble, babe  
Well, send out an S.O.S., yes  
  
'Cause baby's got something  
Something you just can't ignore  
And, yeah, it sure is likely, baby  
You'll keep coming back for more  
  
I've got a wicked taste for trouble  
And I'm never, never, satisfied  
Yeah, I'm a whole lot of trouble, baby  
And my evil ways kill life  
  
Oh, my, my  
  
Well, I've been itching for some trouble, baby  
Every single day that I'm alive  
  
Come on, baby, come on, darling  
Come on sugar, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Baby, whoa, whoa, yeah  
  
Now listen  
Can't you see the way I move?  
Can't you read it in my hips?  
There's a lot that's going on  
In my pocket full of tricks  
Got some secrets up my sleeve  
If you know just what I mean  
Got places you've never been  
Take you out of your skin  
  
Well, I'm trouble, trouble, trouble, baby  
Always knocking at my door  
Yes, I'm a whole lot of lot of trouble, baby  
Oh, since the day that I was born  
  
Yeah, oh yeah

Noise
Kenny Chesney
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Wrecking balls, downtown construction  
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing  
Cardboard sign says the lord is coming  
Tick, tick, tock  
Rumors turn the mills back home  
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown  
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off  
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here  
Seems like all we ever hear is  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Verse 2]  
24 hour television, get so loud that no one listens  
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk  
But there really ain't no conversation  
Ain't nothing left to the imagination  
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop  
  
[Chorus]  
This noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Bridge]  
Every room, every house, every shade of noise  
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise  
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise  
We can't take the noise, so we just make...  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Outro]  
All this noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't stand the noise  
Can't take the noise

I'd Cry Like A Baby
Dean Martin
----------------
I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye,  
I'd feel like a snowball on the fourth of July,  
If you ever said you were leaving for good,  
I'd weep like a weeping willow, honest I would.  
  
I'd cry like a baby with a busted balloon,  
I'd let out a wail that would be heard on the moon,  
Our love was so splendid, don't end it so soon  
Don't leave me here sighing, a-sobbing and a-sighing,  
Crying like a baby for you.  
  
I'd cry like a baby if you told me goodbye,  
I'd feel like a snowball on the fourth of July,  
If you ever said you were leaving for good,  
I'd weep like a weeping willow, honest I would.  
  
I'd cry like a baby with a busted balloon,  
I'd let out a wail that would be heard on the moon,  
Our love was so splendid, don't end it so soon  
Don't leave me here sighing, a-sobbing and a-sighing,  
Crying like a baby for you...

Imagine
Train
----------------
Finally met Virginia on a slow summer night  
Thought I should forgive you so I came back  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Right for those lies  
They save me after all!  
Right from the beginning we were wrong I found  
But no one did it better baby pound for pound  
Those heavyweight fights were right for me  
To learn how to see the light clearly  
And it's the light I see in you!  
  
[Chorus]  
No, don't go  
I'll show you what it's like to be loved!  
No, don't go  
I'll show you what it's like to be loved!  
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)  
What it's like to be loved!  
  
Now that things are better for me  
I can laugh at all your other lovers  
When you do the math  
Does it make you feel sad,  
Make you feel small?  
Thank God it ain't about me anymore!  
I'm not coming back for round 2  
I just wanna love you like a friend would do  
You weren't wrong for the feelings you had  
But the man that I was isn't coming back  
So stay, it's OK!  
  
No, don't go  
I'll show you what it's like to be loved!  
No, don't go  
I'll show you what it's like to be loved!  
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)  
What it's like to be loved!  
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)  
  
When you said it's over  
I lost my head!  
And now that we're older  
I'm giving up on being right  
So I can see the other side of you!  
  
No, don't go  
I'll show you what it's like to be loved!  
No, don't go  
I'll show you what it's like to be loved!  
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)  
When you said it's Over  
What it's like to be loved!  
(ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)  
I lost my head!  
What it's like to be loved!  
And now that we're older  
What it's like, what it's like to be loved!

Only One
Kanye West
----------------
[Intro]  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say  
  
[Hook 1]  
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun  
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say  
  
[Hook 2]  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand  
  
[Bridge]  
So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly  
  
[Hook 3]  
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun  
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name  
And you're still my chosen one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Outro]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab (I just want you to do me a favor)

Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me

Dark Lady
Cher
----------------
The fortune queen of New Orleans,  
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine  
On the backseat were scratches from  
The marks of men her fortune she had won  
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,  
She said "home James" and he hit the gas  
I followed her to some darkened room,  
She took my money, she said "I'll be with you soon"  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three  
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me  
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,  
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black  
She said the man you love is secretly true  
To someone else who is very close to you  
My advice is that you leave this place,  
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
So I ran home and crawled in my bed,  
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said  
Then I remembered her strange perfume,  
And how I smelled it was in my own room!  
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,  
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand  
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,  
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself

Rest Calm
Nightwish
----------------
I went to die in a seaside hotel  
Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments  
  
Deathbed memories of home  
Never let me go  
  
Every little memory resting calm in me  
Resting in a dream  
Smiling back at me  
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home  
To caress the river with awe  
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me  
Resting in a dream  
Smiling back at me  
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home  
Rest calm and remember me  
  
You are the moon pulling my black waters  
You are the land in my dark closet  
Stay by my side until it goes dark forever  
When silent the silence comes closer

Shinin' On
Grand Funk Railroad
----------------
We are winners and losers, bed fellow choosers,  
Put here to pass by the times.  
We are space-age sailors, all had our failures,  
Now everybody gonna' shine.  
  
Keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin' on.  
  
See the fire within them burnin',  
Touch the fire make me feel so fine.  
Keep the fire within you livin'  
Everybody gonna' shine, shine, shine.  
  
Keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin' on.  
  
Shinin' on.  
Shinin' on.  
  
What?  
Well, alright.  
  
Keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin' on.  
  
Keep it shinin' on, shinin' on, shinin' on.  
  
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on.

Cafe
Tim Buckley
----------------
I was just a curly-haired mountain boy  
On my way  
Passing through I heard a voice  
Whisper good evening  
I turned to a shadow  
And saw her there  
So all alone  
She had those sad china eyes  
That sang each time she smiled  
Ah, but the song  
It seemed to linger  
So long it deepened  
My love for her  
Until she called me near  
And then we waltzed to our heart beat  
All around  
The sea was swaying  
The breeze was praying  
Never to leave her alone  
Alone  
Oh, the time just slipped on by  
And with the time  
So did our love  
Ah, her every move  
Just like a fever  
Just like a fever  
Burnin' inside would not leave me

California
Beach Boys
----------------
On my way to sunny California  
  
On my way to spend another sunny day  
  
Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water  
  
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place  
  
The sun shines brightly down on the bay  
  
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Have you ever been south of Monterey  
  
Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea  
  
'Neath waves of golden sunshine  
  
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay  
  
The south coast plows the sea  
  
And the people there are of the breed  
  
They don't need electricity  
  
Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water  
  
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze.  
  
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way.  
  
Have you ever been down Salinas way?  
  
Where Steinbeck found the valley  
  
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley  
  
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores  
  
Where the farmhouse used to be  
  
There the monarch's autumn journey ends  
  
On a windswept cyprus tree  
  
Water getwater get yourself in that  
  
Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water  
  
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place  
  
Get yourself in that water  
  
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation?  
  
Where Country Joe will do his show  
  
And he'd sing about liberty  
  
And the people there in the open air, one big family.  
  
Yeah the people there love to sing and share  
  
Their new found liberty

Otis Redding

Remember me  
Don't you forget me, child  
We are all only here  
Just for a little while  
  
Do you remember the girl?  
The girl that you were dating  
Keep all your ?  
And then you walked away  
  
Oh yes, he did now

You were cripple and you were lame  
I stood by your bed time till you  
Were on your feet again  
  
Oh yes, I did now  
Oh yes, I did  
  
Oh, somewhere oh down the line  
You are gonna see this little heart of mine  
Is so large, so wonderful, so true  
  
Oh now, somewhere  
Brighter days you're gonna see  
What a big mistake that you made  
  
I said I'm a begging you  
I said I'm a begging you  
I said I'm pleading, pleading, pleading  
  
Remember me  
Don't you forget me, child  
We are all only here  
Just for a little while  
  
Oh yes, we're here now, oh yes, we're here  
I need a little of your love everyday  
I need you to sit and to talk to me right now  
  
Every second, every minute, every hour of the day  
I need you to hold my little trembling hand  
I need you to just stand right by  
Oh, my, my, my

R. Kelly

[Chorus]  
I been around the world  
And gets nothing but love  
For who I am  
I thank my fans so much  
Even though some may hate  
Still I appreciate  
All my friends and family  
That kept it real with me  
  
I been around the world and back like what up  
East side to west side touring like what up  
And even though the price for the house was so much  
I still roll with them from the hood like what up  
Cause when it comes to being the realest I'm sure 'nough  
I'm a straight up industry villain for sure 'nough  
And I can't satisfy some a y'all no matter what  
And some of y'all cats are so jealous  
Said we livin in a cold cold world  
Ain't nothin' but fake faces fake people fake friends  
Said we living in a cold cold world  
Where there ain't nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas  
Yea I know I need a hug but y'all need a hug too  
'cause god gunna judge me the same day he judge you  
And even though we have our struggles that's alright  
You know we get our folks and find a way to shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ja Rule]  
Sometimes this world can be so cold  
When you looking through the windows of the soul  
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds  
Cause I been around this globe and back  
Enough to know the fact  
Who loves me  
And who loves me not  
We be shit's so hot  
You could put it in red tops  
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block  
Until they heart stops  
That's why they fiend for me  
And I thank you for every blessing that you giving me lord  
And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords  
And all these haters I keep shaking 'em off  
Rubbing they face in fame  
I'm sorry I changed the game  
But its mine and I can't complain  
Rule and are Kelly  
Been around the world  
Putting it on women  
Bumping and grinding these bitches  
But we always on time when a woman fed up  
And that's love  
That's why they all fuck wit us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said my lyrics is my testimony  
That's how I live  
I had to get rid of a lot of fake homies  
Over the years  
You see me on TV sometimes  
Not how it is  
Y'all gotta start learning how to separate me from showbiz  
When I'm rolling through your city  
Show me love  
And ladies when you see a boy  
Give me love  
And though I'm not conceited (right)  
Its just my space sometimes I need it (right)  
Said I got so many friends in them area codes  
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows  
Ja lets break bread together  
Pray together  
That we grow strong together  
Its clear forever  
Help each other through the stormy weather  
Lets hurt together  
Lets cry together  
And even if we grow together  
Then together we'll make it better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said I been around the world  
And gets nothing but love  
For who I am  
I thank my fans so much  
Even though some may hate  
Still I appreciate  
All my friends and family  
That kept it real with me

Fuck ya head up more than that bullshit ya smokin'  
Niggas buzz you in the door but I blew it open  
Ya rhymes is trash that verse ain't worth a token  
Try to hop this, monotonous, murderous thoughts  
When I'm plottin' this, overthrow the government  
Burn the whole metropolis, lyrical warfare  
Hip-hop Apocalypse, strap devils to the chairs  
Start shockin' shit, Q you, I chew through  
We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue  
Flex could get one too, the wait, I'm supplyin'  
My crew pop, they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion  
I'm ready for the showdown  
Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down  
I blow through your clique like Hurricane Floyd  
Keep rappers paranoid, kept your bodies in the game  
Is something I can't avoid, shit get tricky like Siegfried and Roy  
I seek and destroy

I'ma blaze y'all niggas and represent Queens  
Run up in ya cribs, fill ya tubs with gasoline  
Smash ya plaques, tie ya arms back  
What's ya worse nightmare, Black? I'm beyond that  
The mic, how I strike it, got 'em dialin' psychics  
Roll with minds, don't give a fuck if you don't like it  
With niggas that's invited without recited, ignited  
It burn mad slow and that's why I'll easily light it  
Me and the ghettos reunited, all the broads is excited  
Your ass looks stupid, tryna fight it  
You wanna get your ass smacked up  
So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up  
But when my Queens, niggas flashed then you backed up  
Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up  
It's the L, nigga, dot com, dot hot lead red dot on your head be  
And the rappers you idolized that idolized me  
I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea  
And Todd's Shop of Horrors, we battle to the death tonight  
There's no tomorrow, I'm out for revenge  
Like the rebels in Nicaragua but I can take it farther  
Travel back in time, fill ya baby bottle with lava  
Queens got the vets

We work hard so we can play hard and push them big things  
Persistent, we keep comin' like some nigs  
Droppin' albums, every few years we rich  
We the best, we the vets  
We do this for the love, we thirst for that street shit  
It's P, nigga, check my record, it's flawless  
Do the knowledge to the chorus, yeah you fuckin' right  
While I was raised on my fuckin' life  
I did my time on them corners, now I lead the fuckin' life  
Large dollars, guns and ice  
Is nothin' you know my weight and the price of it  
You know how the Q dogs do cousin  
We don't follow trends, we set those so get up on it  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens got the vets  
Queens be the best  
Queens take ya heads

Don't Turn Around
Tina Turner
----------------
If you want to leave I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling maybe it's better that way  
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door, see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I won't miss your arms around me holding me tight  
If you ever think about me just know that I'll be alright  
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive, sure I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you  
I wish I could say to you don't go, don't go, don't go  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know

Sweet Talking Woman
Electric Light Orchestra
----------------
I was searching (searching) on a one-way street  
I was hoping (hoping) for a chance to meet  
I was waiting for the operator on the line  
(She's gone so long) What can I do?  
(Where could she be?) no, no, no, don't know what I'm gonna do

You gotta slow down (slow down) sweet talking woman (slow down)  
You got me running (run, run)

Hold on (hold on) sweet talking lover (hold on)  
It's so sad if that's the way it's over  
  
I was (walking) many days go by  
I was thinking (thinking) about the lonely nights  
Communication breakdown all around

Recovery
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
I live on an island far away  
All by myself, there's no one else  
Nobody calls but that's okay  
Don't need their help, I'm by myself  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me, deserting me  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  
When I go wrong as people do  
There's only me to answer to  
Nobody here to bring me down  
No feelings I need step around  
Trouble and care are waiting out there  
But I'm alright, I'm safe tonight  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  
Don't need your sympathy, save all your tears  
I've lived without tenderness for too many years  
Why would I need it now?  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me, deserting me  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery

Take Me
Reo Speedwagon
----------------
I always wondered if I could give  
Enough love for a woman to live on  
But as I grow, as I learn and live,  
I find it's best to forget and forgive.  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean.  
I could be singing to the sea.  
But I am poetry in motion.  
I'm yours!  
  
When I was young I was so filled with love,  
Jealousy stung but never deep enough  
'Cause I feel rain falling from above.  
I only thirst for your to share my cup.  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean.  
I could be singing to the sea.  
But I am poetry in motion.  
I'm yours, people. Take me.

Christmas In The Trenches
John McDermott
----------------
How can I go on  
When I know I gave it all  
Have I given too much?  
Something inside your heart is pushing me aside  
And it seems so on you baby  
But it's so hard on me  
What is it I'm seeing in your eyes?  
The story that I'm reading says goodbye  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
Searching for answers  
But they're oh so hard to find  
'Cause I'm still loving you, baby  
Oh, are you still loving me?  
Baby don't you turn and close the door  
Is it you don't love me any more?  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
Don't leave me now, all alone  
Don't bring me down  
'Cause I'm not that strong  
I need your love to carry on  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye

Far Away Eyes
Rolling Stones
----------------
I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield  
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station  
And the preacher said, "You know you always have the Lord by your side"  
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran  
Twenty red lights in his honor  
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord  
  
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late  
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off  
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find  
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin' in the corner  
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear  
Was a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if you're down on your luck  
And you can't harmonize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if you're downright disgusted  
And life ain't worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send  
Ten dollars to the church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart Of Jesus  
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California  
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio  
And all my dreams would come true  
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl  
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got, well I'll tell ya  
  
So if you're down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if you're downright disgusted  
And life ain't worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if you're down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes

Rockin' Horse
Allman Brothers Band
----------------
"My gaurdian angel wears a hard hat,"  
Said the boy with the microphone  
"Else, I wouldn't be standing here today  
Ever since I was a little young a boy  
I couldn't leave well enough alone  
When trouble standing in my way  
  
Up, down, anywhere but in the middle  
Off the wagon, under the wheel again  
All or nothing - never could do just alittle  
Never could leave it alone  
  
Hard living be the death of me  
Yes gonna lead me to an early grave  
To die in the saddle must be my destiny  
But to ride this rocking horse I must be crazed  
  
Good clean fun is just my imagination  
Down and dirty that's the way the game is played  
This hard life has caused me aggravation  
Never could leave it alone  
Ohh no now baby  
Can't leave it alone  
Ohh I gotta ride that rocking horse  
  
Talking, about my guardian angel, she wears a hard hat  
Wouldn't be standing here today  
Ever since I was a little bitty young boy  
Been trouble standing in my way  
  
Up, down, anywhere but in the middle  
Off the wagon, under the wheel again  
All or nothing - never could do just alittle  
Never could leave it alone  
Ohh now now now baby  
Can't leave it alone  
Gotta ride my rockin' horse

Once A Day
Loretta Lynn
----------------
When you found somebody new I thought I never would  
Forget you for I thought then I never could  
But time has taken all the pains away  
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day  
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn  
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long  
[ piano ]  
I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time  
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind  
She sat around and cried her life away  
Oh lucky me I'm only cryin' once a day  
Once a day all day long...  
Once a day every day all day long

Getchoo
Weezer
----------------
This is beginning to hurt  
This is beginning to be serious  
It used to be a game  
Now it's a cryin' shame  
'cause you don't want to play around no more  
  
Sometimes I push too hard  
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee  
I never meant to do  
All that I've done to you  
Please baby say it's not too late  
To get you, uh-huh  
  
You know this is breakin' me up  
You think that I'm some kind of freak  
But if you'd come back to me  
Then you would surely see  
That I'm just foolin' around  
  
To get you, uh-huh  
  
I can't believe  
What you've done to me  
What I did do them  
You've done to me

Falling In Falling Out
Status Quo
----------------
Oh no I took your number down  
Now I can't find it and I'm back in town  
Tonight tonight  
I can't believe where the hell it's gone  
And looking for a lover won't be too much fun  
Tonight tonight  
  
I'm standing in line again  
Wasting my time  
I know I'd feel fine again  
With you on the line  
With you on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm falling in, falling out  
I still don't know what it's all about  
I'm falling in, falling out  
I'm creeping in, but I'm crawling out again  
Falling in, falling out  
I'm giving up, so I'm calling out to you  
  
I bet you're thinking you where just a game  
I bet you bet I can't recall your name  
Tonight tonight  
How can I tell if I can't get through?  
How can I make it if I'm not with you?  
Tonight tonight  
  
I'm standing in line again  
Wasting my time  
I know I'd feel fine again  
With you on the line  
With you on the line  
  
[Chorus: x3]

A Sense Of Humor
David Allan Coe
----------------
Every night another woman every day a different town  
If I'm not accused of speeding I'm accused of coming down  
With a legal dose of something that you heard was going round  
And you wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Every song another record every day just like a clock  
Knowing well I've had to take it till I make it to the top  
With the devil right behind me and my heart about to stop  
Then you wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Twenty years I was in prison more than that I was alone  
Some lily-white reporter thinks it's time that I was stoned  
Without sin he wrote the story and it chilled me to the bone  
Then he wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
I shaved my beard and cut my hair off it don't matter anyhow  
It was truth that told the answers to the questions up till now  
Crucify him someone shouted from the safety of the crowd  
Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Hey take them crosses from my doorstep there's no reason to my rhyme  
Everybody knows somebody will take care of me in time  
I made friends of all you stand for but the blind can't lead the blind  
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor  
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor  
Cause if I ever catch you I'm gonna kick your ass

To Get To You
Engelbert Humperdinck
----------------
I would walk on all my friends to get to you  
If I lose them all for your love, I'll do that, too  
Guess they mean well when they tell me what to do  
But they don't know how far I'll go to get to you  
  
Burning bridges behind me to get to you  
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you  
I hold your love far above what I'd go through  
I'd give all I own for a stepping stone to get to you  
  
If it's the last I do, I'll get to you  
Because I know how much you want me to  
You're the only thing that can me my world in view  
Every breath I take, every move I make, is to get to you  
  
Burning bridges behind me to get to you  
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you  
I hold your love far above what I'd go through  
I'd give all I own for a stepping stone to get to you

Disconnected
Face To Face
----------------
You don't know a thing about me  
Is there something that you should know?  
I can tell you what you want to hear  
Let you inhibitions just go  
No you don't know what you will give up  
You don't know what you want  
It may take you years to find out  
  
You don't know what you need  
It's something that may never come to you  
Trust is something that comes easy  
When you've never been a victim  
Lies and promises and words are said  
It's your decision to accept them

Natural Woman
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
Looking out on the morning rain  
  
I used to feel so uninspired  
  
And when I knew I had to face another day  
  
Lord, it made me feel, made me feel so tired  
  
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind  
  
But you're the key to my peace of mind  
  
  
  
'cause you make me feel  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman  
  
  
  
Oh, baby, what you've done to me  
  
Ooh, you make me feel so good inside  
  
And I just don't want to be close to you  
  
You make me feel so aliive  
  
  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman

King
Marillion
----------------
How long can you stand  
Tightening up  
Avoiding the fight  
Avoiding the truth  
Tighten the smile  
Tighten the lie  
Will you get what you want  
To be cursed with your dreams  
I hope for your sake  
Something gets in the way  
  
How long can you stand  
Living under the lens  
The kiss of success  
The ensuing, all consuming, mess  
  
Message of love  
They arrive everyday  
People you touch  
Wasting away  
People you don't know  
Give you no choice  
  
And you're sick to your stomach  
At the sound of your voice  
And the shape of your face  
And the sound of your name  
They send you pictures of yourself  
It's someone you don't know  
And they call you a genius  
Cause you're easier to sell  
But the fire in your belly  
That gave you the songs  
Is suddenly gone  
And you feel like a fake  
Is that what you want?  
  
I hope for your sake  
You've got what it takes  
You've got what it takes  
To be spoilt to death.

Love Is A Battlefield
Pat Benatar
----------------
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises, no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
(Woah)  
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong  
Searchin' our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield  
  
You're beggin' me to go then makin' me stay  
Why do you hurt me so bad  
It would help me to know  
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had  
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why  
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side  
  
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises, no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong  
Searchin' our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We're losing control  
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside  
And when all this gets old, will it still feel the same  
There's no way this will die  
But if we get much closer, I could lose control  
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold  
  
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises, no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong  
Searchin' our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield

Just Enough To Keep Me Hangin' On
Cher
----------------
It's true, you got me wrapped around your finger  
Ah honey, it seems that's where I belong  
You know how to hold me, thrill me and control me  
Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Ah honey, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
  
My heart is like a yo-yo string  
I'm tied to you, I'm tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps on growing  
Cause your love keeps right on showing  
Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Oh baby, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
  
A love as true as mine will make you do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches  
And dreaming all those silly dreams  
Ah honey, you got me, you got me where you want me  
And you keep me stringing along  
  
Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Ah baby, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Ah honey, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Oh tell me why, just enough

Scream!
Misfits
----------------
A chill runs up your spine  
It crawls into your brain  
The freezing touch of fear  
  
It's driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
'Til you... Scream  
  
Scream  
I can't wait to hear you  
I can't wait to hear you  
Scream  
  
It's driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
'Til you... Scream  
  
Scream  
I can't wait to hear you  
I can't wait to hear you  
Scream

All Stood Still
Ultravox
----------------
The lights went out (The last fuse blew).  
The clocks all stopped (It can't be true).  
The program's wrong (What can we do?).  
The printout's blocked (It relied on you).  
The turbine cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Please remember to mention me,  
In tapes you leave behind.  
Chorus :  
We stood still.  
We all stood still.  
Still stood still.  
We're standing still.  
The screen shut down (There's no reply).  
The lifts all fall (A siren cries).  
And the radar fades (A pilot sighs).  
As the countdowns stall (The readout lies).  
The turbines cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Please remember to mention me,  
In tapes you leave behind.  
(Chorus)  
The black box failed (The codes got crossed).  
And the jails decayed (The keys got lost).  
Everyone kissed (We breathe exhaust).  
In the new arcade (Of the holocaust).  
The turbine cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Plese remember to mention me,  
In tapes you might leave behind.  
(Chorus - Repeat 2 times).

Sharing The Same Dreams
Regine Velasquez
----------------
We found each other  
But little did we know  
That in truth, my sisters  
Togetherness can make love grow  
We're always better together  
Than when we're apart  
We're sharing the same dreams in our hearts  
We're sharin'  
Sharin' the same dreams  
Yes! You and me  
And good things  
Good things will happen  
If we wait, wait and see  
We'll make it together  
Sink or swim  
And neither one of us will be  
Out on alimb  
We're sharin', sharin' the same dreams  
Yes! You and me  
We may be different  
But then that's who we are  
Just remember my sisters  
We're reachin' for that lucky star  
We share the same joy and laughter sadness and tears  
We're stayin' together for years and years.

Man mein kisi ki preet basaale

Preet banaale ye jivan ko ek suhaanaa sapanaa  
Ek suhaanaa sapanaa  
Jivan mein ye jyot jagaale  
O matwaale O matwaale  
Man mein kisi ki preet basaale  
  
Preet sataaye preet rulaaye  
Jiyaa mein aag lagaaye  
Jalnewaalaa hanste hanste phir bhi jaltaa jaaye  
Phir bhi jaltaa jaaye  
Preet ke hai andaaz niraale  
O matwaale O matwaale  
Man mein kisi ki preet basaale

Stained Glass
Keith Green
----------------
We are like windows  
Stained with colors of the rainbow  
Set in a darkened room  
Till the bridegroom comes to shining through  
  
Then the colors fall around our feet  
Over those we meet  
Covering all the gray that we see  
Rainbow colors of assorted hues  
Come exchange your blues  
For His love that you see shining through me  
  
We are His daughters and sons  
We are the colorful ones  
We are the kids of the King  
Rejoice in everything  
  
My colors grow so dim  
When I start to fall away from Him  
But up comes the strongest wind  
That he sends to blow me back into his arms again  
  
And then the colors fall around my feet  
Over those I meet  
Changing all the gray that I see  
Rainbow colors of the Risen Son  
Reflect the One  
The One who came to set us all free  
  
We are His daughters and sons  
We are the colorful ones  
We are the kids of the King  
Rejoice in everything  
  
We are like windows  
Stained with colors of the rainbow  
No longer set in a darkened room  
Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you  
  
No longer set in a darkened room  
Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you

Lucifer Sam
Pink Floyd
----------------
Lucifer Sam, Siam cat.  
Always sitting by your side  
Always by your side.  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
Ginger the gentle you're the witch.  
You're the left side  
He's the right side.  
Oh, no!  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
Lucifer go to sea.  
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.  
Somewhere, anywhere.  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
At night prowling sifting sand.  
Hiding around on the ground.  
He'll be found when you're around.  
That cat's something I can't explain.

I Fought The Law
Roy Orbison
----------------
I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i needed money ''cause i had none  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won  
I left my baby and i feel so bad, i guess my race is run  
She's the best girl i ever had, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i was robbing people with a six gun  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won  
I miss my baby and good fun, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i left my baby and i feel so bad  
I guess my race is run, she's the best girl i ever had  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won

Call On Me
Michael Jackson
----------------
There goes the sunshine  
Here comes the rain  
And heartache things  
What can I do but wait for you  
Darling the days  
I had looked cold  
  
Now our separate mays we go  
It seems you want more  
Than the love I can give  
But I can't make you stay  
  
And you got your life to live  
But if it gets too rough  
Call on me  
  
Dreams of golden glare  
Taking you away from here  
But if ever think that has to be  
Turns your dreams around  
  
Love and understanding is what you need  
If you can't get enough  
Call on me  
  
I'm so sad you're leaving  
It's going to kill me  
Not to be with you?  
But I want you to be happy  
  
If parting is what you want  
Then I want it too  
So goodbye with all my best  
For your happiness in a world that's there  
  
Should you write and it's not there  
Call on me  
(Call on me)  
  
Yes, happiness  
Wish you for elsewhere  
We remember this should  
You write and it's not there  
Call on me... call on me  
  
Yes, happiness  
Wish you for elsewhere  
We remember this should  
You write and it's not there  
Call on me...

God Rests In Reason
Jason Mraz
----------------
You were born together and together ye shall be forever  
Until death could scatter  
Shouldn't matter in the memory of god above  
Let the wind of heaven dance between you too  
Allowing time and space to bring you closer to everlasting love  
So what should you do if god moves through you?  
  
When love beckons its ways are often hard and steep  
And his wings unfold, ye yield to all that it speaks  
Though a sword it might be hidden there among the pinions  
Oh you, may wear a wound that truly spoke to you  
Believe in all that voice and follow through  
So what should you do when god moves through you?  
  
Love possesses nothing  
Nor would it ever be possessed  
Love is love sufficient unto love  
And you can figure out the rest  
  
God rests in reason  
So what should you do, oh, oh  
When god moves through you?  
  
Well, your children will not be your children  
Maybe the daughter, the son of a beginning  
They'll come through your womb but not be coming from you  
They will be with you but they do not belong to you  
  
You can give them your love but not your thoughts  
'Cause they'll arrive with their own hearts  
They're the coming of angels this blessed season  
And then they'll sing oh yea, god rests in reason  
God rests in reason  
So what should you do when god moves through you?  
  
And think not you can direct the course of  
Love itself directs the course of love  
Believe not god is in your heart, child  
But rather you're in the heart of god  
  
So you see so far I'm all right  
Pleasant and awkwardly polite  
Watching carefully the comedy  
The tick tock moments of the grid lock day  
  
And why I'm singing  
About the fact that I'm giving up everything  
And giving back to the people that made me want to change  
My evil, lazy ways  
I'm gonna give you one more phrase to explain  
  
See I believe in only one thing  
I believe in good orderly D I are E C T I O N  
I'll spell it again, roll it with abbreviation  
Easy as a 1 2 3  
Spell it backwards it's a D O G  
'Cause it's a dog eat dog world  
What a life girl, maybe you should make you my wife girl  
  
And I believe in omni possibility  
It's nothing more than good orderly direction  
Nothing more than good orderly direction  
Nothing more than good orderly direction  
This is nothing more than good orderly direction  
So what should you do when god moves through you?  
What should you do when god moves through you?

The Past
Korn
----------------
You chose to take  
From the past  
You want a game  
That's built to last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You chose to take  
From the past  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything even you my friend  
  
You wanna lay  
In the past  
You'll do anything  
To make your pain last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You just take  
From the past  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything even you my friend  
  
Run away, go away [Repeat: x30]  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything with you my friend  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
Is this the end?

When The Going Gets Dark
Quasi
----------------
When you told me if you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
I was thinking death before dishonor  
As you lord over your front porch  
Getting drunk with your neighbor  
Well I might wander all day  
Across the Milky Way  
But I'll be Joan of Arc when the going gets dark  
  
Why buy a trip across the ocean  
When you could already be the sea?  
  
And they'll tell you sign up with the winning team  
Or get out of the way, get with the program  
Welcome to the real world!  
Is that what is real  
Or is it just that the standard deal?  
You can have all of that  
That ain't where it's at  
  
Why buy a trip across the ocean  
When you could already be the sea?

Marie
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
I stood in line and left my name  
Took about six hours or so  
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game  
Said they'd let me know  
I put in my time till the Pocono line  
Shut down two years ago  
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie  
Now I can't stay there no more  
  
Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man  
To move some old cars around  
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out  
Van and do a little settlin' down  
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride  
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways  
That job's about a half week old besides  
It'd be gone now anyway  
  
Unemployment said I got no more checks  
And they showed me to the hall  
My brother died in Georgia some time ago  
I got no one left to call  
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge  
A little short on food that's all  
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat  
We're headed down into fall  
  
I used to play the mouth harp pretty good  
Hustled up a little dough  
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled  
A couple of months ago  
They got my harp and they got my dollar  
Them low life so and so's  
Harps cost money and I ain't got it  
It's my own fault I suppose  
  
The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'  
Two freights everyday  
If it was just me I'd be headed south  
But Marie can't catch no train  
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,  
Says we gotta wait and see  
In my heart I know it's a little boy  
Hope he don't end up like me  
  
Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file  
I gotta stand in line again  
I want to kill him but I just say no  
I had enough of that line my friend  
I head back to the bridge, it's getting kinda cold  
I'm feelin' too low down to lie  
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth  
Hope she don't break down and cry  
  
Marie she didn't wake up this morning  
She didn't even try  
She just rolled over and went to heaven  
My little boy safe inside  
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them  
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly  
Marie will know I'm headed south  
So's to meet me by and by  
Marie will know I'm headed south  
So to meet me by and by.

White Christmas
Bob Marley
----------------
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all  
Your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white  
Christmas with you  
Jingle Bells  
All the way, all the way

Countin' The Cows Every Day
Jimmy Buffett
----------------
Countin the cows every day  
By: jimmy buffett  
1975  
Oh I'm just a cowboy, an old hired hand  
Never seen nothin majestic or grand  
I just received a great big tax return  
Now I'm off to las vegas with money to burn  
  
Its been a while since I last left this town  
Bought a new suit and I'm nevada bound  
Gonna make it, gonna break it, I've been there before  
Nothins gone wrong, this towns such a bore  
  
Chorus:  
Aw, the train leaves at seven, all go to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah, the train leaves at seven, on up to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
And countin the cows every day

Carnal Question
Gino Vannelli
----------------
If I came back just a cripple from the war  
Would you hold me close just like you did before?  
And what in the world would you do  
If I could not make love to you?  
  
The question is not whether the freedom we've got  
Is worth the consequence of war  
The question is just, can I hold you at dusk  
Without you asking me for more?  
  
A post-war eunuch  
A lover that is lame  
Some famous hero, and one shares his name  
But where in the world would I go?  
You're all that I love and all I know  
  
The question is plain  
Could our love still remain  
Without its carnal ecstasy?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
And who in the world would I be  
If I lose all of you and half of me?  
  
Oh

Mcdonald's Girl
Inside Out
----------------
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
I leave from softball practice every night.  
It's getting dark but the golden arches light up the way.  
I turn the corner at the traffic light.  
I count my money and I rehearse what I'm gonna say:  
I'd like an order of fries,  
And Quarter-Pounder with Cheese,  
I love the light in your eyes,  
Will you go out with me please?  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
She doesn't try to impress anyone.  
She doesn't try to be tough  
Like all the girls that I know.  
She doesn't treat me like a simpleton.  
I wanna say how I feel,  
If I could just let go.  
And when my hamburgers cold,  
I get up ready to go,  
She's only 16 years old,  
And I'm in love with her so.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
There she stands behind the register.  
Taking orders from the  
Provo City Little League.  
If they knew how much I wanted her,  
Their home room teacher would have  
To send them home for a week.  
And when I head for the door, the  
Moonlight catches her eyes.  
My heart begins to soar, she smiles  
And waves goodbye. Goodbye  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform. What a babe.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
I am in love with a McDonald's Girl.

How Long Will It Take
Loretta Lynn
----------------
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me  
I keep a waiting and a wondering how long will it take  
Well you keep a telling me your love I'm winning  
Then you turn right around and you treat me hard and cold  
Well I ain't got but one life here I'm living  
So if you're gonna love me baby I've gotta know  
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you want me  
How much longer has this old heart gotta break  
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me  
I keep a waiting and a wondering how long will it take  
  
Now there ain't a thing on earth that don't need a loving  
And baby I'm no exception to the rule  
But if you keep a putting everything above me  
Well how in this world will I ever get through to you  
(How long will it take)

Sailing Ships
Whitesnake
----------------
Do you remember  
Standing on the shore,  
Head in the clouds,  
Your pockets filled with dreams  
Bound for glory  
On the seven seas of life,  
But, the ocean is deeper than it seems  
  
The wind was with you  
When you left on the morning tide,  
You set your sail for an island in the sun,  
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead,  
For the storm has just begun  
  
Take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
Lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water,  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
You're the one who holds the key,  
Or sailing ships will pass you by  
  
You cry for mercy,  
When you think you've lost your way,  
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone  
So find the strength and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
After all is said and done  
  
So take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
An' lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water,  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
You're the one who holds the key,  
Or sailing ships will pass,  
Sailing ships will pass you,  
Sailing ships will pass you by  
  
Take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
We'll ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
So sailing ships don't pass you by  
  
So take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
We'll ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
So sailing ships don't pass,  
So sailing ships don't pass you,  
So sailing ships don't pass you by  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby,  
You'll find that you're the only one  
Can sail your ship across the sky

Stars
Kylie Minogue
----------------
[Verse 1]  
You're asking yourself, what's real?  
What to do with these feelings  
That you have inside surreal  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
When you look deep into the pockets of the universe  
You never know what you find  
Because stars don't shine in singular places  
Open up your mind's eye and  
Light up familiar faces  
Because in time  
You'll find life and all of its races  
So open up your mind's eye  
And go tonight  
Begin to feel the light  
  
[Verse 2]  
How do we know the truth?  
Gotta look to the root  
Inside the meaning of life for you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
  
[Verse 3]  
You never know what you find  
Because stars don't shine in singular places  
Open up your mind's eye and  
Light up familiar faces  
Because in time  
You'll find life and all of its races  
So open up your mind's eye  
And go tonight  
Begin to feel the light  
  
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight  
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight  
Yeah, familiar faces  
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight

Toothless People
Weird Al Yankovic
----------------
They only show you their gums when they smile  
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now, how vile  
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce  
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss  
  
Hey, stand up  
Toothless people, their breath is lethal, want to tell you  
Hey, come on, stand up, get on your feet  
Toothless people, old and feeble, what I say  
  
No more of those pearly whites will they possess  
Their oral hygiene is frightful, a mess  
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease  
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities  
  
Hey, stand up, take out your teeth  
Toothless people, old and feeble, oh yes  
  
You can brush 'em, you can floss 'em  
They're something you just can't ignore  
If you lose 'em, you're in trouble  
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more  
You need something to show your dentist  
The next time he makes you say "Ah"  
You don't want to have to wind up  
Eating all of your food through a straw  
  
(Like toothless people, toothless people)  
You'd better brush your teeth now (hey)  
Toothless, toothless, toothless, toothless people  
Hey, stand up, toothless people

You Better Hang Up
Don Henley
----------------
Out here in the country where the weather gets so mean  
She thinks about the places that she ain't never seen  
She knows that she's married but she can't remember why  
And she wonders what it might feel like with some other guy  
  
And though she's hotter than an oven  
Just to fill your lovin' cup  
If a man answers, you better hang up  
  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
  
You're from New York City where they don't say no prayers  
Anything goes and nobody cares  
And the country girl might thrill ya but you better pass her by  
'Cause her ol' man love to kill ya for the look that's in your eye  
  
And though you're hotter than an oven  
Just to fill her lovin' cup  
If a man answers, you better hang up  
  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up

The Twentieth Century Is Almost Over
John Prine
----------------
Back in 1899, when everyone was singing "auld lang syne"  
A century took a long, long time for every boy and girl.  
Now there's only one thing that I'd like to know  
Where did the 20th century go?  
I'd swear it was here just a minute ago  
All over this world.  
  
Chorus:  
And now the 20th century is almost over,  
Almost over, almost over  
The 20th century is almost over  
All over this world.  
All over this world, all over this world  
The 20th century is almost over, all over this world.  
  
Does anyone remember the great depression?  
I read all about it in true confession  
I'm sorry I was late for the recording session  
But somebody put me on hold.  
Has anybody seen my linoleum floors  
Petroleum jelly, and two world wars?  
They got stuck in the revolving doors  
All over this world.  
And now...  
  
The winter's getting colder, summer's getting hotter  
Wishin' well's wishin' for another drop of water.  
And mother earth's blushin'' 'cause somebody caught her  
Makin' love to the man in the moon.  
Tell me how you gonna keep 'em down on the farm  
Now that outer space has lost it's charm?  
Somebody set off a burglar alarm  
And not a moment too soon.  
Because...  
  
Old father time has got his toes a tappin'  
Standing in the window, grumblin' and a rappin'  
Everybody's waiting for something to happen.  
Tell me if it happens to you!  
The judgment day is getting nearer  
There it is in the rear view mirror.  
If you duck down I could see a little clearer  
All over this world!  
And now...

Tha politricks who rob and hold down your zone?  
Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes?  
Tha pig who's free to murder one Shucklak  
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?  
  
This mic device  
I spit nonfiction  
Who got tha power  
This be my question  
Tha mass of tha few in this torn nation?  
Tha priest tha book or tha congregation?  
Tha politricks who rob and hold down your zone?  
Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes?  
Tha pig who's free to murder one Shucklak  
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?  
  
Mic Check, ha ha ha  
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker  
Mic Check, ha ha ha ha  
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?  
Mic Check, ha ha ha  
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker  
Mic Check, ha ha ha ha  
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?

Magic
Coldplay
----------------
Call it magic, call it true  
I call it magic when I'm with you  
And I just got broken, broken into two  
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you  
  
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Call it magic, cut me into two  
And with all your magic, I disappear from view  
And I can't get over, can't get over you  
Still, I call it magic, such a precious truth  
  
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
Wanna fall, I fall so far  
I wanna fall, fall so hard  
And I call it magic  
And I call it true  
Call it magic  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
And if you were to ask me  
After all that we've been through  
"Still believe in magic?"  
Well yes, I do  
Oh yes, I do  
Oh yes, I do  
Oh yes, I do  
Of course I do

Cindy's Lament
Rod Stewart
----------------
Listen here  
You don't have to love me always Cindy  
You don't need to see me every day of the week  
You don't have to notice my brand new shoes  
But please, please say hello some time  
  
You know I've tried to impress you Cindy  
I even lent ya my library book  
I guess you forgot, good God you soon forgot it woman  
I don't mind but please say hello some time  
  
And your mother she can't stand my face  
And your brother keeps me from your door  
But I'll stay around yes I'll stay around honey  
I'll even watch over your garden fence  
  
I've watched your friends Cindy laugh in my face  
But I won't apologize for the way that I am  
If only they knew baby, yes if only they knew  
That you've already spent one night with me honey

Lucretia
Megadeth
----------------
Sitting up, late at night  
I tiptoe through the darkness  
Cold as hell, black as spades  
Aware of my immediate surrounding  
In my place I escape up into my hideout  
Hiding from everyone  
My friends all say,  
"Dave you're mental anyway" hey!  
Drift into a deeper state  
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways  
Dirt grits between my feet  
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak  
Hypnosis guides my hand  
I slipside through the walkways  
Sit in granny's rockin' chair  
Memories are whirling by, yeah  
Reminisce in the attic  
Lucretia waits impatiently  
Cobwebs make me squint  
The cobra so eloquently glints  
Moonbeams surge through the sky  
The crystal ball's energized  
Surely that like the cat waiting  
Lucretia rocks away

I Am The Audience
XTC
----------------
I am the audience  
There's no doubt, no consequence  
I could make the morning papers  
If I use my capers  
Let's be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected, as the audience...  
  
Oh I...am the audience  
No doubt, no consequence  
Cause I'm the audience  
  
Let's be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected  
I am the audience  
Breakdown the pretence  
No longer be silent  
Let's turn to violence  
  
I am the audience

Happy Endings
Jason Mraz
----------------
You are naked  
Standing at the other end of this  
Poison arrow  
I am William tell  
And you are the girl with the golden apple  
And you are hungry to be swept off your feet  
You wanna do this out in the open  
But my aim is often weak  
And you fear my shoulders sloping  
Your split ends will end up falling anyway  
Before the weight of the apple world  
Gets to turn them all grey  
And your eyes they need  
Calming down  
  
Well you are wise  
And you are free  
To let the apple touch the ground  
Or keep it standing tall  
Cause this won't hurt at all  
  
You are half asleep  
You're half of a girl  
And half of a child  
Maybe five feet deep  
You're as tall as the world  
Up to your eyes  
And you've been hogging all the sheets  
Often balling them up  
Even drawing a line  
And spending half of your time  
Deciding to roll over  
When you do  
  
I'll be there with a smile  
Expanding far and wide  
And I pull you in much closer  
In my dreams you are queen of the ball  
And sometimes you off my head  
Well to me it's a happy ending  
For you I'd fall  
Cause that wouldn't hurt at all  
Not at all  
  
While this woman is sleeping here  
I tell her what I can't if I were to wake her  
Powerful but hardly will she ever hear the,  
The secrets I've saved up  
  
Well you are famous indeed  
For all your shyness  
Ain't that sweet  
Ain't this a fine mess  
We're in so deep  
I must've got lost in the process  
Just let things be easy  
And an honest boy you've made me  
Because the solice that you gave me  
Was proven problems ain't the main thing to fall apart  
The archers sloping shoulders  
Well any story's tale is tall  
Thus reminding love is allegorical  
I mean the goal here after all  
Is not to hurt at all

Learn To Listen
Ramones
----------------
You gotta learn to listen, listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned  
Learn to listen, listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned  
  
You gotta have fun, not a fix in the arm  
You gotta stay out of deep water  
Happiness is something you've gotta earn  
You gotta fight to make your love into returns  
  
Learn to listen, listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned  
  
You got the rights and there's always a temptation  
This one more screwed up the nation  
Gotta have a plan, gotta learn to listen  
Gotta take a stab, you have my blessing, alright  
  
You gotta take the cotton out of your ears  
You gotta start hanging on to all your affairs  
I've lived your life for so many years  
All I got was self-pity and tears

Bossa Nova, Baby
Elvis Presley
----------------
I said, "Take it easy, baby  
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead  
You got my shirt tails  
Flyin' all over the place  
And the sweat poppin' out of my head"  
  
She said, "Hey, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on a workin', child  
This ain't no time to quit"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
I'm about to have myself a fit"  
Bossa Nova, Bossa Nova  
  
I said, "Hey, little mama  
Let's sit down  
Have a drink and dig the band"  
  
She said, "Drink, drink, drink  
Oh, fiddle-de-dink  
I can dance with a drink in my hand"  
She said, "Hey, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin', child  
This ain't no time to drink"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
'Cause I ain't got time to think"  
  
I said, "Come on, baby  
It's hot in here  
And it's oh-so cool outside  
If you lend me a dollar  
I can buy some gas  
And we can go for a little ride"  
  
She said, "Hey Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin', child  
I ain't got time for that"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
Or I'll find myself another cat"

So Gone
John Legend
----------------
I'm a do my thing  
I'm a do, I'm a do, I'm a do my thing  
  
I was born at the end of december  
Not afraid that the cold of the winter  
Would keep me inside, hey  
Ever since mama left me at home  
I had to search for a class of my own  
And go there in my mind  
  
I had a dream like dr. King  
I had a song I had to sing  
And I knew it wasn't make believe  
When the teacher said to me  
Baby, who do you wanna be  
Said I don't know but I know that I'm a gonna leave  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
Alright  
  
Everybody wanna follow the crowd  
But I belong in the front singing loud  
And I'll go solo, hey  
But the fame is a hell of a temptress  
Not my wife but I guess she's a mistress, oh  
Can I let her go  
  
She can play tricks on your mind  
Have you leave your soul behind  
She's turned some niggas out  
But she can't keep her spell on me  
She can't keep back mailing me  
I'm free to leave, to be just me  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
  
So many (so many people tryna be somebody else)  
Tryna be somebody else (or whatever sells)  
I've got my own lane (I've got my own lane, I'm driving by myself)  
Hope you wish my well  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
  
I'm so gone (just you)  
All I do is walk alone (just me)  
I'm so gone (just you)  
I can make it on my own (just me)  
  
If I fall then let me fall, yea yea yea  
Oh cause I only got myself to blame  
Oh it's just me  
All I do is walk alone

Next Sunday Darling Is My Birthday
Hank Williams
----------------
Next Sunday, darling is my birthday  
A day that should be free from care  
Best wishes and congratulations  
But only sorrow fills the air  
  
While friends are singing happy birthday  
There'll be smile upon my face  
But when they're gone, the smile will vanish  
A broken heart will take it's place  
  
Another year has come and gone now  
The plans I made have gone a stray  
The day that should be filled with laughter  
Will only be another day  
  
The little house we planned together  
Is empty now without you dear  
But in my dreams you're there beside me  
So let me dream that you are here

Passion Play (When All The Slaves Are Free)
Joni Mitchell
----------------
Magdalene is trembling  
Like a washing on a line  
Trembling and gleaming  
Never before was a man so kind  
Never so redeeming  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Ecstasy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
I am up a sycamore  
Looking through the leaves  
A sinner of some position  
Who in the world can this heart healer be  
This magical physician  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Misery  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
Enter the multitudes  
The walking wounded  
They come to this diver of the heart  
Of the multitudes  
Thy kingdom come  
Thy will be done  
  
Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me  
From the middle of unrest  
They think is light is squandered  
But he sees a stray in the wilderness  
And i see how far I've wandered  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Apathy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
Enter the multitudes  
The walking wounded  
They come to this diver of the heart  
Of the multitudes  
Thy kingdom come  
Thy will be done  
  
Oh, all around the marketplace  
The buzzing of the flies  
The buzzing and the stinging  
Divinely barren  
And wickedly wise  
The killer nails are ringing  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Tragedy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)

As soon as you are able, woman I am willing  
To make the break that we are on the brink of

I Lost Me
Waylon Jennings
----------------
You tear me down a hundred times a day I've cried enough to wash the world
away  
I've tried so hard to be what you've wanted me to be  
'Til somewhere along the way I lost me  
To give and keep on giving I have learned  
  
There's no way but yours where you're concerned  
I tried till finally I lost my own identity and somewhere along the way I lost
me  
Somewhere along the way I lost the man I used to be  
A man who smiled enjoyed life loved you with all of me  
  
You'd never once considered how I felt so go ahead and live my life yourself  
I've tried so hard to be what you wanted me to be  
Somewhere along the way I lost me somewhere along the way I lost me

When we hit those islands  
There's gonna be a big hello  
Diggin' all the sunshine

Fork In The Road
Neil Young
----------------
Got a pot belly,  
It's not too big  
Gets in my way  
When I'm driving my rig  
  
Driving this country  
In a big old rig  
Things I've seen  
Mean a lot  
  
Friend has a pickup  
Drives his kid to school  
Then he takes his wife  
To beauty school  
  
Now she's doin' nails  
Gonna get a job  
Got a good teacher  
  
There's a fork in the road ahead  
I don't which way I'm gonna turn  
There's a fork in the road ahead  
  
About this year  
We salute the troops  
They're all still there  
In a fucking war  
It's no good  
Whose idea was that?  
  
I've got hope  
But you can't eat hope  
I'm not done  
Not giving up  
Not cashing in  
Too late  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me  
It's for all those creeps watching tickers on TV  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for me  
  
I'm a big rock star  
My sales have tanked  
But I still got you  
Thanks  
Download this  
Sounds like shit  
  
Keep on bloggin'  
'Til the power goes out  
Your battery's dead  
Twist and shout  
  
On the radio  
Those were the days  
Bring 'em back  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
Bailout coming but it's not for you  
  
Got my flat screen  
Got it repo'd now  
They picked it up  
Left a hole in the wall  
Last Saturday  
Missed the Raiders game  
  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
There's a bailout coming but it's not for you  
It's for all those creeps hiding what they do

Definition Of A Hotti
R. Kelly
----------------
Ah yeah  
The definition of a hotti  
R. Kelly is born into the 90's  
You know what I'm saying  
With the new shebang swing  
The definition of a hotti  
This track is going out to all the hotties out there  
You know what I'm saying  
To all the fellas that don't know what a hotti is  
I'm here to define the definition  
So check this out  
Yo here's the definition of a hotti  
A girl with Noxema skin and a V-8 body  
She can relate with your wildest dreams  
By wearing a short skirt or nice tight jeans  
She'll put you in shock and clean you up with clorox  
And then you'll say, damn, the hotti body is bare box  
Lipstick shining, earings glistening  
Yo listen to me as I kick the ballistics  
Last night, I went to a club, to a club  
To see if I could have myself some fun, yeah  
All the ladies, standing on the wall, standing on the wall  
I'm not leaving till I catch me one, till I catch me one  
Cuties, all the cuties  
So fine, so fine  
We could spend some time  
You are, you are  
The one, the one for me  
Can we have some fun?  
Hey Hotti  
Definition of a Hotti  
Hey Hotti  
Come on yeah  
Hey Hotti

Hey Hotti  
Come on yeah  
Hey Hotti  
Definition of a Hotti  
Hey Hotti  
Come on yeah  
Don't too many fellas turn her on  
But if you're kicking the funkies then her word is born  
It's best to blend in with the program, yo  
Play the same game and then say thanks ma'am  
Some hotties like to pose but they warm you up  
Just like a hot buttered roll  
Some hotties don't carry a purse  
Yeah it gets worse, check the second verse  
Last night, I took her out, I took her out  
To see what we could get into  
What we could get into  
She showed me what she was all about  
Hotti go it going on  
What's a man to do, what's a man to do  
Hey Hotti  
Definition of a Hotti  
Hey Hotti  
Come on yeah

Hey Hotti  
Come on yeah  
Hey Hotti  
Definition of a Hotti  
Hey Hotti  
Come on yeah  
Hotties play games  
Like when you got with your fame  
They sit back  
Act like they don't even know your name  
Playing it smooth until the very last minute  
Drive up in a Benzo huh  
Yeah they'll jump in it  
And satisfy you like Snickers  
You see them with their girlfriends  
You can't get with 'em  
The H O T T I is on a mission  
Fellas, I hope you're listening  
Yo yo, wait a minute man  
Yo R. Kelly man, yo  
I know what you're saying about the  
Definition of a hotti and all man  
But tell the public where all these hotties come from  
Alright bet  
I'ma break the track down right here  
Let all the homies kick it off for me  
You know what I'm saying?  
New York  
Got the hotties  
LA  
Yeah, they got the hotties  
Detroit  
They got the hotties  
Chicago  
Come on they got the hotties  
Atlanta

Do You Close Your Eyes
Rainbow
----------------
Oh na na na na  
Mystery in me is something i can't see  
But i see you very well  
You slippy, cool, nobody's fool  
But there's something inside i can't tell  
  
I know a poor man, a rich man  
I know i can talk to a king  
But nobody here is gonna tell me  
I can't find out one thing  
  
I see your glow around you  
Open your arms 'cause i'm walking to you, come straight or through  
Maybe i'm wrong but i know it won't take long to see  
  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah  
Making sweet love to me, yeah  
  
The logical friend said that i know in the end  
The things that make me smile  
To right from the start, i take the image of your heart  
And know it all the while  
  
I know a rich man, a poor man  
I know i can talk to a king, yeah  
So nobody here is gonna make me believe  
I can't find out one thing  
  
I see your glow around you  
Open your arms 'cause i'm coming, running, straight or through  
I could be wrong but i know it won't take long to see  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah  
  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes, i've gotta know  
Do you close your eyes when you making love

Let Me Into Your Life
Engelbert Humperdinck
----------------
Hurt you.  
How could anyone hurt you  
Leave you  
How could anyone want to  
You must forget him  
Turn away from your sorrow  
Let me love you  
And I'll show you tomorrow  
Just let me into your life  
Let me tear down the wall  
That is keeping you outside the heart of you  
Let me into your life  
If I can't have you all  
Then at least give me one little part of you  
Let me into your life  
Trust in me  
Let your heart learn to trust in me  
Need me  
That's the way that it must be  
Just let me love you  
Can't you see I was made to  
Let me love you  
Why are you so afraid to  
Just let me into your life  
Let me tear down the wall  
That is keeping you outside the heart of you  
Let me into your life  
If I can't have you all  
Then at least give me one little part of you  
Let me into your life  
Just let me into your life  
I will love you forever if you let me into your life

Anyone
Yazoo
----------------
Fate took a freeway to my room  
Said to much while he stayed  
And left too soon.  
Bright on an evening sea,  
He washed in with the tide  
Deep in each other's dreams  
Where all but dreams had died.  
  
Wretched in your thoughts  
Gentle hate within the love you bought.  
  
Words fade like flowers shadowed  
There beneath your wall  
Wind cries from every angle  
Dead leaves left to wait for fall.  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night.  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anyone.  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night.  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anything  
I can be anyone  
I can be anyone.

Hey Mr. DJ
Van Morrison
----------------
Listen Mr. DJ  
Won't you play me something slow  
Play me the songs  
For the lonely ones  
Play me something  
That I know  
  
Hey Mr. DJ  
I'm in a sad mood tonight  
Play me something just for me and my baby  
Won't you make everything alright  
  
I'm gonna turn it way down low  
Leave it on all night long  
Till the morning comes  
Like my lover my friend until the end  
And that special someone  
  
Hey Mr. DJ  
Play me Rainbow 66  
Cause I'm drifting like a ship out on the fog  
And I just don't know what's coming next  
  
Gonna turn it way down low  
Leave it on all night long  
Until the morning comes  
For my lover my friend until the end  
And that special someone  
  
Hey Mr. DJ  
Play me Rainbow 66  
Cause I'm drifting like a ship out on the sea  
And I just don't know what's coming next  
  
Well, Mr. DJ  
I'm in a sad mood tonight  
Play me something for me and my darling  
Want you to make everything  
Alright  
  
La, ta. ta, ta, tata

How About Me?
Judy Garland
----------------
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will make a fuss about you  
But how about me?  
  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will tell his friends about you  
But what about me?  
  
You'll find somebody new  
But what am I to do  
I'll still remember you  
When you have forgotten  
  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?  
  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?  
  
It's over  
But how about me?

Fields Of Fire
Bon Jovi
----------------
There's no-one watching over me tonight and I'm afraid to turn out the lights,  
If I close my eyes, it'll all go away and I don't wanna see it end this way.  
  
There was a time when truth and trust meant so much more to each of us  
And all the dreams that once we had have seen the sun and left us feeling bad  
  
Now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard  
I'll keep my business, but I'm a little bit afraid  
Through the years one thing hasn't changed  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass,  
Just to swin in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
That's all I ask  
  
Now feeling good is not good enough, I know they've changed but not that much  
Midnight time has left us feeling beaten up, I never was one who needs to give
enough  
I ain't a hero who gets the girl, but if I had my chance to save the world  
I won't blow it now, I guess I'll understand  
This boy becoming a man  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass,  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
That's all I ask  
  
Well, look at your hands if you hear what I said.  
Can you count on your fingers each of your real friends  
I know that I'm lucky, I know I'm right.  
Fingerst turn into fists, we're here to take on the night.  
That's right  
  
Now I'm staring at an open door, we've had a lot and I want much more  
You can keep all the money, and the streets that's painted gold  
If someone gives me back my soul  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would run through fields of fire  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I would run  
All the way back home, I would run,  
Baby come along

Heartbreaker
Free
----------------
Well my maker  
Must've been a hard heartbreaker  
I said my maker  
Must've been a hard heartbreaker  
I'll tell you why  
  
I'm breaking my own heart  
Tryin' to love a faker  
  
Like a blind man  
My little house is on fire  
Just like a blind man  
My little house is on fire  
  
I'm burning my own eyes out  
Tryin' to reach the door  
  
Well the sun is shining  
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart  
Well the sun is shining  
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart  
  
I'm wasting my whole life  
Tryin' to make a new start  
  
Make a new start  
Make a new start  
Make a new start  
Make a new start.

Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)
Louis Armstrong
----------------
Birds do it, bees do it  
Even educated fleas do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
In Spain, the best upper sets do it  
Lithuanians and let's do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
The dutch in old Amsterdam do it  
Not to mention the fins  
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins  
  
Some Argentines, without means, do it  
People say in Boston even beans do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
Romantic sponges, they say, do it  
Oysters down in oyster bay do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
Cold cape cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it  
Even lazy jellyfish, do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
Electric eels I might add do it  
Though it shocks em I know  
Why ask if shad do it, waiter bring me  
"shad roe"  
  
In shallow shoals english soles do it  
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
In old Japan, all the Japs do it  
Up in Lapland little laps do it  
Let's do it, let's fall in love  
  
The chimpanzees in the zoos do it  
Some courageous kangaroos do it  
Let's do it, let's  
Fall in love  
  
I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it  
Even eagles as they fly do it  
Let's do it, let's fall  
In love  
  
Electric eels I might add do it  
Though it shocks em I know  
Why ask if shad do it, garcon de  
"shad roe"  
  
The world admits bears in pits do it  
Even pekingeses at the Ritz do it  
Let's do it, let's  
Fall in love  
  
The royal set sans regret did it  
And they considered it fun  
Marie Antoinette did it  
With or without napoleon

Carry My Soul
Kelly Family
----------------
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah he, ho my name is Jimmy beep beereep beeb beeb  
Whatever you want to call me  
You know like the birds fly in the air  
That's how I want to be  
Free, free, free  
I've been trying all my life to break free  
It's like a big bad fight that never ends  
You know what I'm saying  
First I was a soldier  
Then I was a rebel  
Then a runaway, and I've been running ever since  
But it's like everything is in my way,  
Everything, even my head, my body  
[sung]  
A drop in the sea caused a flood  
Quenching man's drought  
You did it to me, to my thirsty heart  
With your tender touch  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah like a drop in the sea, that's how I feel sometimes  
Like I'm stuck in the traffic or something  
But I wasn't gonna let that be  
I made a plan  
I worked hard, I had a tv, I had a car, I had a house  
I was a man with a job, you know  
You know I had all those things  
But then I broke down one day  
And I lost it all  
I came rolling down that mountain  
[sung]  
A pencil in the hands of almighty love  
Where the ink won't dry  
Is writing the names of poor men dying  
In his angel's arms  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah I lost it all, and like magic I was free  
When no one spoke to me  
When no one cared for me  
That's the day I started singing this song  
And this is how it goes:  
[sung]  
Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul  
Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul  
Carry my soul  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
[spoken]  
Yeah! That's the song of the free  
I don't want to fight no more  
I feel we where made for something big  
Just let the wind blow  
[sung]  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
You did it to me  
My thirsty hearth  
[spoken]  
Yeah, just let the wind blow  
[sung]  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
Blessed are the poor  
Oh Almighty Love

I Wanna Know Why
Aerosmith
----------------
Kickin' down the road  
Feelin' mighty slowed  
With the likes of you  
Gettin' mighty spaced  
Never had a taste  
Of what you're goin' through  
I can't bitch  
Went from rags to riches  
Then to ragtime screamin' the blues  
I want to know why  
Everybody's good intention  
Try to make a fool out of me  
I want to know why  
Everybody's good intention  
Gotta make a fool  
Gotta make a fool  
Try to make a fool out of me  
Swing low  
Sweet cherry o  
When a strange love showed me the way  
Ya see more  
Can't keep a score  
When the whore's comin' on for the play  
E. Poe  
Eatin' crow  
Wonder if he knowed that the raven was mad  
Time passed  
And words lost the last  
Of the best thing he ever had  
Oh play rough  
Can't get enough  
So they try to make a fool out of me, lordy  
Ain't foolin' me  
Ya ain't ghoulin' me  
Ain't foolin' me  
Ya ain't ghoulin' me

It's All Over Now
Faces
----------------
Baby used to stay out all night long  
She made me cry  
You know she done me wrong  
She held my eyes open and that's no lie  
  
Tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Yes it is  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Listen  
She used to run around with every single man in town  
Spent all my money playing her fast game  
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried  
  
But the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Ain't no lie  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Well I used to wake the morning get my breakfast in bed  
When I got worried she'd ease my aching head  
But now she's here and there with every single man in town  
But the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Yes it is  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
But then I used to love her but it's all  
But then I used to love her but you know  
But you know it's all over now  
But then I used to love her but you know it's all over now

Black Bird Fly
John Denver
----------------
Packed up all my cares and woes  
Here I go soft and low  
Bye, bye, black bird singing in the dead of night.  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Black bird sing in the dead of night  
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see  
All your life, your were only waiting for this moment to be free  
Black bird fly, Black bird fly  
Into the light of the black dark night  
  
Black bird fly, black bird fly  
Into the light of the dark black  
  
Black bird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arrive  
  
Make my bed, and light the light I'll be home late tonight  
Black bird, bye, bye

Somewhere Someone's Falling In Love
John Prine
----------------
Well, I got time on my hands and I got you on my mind  
And the moon and the stars up above  
There's a warm summer breeze  
Blowing down through the trees  
And somewhere someone's falling in love  
Well, if this world where we live is the only one we have  
Then there's only one thing I'm thinking of  
Let's go for that ride - keep our eyes open wide  
Cause somewhere someone's falling in love  
  
Chorus:  
You may be looking for someone  
Someone may be looking for you  
Someday you'll awaken and open your eyes  
And love will be looking at you  
  
So don't get down on yourself.  
No and don't lose your faith  
Believe these words that I'm singing of  
For as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someone's falling in love  
  
[Repeat Chorus:]  
So don't get down on yourself.  
No, and don't lose your faith  
Believe these words that I'm singing of  
For as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someone's falling in love  
Yeah, for as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someone's falling  
Somewhere someone's falling  
Somewhere someone's falling in love

Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,

Well, somewhere there's a rainbow for me,

Of standing in this light  
Can't you hear me cry.

Easy To Love You
Grateful Dead
----------------
Good, good morning so good to see you  
Weren't just a dream of mine  
Real as a raven, real as thunder  
Real as the sun shinin'  
But still so very undefined  
Can't imagine what's  
Behind those sleepy eyes  
Little stranger, don't try to hide now  
You look so young when you're afraid  
There is no danger but from the Devil  
He may want you but I'm in His way  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you  
And come the moon rise, when the dew falls  
Don't be the sun that fades away  
Don't leave me darkness  
She is no lover, she hides the day  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you  
You don't know how easy it is  
You don't know how easy it is to love you

Something About December
Christina Perri
----------------
Lights around the tree  
Mama's whistling  
Takes me back again  
There's something bout' December  
  
We're hanging mistletoe  
And hoping that it snows  
I close my eyes and then  
I can still remember  
How to get back, home  
  
Let all your memories  
Hold you close  
No matter where you are  
You're not alone  
Because the ones you love  
Are never far  
If Christmas is in your heart  
  
Who really needs a gift  
When love is meant to give  
I can still recall  
Carry with me always  
Every Christmas dream  
They live in you and me  
  
Let all your memories  
Hold you close  
No matter where you are  
You're not alone  
Because the ones you love  
Are never far  
If Christmas is in your heart  
  
Lights around the tree  
Mama's whistling  
Takes me back again  
There's something bout' December  
  
Let all your memories  
Hold you close  
No matter where you are  
You're not alone  
Because the ones you love  
Are never far  
If Christmas is in your heart

I'm Gonna Love You
Kiss
----------------
Don't let me find you  
Sleepin' with another man  
Say you're gonna be true  
And stay and love me like you can  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
Honey, won't you tell me  
You don't want nobody else  
Don't you tear my heart out  
And lay it on your shelf  
  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
And I'm gonna love you (gonna love you)  
Rain or come shine (rain or come shine)  
You know you're gonna find me (gonna find me)  
Around you all the time (time)  
  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine

Astral Body
Alphaville
----------------
Into this world we're thrown  
A lifeform without a home  
Clowns in a circus called the material world  
Gods without immortality, nothing to lose  
Nothing to gain, nothing to keep  
Shepherds of dreams, we are what we are  
  
Lovers, losers, loners, leapers, liars  
The meaning of life and I want to touch  
Your astral body !!!  
We are what we are  
Oh, we're so full of light, don't let it die  
And I want to touch your astral body !!!  
  
And if I put pennies on your eyes or pyramids  
On your grave, mysteries mountain high  
The day I have to go  
But before I leave, I just want to feel love !!!  
I want to touch somebody else than me  
  
We are what we are...

Families
Neil Young
----------------
When you try to bring our spirit home  
Won't you celebrate our lives  
In a way that's right for our children  
And families  
  
When you write your songs about us  
Won't you try to do us justice  
Because we want to be just like you  
And your families  
  
I see a light ahead  
There's a chill wind blowin' in my head  
I wish that I was home instead  
With my family  
  
There's a universe between us now  
But I want to reach out and tell you  
How much you mean to me  
And my family  
  
I'm goin' back to the USA  
I just got my ticket today  
I can't wait to see you again  
In the USA.

Let It Snow
America
----------------
Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow  
Oh, fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Angels Among Us
Alabama
----------------
I was walkin'home from school  
On a cold winter day,  
Took a short cut through the woods  
And I lost my way.  
It was gettin' late, and I was scared and alone.  
Then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home.  
Mama couldn't see him,  
But he was standing there,  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayer.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I believe there are Angels Among Us,  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hours  
To show us how to live  
To teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times  
And had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone  
To come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger  
To lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend  
Just to say I understand  
Now ain't it kind of funny  
At the dark end of the road  
Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They wear so many faces,  
Show up in the strangest places  
And grace us with their mercies in our time of need.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To guide us with a light of love

Love Among The Cannibals
Starship
----------------
Love among the cannibals, love among the cannibals  
Love among the cannibals  
  
I heard you sing about love, but that was a long time ago  
I was one of the ones who believed your lies, now your true colors show  
So we stand upon the grave of the promises you made  
With nowhere left to hide and no more alibis  
  
Dark teeth, bite deep, better not turn your back  
No show, move slow, remember to cover your tracks, get back!  
  
Love among the cannibals (Eat my heart out), two-faced animals  
Love among the cannibals (I want to stand and shout) two-faced animals  
  
I move alone in the dark, feelin' too weak to fight  
Cause I know the dream is about to die, in the dim and dusty light  
Where the river used to roll a caravan of souls  
Move naked and alone, shining like a bone  
  
Night falls, skin crawls, darkness everywhere  
Too much bad blood, nobody seems to care, beware!  
  
Love among the cannibals (Eat my heart out), two-faced animals  
Love (Oh) among the cannibals  
Love among the cannibals (Love), two-faced animals  
Love (Love) among the cannibals, two-faced animals.

Lost And Found
Judas Priest
----------------
I always used to be afraid  
That I was going to lose my way  
I never used to walk in line but stray  
  
I never thought I'd see it through  
That I could deal with losing you  
But suddenly I see the light of day  
  
Leading me in  
From out of the night  
Staying on course I'm still alive  
I had to confess I never thought I would ever survive  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now I'm found  
  
Focused on my altered state  
I would just disorientate  
Suffering alone amongst the crowd  
  
Drifting on a sea of doubt  
And no one ever heard me shout  
That I was lost and couldn't find my way  
  
No one at hand  
Having no plan  
Stumbled through a barren land  
  
After so long  
Of going wrong  
I found the road  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now I'm found  
  
I was lost and found  
I had hit the ground  
I was lost but now I found  
  
That I don't need no one  
To survive  
You've got to believe alone  
You'll rise  
  
Starting to run  
Shedding the load  
Now I can see I'm close to home  
  
After so long  
Of going wrong  
I found the road  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now I'm found

Drawing Me Closer
Point Of Grace
----------------
I'd be lost here inside myself  
I'd be nothing without You  
If Your ways didn't pull me in  
Like they do  
  
(Chorus)  
It's the hope I know, the grace you show  
That drawing me closer, drawing me closer  
It's the peace I feel, it's your love so real  
That's drawing me closer  
  
And my heart beats with pure amazement  
Every time I fell the tender touch of your love  
Drawing me closer  
Tell me how when You hold me near  
I can feel so free  
Where would I be if not for You  
Moving me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Your love  
I can hear your voice it's calling me  
To the shelter of Your arms  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
It's the hope I know, the grace You show  
That's drawing me closer  
It's the peace I feel, it's Your love so real  
That's drawing me closer  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Your love  
Closer, Closer  
Hey, hey now drawing me closer  
Hey, hey now  
Everybody come and see  
Hey, hey now yeah  
Drawing me closer  
Hey, hey now...

I Could Have Danced All Night
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night  
And still have begged for more  
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things  
I've never done before  
  
I'll never know what made it so exciting  
Why all at once my heart took flight  
I only know when he began to dance with me  
I could have danced, danced, danced all night  
  
I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night  
And still have begged for more, more, more  
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things  
I've never done before  
  
I'll never know what made it so, so exciting  
Why all at once my heart took flight  
I only know when he began to dance with me  
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

Just This One Time
Cher
----------------
JUST THIS ONE TIME  
WRITER JIMMY WEBB  
  
I've got to try just one more time  
To help you believe in me  
Oh, look into my eyes, check my face  
For lies and you might see  
My life's never been everything  
I want it to be, but with you  
I could change this bad luck  
With you I could hold my head up  
And loving you  
  
Just this one time  
I need someone to believe in me  
Breathe it with me  
Get beneath it with me, now  
Sweet darlin', just this one time  
  
I've got to say the perfect thing  
Oh, I can't make mistakes now  
Oh, I've got to read your signs  
I've gotta sing those magic lines  
You've got to hear  
  
I know I've given you every reason  
In this whole round world to fear me now  
But my love's a raging river  
And you've wrapped it in your hand  
Oh darlin'  
  
Just this one time I need someone  
To believe in me, believe in me  
Just this one time I need someone  
To leave it with me, breathe it with me  
Get beneath it with me now sweet daddy  
Just this one time  
  
Just this one time  
I really need somebody  
(repeat)

My Little Lovely
Moody Blues
----------------
Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely.  
  
Always believe and never doubt  
That wizards cast their spells about  
There's such a lot you won't lose count  
If you look closely.  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
So choose one wisely.  
  
Not all angels can grow wings  
They seem to soar by other means  
You can fly although it seems  
A little slowly.  
  
Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely.  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
My little lovely.

Bluebird Cafe
John Waite
----------------
Her I.D, says she's 21  
But she's just 17  
Her apron says Mary  
But her real name is Jean  
  
She's working cleaning tables off  
At the local Dairy Queen  
And she's the real thing  
Yeah  
  
Young hearts can fly restless and wild  
Though it's a thousand days away  
She's got the will and she'll find a way  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
She's got her boyfriends name  
Carved in the back of her guitar  
It's a beat up old Epiphone  
  
With painted on stars  
She wears her brother's 501's  
And keeps her tips in a jar  
By a picture of Patsy Cline  
  
She's fine  
Young hearts can fly restless and wild  
Though she'll get out of this town someday  
She's got the will and she'll find a way  
  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
Yeah  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
She's into country body and soul  
  
But nobody's future is written in stone  
And to get what she wants  
She's gonna have to walk alone  
And she will  
  
All the way to Nashville  
To Nashville  
Yeah yeah  
She comes out of work some nights  
  
Stops and stares down the road  
Through the heat and the crickets  
And the telegraph poles  
Out in the darkness  
  
Hank's Blue Highway calls  
And she just stops and smiles  
Yeah  
Young hearts can fly restless and wild  
  
Though it's a thousand days away  
She's got the will and she'll find a way yeah  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
Yeah  
  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
She's got the will and she'll find a way  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe

If You Were There
Isley Brothers
----------------
You're the one that makes my day a dream come true  
Yet and still you wander if I think of you  
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not round  
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound  
  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me no  
'Cause it's by your side girl that I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say  
What you don't know is with you I can never act that way  
  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
I care for you baby  
I swear that I care  
I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Have faith in me  
I care for you baby

Modern Girl
Meat Loaf
----------------
Once a beautiful Miss America married Mr. Right  
Had a little baby girl, born on a stormy night  
But that was once upon a time, now it's a brand new world  
  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Somewhere just between the past and somethin' dawnin' new  
  
There's a break in the chain, a skip in the clock  
Girl that's where I'm gonna find you  
Between the boy I was before and what I'm gonna be  
There's a clash on the border, a flame in the sky  
Girl that's where you're gonna find me  
  
Can't you hear the planet groanin' like a broken down machine  
Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens  
But you and I stand innocent, baby it's a brand new world  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl)  
  
We're the son and the daughter on a new freeway  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)  
Laughin' while the road maps blow away  
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)  
We're the son and the daughter and we ain't afraid  
  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)  
Won't be makin' the mistakes our fathers made  
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future) oh, gimme the future with a modern girl  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future) oh, gimme the future with a modern girl

No Fortune
America
----------------
We were dancin' in the middle  
We could hardly hold our heads up  
I think we had too much to drink  
I remember wondering what they'd think  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
We were thinkin' 'bout the future  
We were trying not to laugh  
Then you made me cry instead  
I remember wishing I was dead  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Well I'm coming home lady  
I'm your homecoming man  
Trying hard to stand the rain  
Gettin' back on my feet again  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these

Take Care
Drake
----------------
Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
I've asked about you and they've told me things  
But my mind didn't change  
I still the feel the same  
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know  
We know, they don't get you like I will  
My only wish is I die real  
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal  
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still  
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case  
Big girls all get a little taste  
Pushing me away so I give her space  
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break  
I'll be there for you, I will care for you  
I keep thanking you, just don't know  
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that  
On your face girl, it just don't show  
When you're ready, just say you're ready  
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy  
And the parties over, just don't forget me  
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow  
You won't ever have to worry,  
You won't ever have to hide  
And you seen all my mistakes  
So look me in my eyes  
  
Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
It's my birthday, I get high if I want to  
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to  
Cause you don't say you love me  
To your friends when they ask you  
Even though we both know that you do (you do)  
One time, been in love one time  
You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you're following your heart  
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know  
We know,  
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you  
Instead they say  
  
Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost

Little Man You've Had A Busy Day
Perry Como
----------------
Little man you're cryin', I know why you're blue  
Someone took your kiddy-car away  
Better go to sleep now  
Little man you've had a busy day...  
  
Johnny won your marbles, tell you what we'll do  
Dad will get you new ones right away  
Better go to sleep now  
Little man you've had a busy day...  
  
You've been playin' soldier, the battle has been won  
The enemy is out of sight  
Come along there soldier, put away your gun  
The war is over for tonight...  
  
Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through  
Can't you hear the bugle softly say?  
Time you should be dreamin'  
Little man you've had a busy day...  
  
Time you should be dreamin'  
Little man you've had a busy day...

Honestly
Zwan
----------------
I believe  
I believe  
I believe  
I believe the love you talk about with me  
Is it true, do I care  
Honestly, you can try to wipe the memories aside  
But it's you that you erase  
  
Cause there's no place that I could be without you  
It's too far to discard the life I once knew  
Honestly, all the weather storms are bringing  
Are just a picture of my dreams  
Cause when I think of you as mine  
And allow myself with time  
To lead into the life we want  
I feel loved, honestly  
I feel loved, this honestly  
  
I believe you mean the best that life can bring  
I believe in it all  
Honestly, you can try  
Your heart is just as long as mine  
Is it ours to let go  
  
Cause there's no place that I could be without you  
It's too dark to discard the life I once knew  
Honestly, a single wrong is not enough  
To cover up the pain in us  
Cause when I think of you as mine  
And allow myself with time  
To lead into the life we want  
I feel loved, honestly  
I'll make a joke so you must laugh  
I'll break your heart so you must ask  
Is this the way to get us back  
I don't know, honestly  
I don't know, this honestly  
  
There's no place that I could be without you  
Honestly  
  
There's no place that I could be without you  
There's no place that I could gleam without you  
There's no place that I could dream without you  
There's no place that I could be without you  
Honestly

The River
Imagine Dragons
----------------
In the latest midnight hour  
When the world has gone to sleep  
You gotta get up  
When doubts begin to rise  
And the world is at your feet  
You gotta get up  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself  
  
I'm not a selfless man  
I'm not a man of wealth  
If I had all the world,  
Probably give it to myself  
But the trees begin to walk  
And the ground begins to talk  
And myself  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself  
  
Hold my place  
Don't you give up on me  
Hold on, hold on  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself

Everlasting Love
Vanessa Williams
----------------
When I feel you dreaming  
I think of sunsets  
How high my high gets  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna give to you an everlasting love  
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love  
All you need is an everlasting love  
All you want is a mystifying love  
  
Sun breezes, moonlight teases  
  
Friendly invasion  
Late night persuasion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Each time you pass me by  
You saw me fade away  
I'll give you more each day

I've Got A Crush On You
Linda Ronstadt
----------------
How glad the many millions  
Of toms and dicks and Williams  
Would be to capture me  
But you had such persistence  
You wore down my resistance  
I fell and it was swell  
  
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo  
How I won you I will never, never know  
It's not that you're attractive  
But, oh my heart grew active  
When you came into view  
  
I've got a crush on you, sweetie-pie  
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion  
That I could fall with so much emotion  
Could you coo!  
Could you care?  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cuz I've got a crush, my baby on you  
  
Could you coo!  
Could you care?  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cuz I have got a crush, my baby on you

Bottles To The Ground
NOFX
----------------
You know it when it's over  
Door are closing feel the sober staring at you  
You know you better take one more good look  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
Smashing of the glass what a super sonic sound  
You gotta pull the plug when it's time to die  
Whoa whoa whoa, bottles to the ground  
  
There's a suitcase on the side walk  
There's some records in a milk crate  
She'll be staying  
You'll be throwing whiskey over one lip  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
Smashing of the glass a perfect imperfect sound  
You gotta pay the piper when the rats are gone  
Whoa whoa whoa, bottles to the ground  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground

Forgetting You
Dean Martin
----------------
When they tell you I'm dating  
With somebody new  
Don't you know that I'm playing a part  
Forgetting you  
I still want you to want me  
Though you said we're through  
Can't you see that I don't want to start  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I don't want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Don't you know that it's breaking my heart  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I don't want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Don't you know that it's busting my heart  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you

Thinking About You
Whitney Houston
----------------
Huh, huh ooh I'm just a fool for you  
Huh huh huh huh  
I can't get you off my mind  
No matter what I do  
I'm wishing you were here with me  
Makes no difference (when it is)  
I only think of you  
And I'm living out my fantasy  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)  
It's still the same  
Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep thinking about you baby  
Oh so tell me what ya gonna do  
Got me thinking about you  
All I want to do  
  
Like a river of wine  
Intoxicate my mind  
I'm thinking about you  
That's what I want to do  
Pick me up, let's go down  
I'm thinking about it too (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
I'm thinking about you  
Got me thinking about you  
I'm thinking about it too  
  
Make believing is a game  
That's not for me to play  
Don't you need me just like I need you  
There's no reason  
Just my heart that makes me feel this way  
And I hope you feel the same way too  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)  
It's still the same  
Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It might be pouring rain  
Like a fool insane  
I'm just a lovesick fool  
I got this thing for you (I'm just a I'm just a lovesick fool)  
Oh just a fool for you!

Foo Fighters
----------------
There's a place I'd love to go,  
Strangers they can meet there,  
Dream about the day I lernt to fly.  
I'm afraid of airaplains,  
Even though I like their wings,  
Fears to be a person in the sky.  
  
It's alright.  
And it's good this time.  
  
I look out and on the ground,  
Really don't believe it,  
Gravity can pull me from this hight.  
One day we'll come crashing down,  
What will I do,  
Never had a chance to say goodbye.  
Close my eyes and hope that it's a real smooth flight  
this time.  
Close my eyes and hope that it's a real smooth flight,  
And it's good this time.  
I looked down out on the ground,  
I looked down out on the ground,  
I looked down out on the ground,  
I look out we're going down.

Dark Hollow
Grateful Dead

I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine  
Then to be at home alone and knowing' that you're gone  
Would cause me to lose my mind  
  
Well blow your whistle freight train carry me far on down the track  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today  
I'm goin', but I ain't comin' back  
  
I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine  
Then to be in some big city, in a small room, with you upon my mind

Devil In The Bottle
Hank Williams Jr.

I Come Home Late At Night  
With My Boots In My Hand  
Stumble In The Back Door  
Being Quite As I Can  
And I Know She's There In Bed  
Cold And All Alone  
And She's Cryin'  
Because I'm Breaking Up Our Home  
  
[Chorus:]  
And She Knows  
The Hell I'm Going Through  
In This World  
Inside My Head  
There's A Devil  
In The Bottle  
And He Want's  
To See Me Dead  
I Fall Into Her Arms  
And She Helps Me With My Clothes  
I Guess She Stays On With Me  
Because She Really Knows  
That I'm Tryin' Lord  
To Find My Freedom  
By Escaping To The Only  
Freedom I've Ever Known  
  
Repeat [Chorus:]  
  
Yes,There's A Devil  
In The Bottle  
And He Want's  
To See Me Dead  
And It's Killing Her  
Watching Me Die This Way

Bells Ring
Mazzy Star
----------------
Bells ring into the night  
Sounds like a mystery sonnet at night  
Hold your throat and I'll come together  
And see the light that goes away  
Leave my heart down by the water  
It sleeps inside my soul  
It isn't true about your father  
Just hold me down by the water  
This ? black as the moonlight  
Look up to see your weakness in the sky  
Nobody's out to buy your story  
Nobody wants to know your reason why  
Hold your hands and throw the water  
In front of me to know how I feel  
Don't put it all into your hero  
You're gone, feeling  
You're gone, feeling  
You're gone, feeling  
Don't want to say that I'm through with it  
Just want to be like I am inside  
Right by your side

Final Goodbye
Usher
----------------
It's time to say goodbye  
It's over now  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Is there a reason why our love could not last  
I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty  
Lady  
I thought we had a master plan  
But it takes a stronger man to walk away  
Than to watch our love fade away  
  
I often wonder how and why  
I did not cheat I did not lie  
I hope you know how hard I tried  
But it's over for now  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't believe how suddenly things change  
Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were  
Heartaches  
And pain  
Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out  
But in my heart I knew  
I still had my doubts  
  
I thought we made a symphony  
It's over now no more harmony  
I prayed so hard for love to fly (oh yeah)  
It's time to say goodbye  
Ooh bye bye bye bye bye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sorry I gotta leave  
Baby I'm beggin' please  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Bye bye bye bye  
  
[Chorus]

A Living Prayer
Alison Krauss
----------------
In this world I walk alone with no place to call my home  
But there's One who holds my hand  
The rugged road through barren lands  
The way is dark, the road is steep  
But He's become my eyes to see  
The strength to climb, my griefs to bear  
This Savior lives inside me there  
  
In Your love I find release  
A haven from my unbelief  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee  
  
In these trials of life I find  
Another Voice inside my mind  
He comforts me and bids me live  
Inside the love the Father gives  
  
In your love I find release  
A haven from my unbelief  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee

I Remember Yesterday
Donna Summer
----------------
I remember that first night we met,  
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets,  
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet,  
You and me and this fantasy,  
Oh I remember our first night.  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn.  
From the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part,  
Oh I remember that first night.  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.  
  
I saw your love light through the candle's glow,  
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go,  
And when the night was over, we both looked around the room,  
Remember darling, chairs on the table, and only me and you  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn,  
And from the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part.  
I remember that first night  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.

Beside You
Iggy Pop

I been hungry way down in my heart  
Waiting for a reason  
I been hungry like a lot of guys  
I want to be beside you  
Lonely people pass me in the street  
Waiting for a reason  
  
Beside you  
Grey is turning to blue

Beside you  
Everything is new  
You wake up love in me  
I been hungry way down where it hurts  
Waiting for a reason  
I been hungry like a lot of guys

Nocturn
Kate Bush
----------------
[Chorus:]  
Sweet dreams  
  
On this Midsummer might  
Everyone is sleeping  
We go driving into the moonlight  
  
Could be in a dream  
Our clothes are on the beach  
These prints of our feet  
Lead right up to the sea  
No one, no one is here  
No one, no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
We tire of the city  
We tire of it all  
We long for just that something more  
  
Could be in a dream  
Our clothes are on the beach  
These prints of our feet  
Lead right up to the sea  
No one, no one is here  
No one, no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
The stars are caught in our hair  
The stars are on our fingers  
A veil of diamond dust  
Just reach up and touch it  
The sky's above our heads  
The sea's around our legs  
In milky, silky water  
We swim further and further  
We dive down  
We dive down  
  
A diamond night, a diamond sea  
And a diamond sky  
  
We dive deeper and deeper  
We dive deeper and deeper  
Could be we are here  
Could be we are in a dream  
It came up on the horizon  
Rising and rising  
In a sea of honey, a sky of honey  
A sea of honey, a sky of honey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at the light, all the time it's a changing  
Look at the light, climbing up the aerial  
Bright, white coming alive jumping off of the aerial  
All the time it's a changing, like now  
All the time it's a changing, like then again  
All the time it's a changing  
And all the dreamers are waking.

It's Raining On Prom Night
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
I was deprived of a young girl's dream  
By the cruel force of nature from the blue  
Instead of a night full of romance supreme  
All I got was a runny nose and Asiatic flu  
  
It's raining on prom night  
My hair is a mess  
It's running all over  
My taffeta dress  
  
It's wiltin' the quiltin'  
In my maiden-form  
And mascara flows  
Right down my nose  
Because of the storm  
  
I don't even have  
My corsage, oh gee  
It fell down the sewer  
With my sister's I.D  
  
Yes, it's raining on prom night  
Oh my darling, what can I do?  
I miss you  
It's raining rain from the skies  
And it's raining real tears from my eyes over you  
  
Oh, dear God, make him feel  
The same way I do right now  
Make him want to see me again  
  
Oh, what can I do?  
It's raining rain from the skies  
It's raining tears from my eyes over you  
Raining, oh, tears from my eyes over you  
  
Raining, oh, raining on prom night  
Oh, raining, oh, tears from my eyes over you  
Raining

Spiderman, Spiderman  
  
Does whatever a spider  
Spins a web any size  
Catches theives just like flys  
  
Look out!  
Here comes a spiderman  
  
Is he strong?  
Listen good  
Hes got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread  
Take a look overhead  
Hear that?  
There goes a spiderman  
  
In the chill of night  
At scene of the crime  
Like a streak of light,  
He arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, spiderman  
Friendly neighborhood spiderman  
Fame and fortune is ingored  
Action is his reward  
  
Look out  
There goes a spiderman  
  
In the chill of night  
At scene of the crime  
Like a streak of light,  
He arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, spiderman  
Friendly neighborhood spiderman  
Wealth and fame is ingored  
Action is his reward  
  
To him... Life is a great big??  
Where ever there's a crime  
Youll find the spiderman!

[Intro]  
Oh right, oh  
Oh why  
Na-da-da-da  
  
[Hook]  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I don't know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
I've been unfaithful  
I don't know why you call on me  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my canvas  
I'mma paint it how I want it baby, oh I  
This is my canvas  
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga  
Fuck you cause there  
There is no right or wrong, only a song  
I like to write alone, be in my zone  
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home  
But the only thing like home I've ever known  
Until they snatched it from my mama  
And foreclosed her on the loan  
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone  
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome  
Had no clue what you was goin' through  
How could you be so strong?  
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish  
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way  
Because she loves me like you do  
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you  
And I need to treat you better  
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together  
(I love you mama)  
  
[Hook]  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I don't know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
I've been unfaithful  
I don't know why you call on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me  
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it  
  
[Verse 2]  
Another day another rhyme ho  
Another day another time zone  
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right  
I got two bitches playin' on my trombone  
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me  
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me  
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy  
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  
Nigga please  
Best friends really make great for enemies  
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these  
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga  
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga  
Uh, couldn't resist  
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed  
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon  
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch  
Like thanks for the view  
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist  
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget  
Cole is your phone on zero percent  
Going off, now niggas showin' off  
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft  
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing  
Gettin' head like a coin toss  
Too easy  
  
[Hook]  
I keep my head high  
I got my wings to carry me  
I don't know freedom  
I want my dreams to rescue me  
I keep my faith strong  
I ask the Lord to follow me  
I've been unfaithful  
I don't know why you call on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me  
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

To Whom It May Concern
Natalie Cole
----------------
To whom it may concern  
You found another love I know  
To whom it may concern  
My heart won't ever let you go  
You tore my heart apart  
When you found somebody new  
But you found out that your heart could be broken too  
So to whom it may concern  
You've learned that heartache has no pride  
  
Pretending unconcerned won't stop those tears you try to hide  
And when you're all alone with just a memory  
That's when I'll bet you'll learn the one who's most concerned is me  
And when you're all alone with just a memory  
  
That's when I'll bet you'll learn the one who's most concerned is me

Watch Us Fall
Omd
----------------
Here we come again  
Like a message in the pouring rain  
And every now and then  
I still call your name  
  
Like partners in crime  
Every once in a while  
The the fishes at sea  
It's just the life we lead  
  
We're going up  
We're going down again  
  
We're going up  
We're going down again  
  
Watch us fall  
  
And time stood still  
In a distant town  
I know you  
I know you much too well  
Last year you said  
It's time to settle down  
Last time I saw you  
You were still running around  
  
Going up  
Going down again  
  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall  
  
Remember when you said  
It's time to settle down  
Well last time I saw you  
You were still running around  
  
Going up  
Going down again  
We're going up  
We're coming down again  
  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall

Has no bones  
To hurt your throat  
Good and sweet  
Nice to eat

Just repeat  
  
I'll set myself on fire

I'll set myself on fire  
Oh strike my hand  
On a stone Joan  
God knows this is yuk  
Do it all in unison  
Ha ha ha  
Ho ho ho  
  
We have the pool  
Ah - no that's cruel  
Why do you take me for  
A fool?  
Try the rails  
It's just not me  
No no no  
No - Siree

Happy Man
Iggy Pop
----------------
I'm her only man  
And she's my only romance  
I'm her only man  
And she's my only romance  
  
Singing oh, oh, oh  
I'm a happy man  
Singing oh, oh, oh  
  
I can make her scream  
'Cause she's my only machine  
I'm her confidant  
And she's my only cream  
  
Singing oh, oh, oh

Because we are lovers  
And she's my girl  
  
I'm singing oh, oh  
I'm in a happy world

Too Beautiful For Words
Christina Aguilera
----------------
When I try to describe  
How I feel when you hold me  
I get butterflies  
I hear lullabies  
It's hard to explain  
  
Like the scent of a rose  
Or the sound of the rain  
Is too precious and too wonderful  
To give it a name  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
It's on the tip of my tongue  
But my lips are still sealed  
Only violins  
And then innocence  
Can show you how I feel  
  
And I hear them again  
At the end of the day  
I'm all teary eyed  
When we kissed goodbye  
There's nothing I can say  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words, oh  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Must be a million times  
I tried to express this love of mine  
When it goes this deep  
When it tastes this sweet  
It's not easy to define, ohh  
  
Too beautiful for words (too beautiful)  
A symphony inside me (a symphony inside of me)  
Too beautiful for words (for words)  
I can not take them lightly  
  
Too beautiful for words (too beautiful ohh)  
A symphony inside me (a symphony, oh)  
Too beautiful for words (ohh, too beautiful baby)  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Ohh yeah, yeah, oooh...

Broken Man's Lament
Emmylou Harris
----------------
I was once a broken man  
I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule  
Now I live my life in silence  
Tho' I'm not quite in a shell  
Drink and listen to that song  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic  
So I send myself to school  
They smoothed off my rough edges  
In my hands they put new tools  
The instructor once he told me  
I could work on any line  
I could tend and make any diesel sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline  
  
Well I met my wife to be  
Through my mother's best friend's son  
She had been a bar room singer  
She was as good as anyone  
But I ask her to stop singing  
And the girl she did not flinch  
Next day she went and bought that man  
A brand new crescent wrench, ohh  
A brand new crescent wrench  
  
We had three fine children  
As eight years went on by  
And earned a silver visor  
The knuckles stayed bone dry  
But after supper I kept hearin' her  
By the kitchen radio  
Singing sweet but desperate harmony  
A little bit to low, ohhh  
A little bit to low  
  
She left three months later  
I'd just come home for lunch  
Note said "easy come, hard go"  
I still love you so much  
She said I don't know if I'll be there  
Or if you'll want me when I come  
But if and when that Abbott steer  
You better  
Let my sweet dream run, ohhh  
Let my sweet dream run  
  
Ohhhh...ohhh...ohhh...ohhh  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic  
So I send myself to school  
They smoothed off my rough edges  
In my hands they put new tools  
The instructor once he told me  
I could work on any line  
But now the diesels aren't the only thing that sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline  
  
I was once a broken man  
I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule  
Now I live my life in silence  
Tho' I'm not quite in a shell  
Drink and listen to that song  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale

Cold Cold Heart
Willie Nelson
----------------
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
  
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry  
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try  
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart  
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory  
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Here Comes President Kill Again
XTC

Here comes President Kill again,  
Surrounded by all of his killing men.  
Telling us who, why, where and when,  
President Kill wants killing again.  
  
Hooray, ring out the bells,  
King Conscience is dead.  
Hooray, now back in your cells,  
We've President Kill instead.

Broadcasting from his killing den.  
Dressed in pounds and dollars and yen,

Queen Caring is dead.  
Hooray, we'll stack body bags,  
For President Kill instead.

Here comes President Kill again,  
From pure White House to Number 10.  
Taking lives with a smoking pen,  
President Kill wants killing again.  
  
Hooray, everything's great,  
Now President Kill is dead.  
Hooray, I'll bet you can't wait,  
To vote for President Kill instead...

More Than That Tomorrow
Jim Croce
----------------
Hey love don't be afraid to stay until tomorrow  
Lover's dawn is waiting just this side of day  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
I'll love you more than that tomorrow  
  
Hey love don't be afraid to hear the songs of morning  
Birds will sing them as they're calling up the day  
If I sang to you yesterday  
I'll sing more than that tomorrow  
  
If it should happen that you come to me  
In the night we share our hearts  
Whatever it is that you done to me  
Between you and me, can't be undone...  
  
If I should understand just why I need you by me  
Then I would know the reasons for the songs of morning  
'Cause if I wanted you yesterday  
And if in the night we shared our hearts  
Whatever it is that you done to me  
Between you and me, can't be undone...  
  
Hey love don't be afraid to stay until tomorrow  
Lover's dawn is waiting just this side of day  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
I'll love you more than that tomorrow  
  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
I'll love you more than that tomorrow

Buck Dich (English)
Rammstein
----------------
Bend over, I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I don't care about your face  
Bend over  
  
A two-legged being on all fours  
I take him for a walk  
Ambling along the corridor  
I am disappointed  
  
Now he comes backwards towards me  
Honey stays stuck on the garter  
I am disappointed, totally disappointed  
  
Bend over  
Your face doesn't interest me  
  
The two-legged one has bent over  
And moved into a good light  
I show him what you can do  
And I start to cry  
  
The biped stammers a prayer  
Because he's scared I'm feeling even worse  
He tries to bend over even more  
Tears run up his back  
  
Bend over  
  
Bend over, I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I don't care about your face  
Bend over once more  
  
Bend over

Hunger For Power
Incubus
----------------
Lyrics for Hunger For Power  
Performed by Incubus  
Rational human beings irrational in other ways  
Betraying each other in an unfriendly race  
All they do is think for themselves  
Ask them for some help and they'll tell you to go to Hell  
Welcome to the brutal world  
Vehemence, the way it goes  
Rejoicing for the disgrace of the successful one  
The jealousy is the weapon of the incompetent bum  
So if you think you've got your best frined  
You better look back, you never know what he might do next  
The anger is built in silence  
It's gonna cause some ignorant violence  
That's a goal rule number one  
To achieve in command  
What they've done in the past  
You're gonna let'em pay back  
I wonder why you do to others  
What you don't want them doing to you  
If prejudice has a value in life  
Evil would rule you too  
Remember for all the bad things you commit  
You're gonna pay with the same coin, you damn fool  
Breaking the barrier between patience and rage  
That are controlling you  
Now you're feeling what your best friend was going through  
That's the way the circle of life  
Has been for many years ago people are so greedy  
When they're in trouble, they look for you  
You can't lose this society battle  
Evil plans are coming to your mind  
To fight back, a sabotage  
That has happened many times  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  
Hunger for power  
Stupid fight  
You better stand straight  
Or you might fall  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
You'll never know  
What might happen  
To us all  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you

The Hostess With The Mostes' On The Ball
Irving Berlin
----------------
I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land  
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand  
One day father started digging in a field  
Hoping to find some soil  
  
He dug and he dug and what do you think?  
Oil, oil, oil  
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high  
Washington was my destination  
And now who am I?  
  
I'm the chosen party giver  
For the White House clientele  
And they know that I deliver  
What it takes to make 'em jell  
  
And in Washington I'm known by one and all  
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
They could go to Elsa Maxwell  
When they had an axe to grind  
  
They could always grind their axe well  
At the parties she designed  
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call  
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
I've a great big bar and good caviar  
Yes, the best that can be found  
And a large amount in my bank account  
When election time comes 'round  
  
If you're feeling presidential  
You can make it, yes, indeed  
There are just three things essential  
Let me tell you all you need  
  
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall  
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
Entertaining vodka drinkers  
Is a job they give to me  
Making nice guys out of stinkers  
Seems to be my cup of tea  
  
What they really need behind the iron wall  
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
There's a book of regulations  
As to who sits next to who  
  
But there might be complications  
When the blue blood's not so blue  
So the priestess with the leastes' protocol  
Is the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
An Ambassador has just reached the shore  
He's a man of many loves  
An important gent from the Orient  
To be handled with kid gloves  
  
He can come and let his hair down  
Have the best time of his life  
Even bring his new affair down  
Introduce her as his wife  
  
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall  
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
  
I've been highly complimented  
And I thank you what is more  
You'll be damned well represented  
By your new ambassador  
  
For my one ambition is to make them fall  
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball  
In the handbag that I'll carry  
There's a precious little note  
  
To their highnesses from Harry  
Introducing me he wrote:  
"I'll appreciate a favor large or small  
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball"  
  
There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes  
To make friends across the sea  
I'll make being smart an important part  
Of my foreign policy  
  
I'll cement our good relations  
When I give my first affair  
There'll be special invitations  
To the Duke and Duchess there  
  
Who's already written asking them to call  
Not the priestess with the leastes'  
But the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

Love Adjourned
Beautiful South
----------------
Your wife's got beautiful skin  
Shame it's not round her body no more  
It just came away in my hands  
As I asked her up to dance  
Just cut her out of your scrapbook  
If she ever made it in  
And if there's any old photos of her  
You know where to find the bin  
  
"Can't work it out"  
It's what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue  
  
Your wife's got beautiful teeth  
Pity they're not in the mouth no more  
They just seem to crumble and fall  
As I pinned her to the wall  
Just rub her out of your diary  
Scratch her name off your list  
And if you want to see her smiling  
Take a good look at this fist  
  
"Can't work it out"  
It's what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue  
  
You took this boy  
And you showed him insanity  
You said he must abide  
He showed you beauty  
And you showed him vanity  
Can't say that I cried  
  
"Can't work it out"  
It's what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue

Love
Judy Garland
----------------
Love can be a moment's madness  
Love can be insane  
Love can be a life of sadness and pain  
  
Love can be a summer shower  
Love can be the sun  
Love can be two hearts that flower as one  
  
It can be, fine and free  
But that kind  
Is not so very easy to find  
  
Love can be a dying ember  
Love can be a flame  
Love pledged in September  
May be dead in December  
You may not even remember it came  
  
Love can be a joy forever  
Or an empty name  
Love is almost never ever the same  
  
Love can be an evil-doer  
Love can be a fog  
Love can make you feel like you were a dog  
  
Love can be a snow-capped mountain  
Love can be the truth  
Love can be an endless fountain of youth  
  
It can be ecstasy  
But it's true  
It doesn't always happen to you  
  
Love can be a four-score failure  
Love can bring you fame  
Love fresh as the morning  
May be wild when it's 'borning  
And then without any warning, it's tame  
  
Oh love can be a sweet endeavor  
Or a dirty shame  
Love is almost never ever, the same!

Anyone Who Had A Heart
Dusty Springfield
----------------
Anyone who ever loved  
Could look at me  
And know that I love you  
Anyone who ever dreamed  
Could look at me  
And know I dream of you  
Knowing I love you so  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
What am I to do?  
  
Every time you go away  
I always say this time it's goodbye, dear  
Loving you the way I do, I take you back  
Without you I'd die, dear  
Knowing I love you so  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
What am I to do?  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
  
Anyone who had a heart could love me too  
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you?  
  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too, yeah  
Anyone who had a heart would simply take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you?  
  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too

Crash
Aerosmith
----------------
(Dum, dum..can't find anything  
Better to do...you drive me crazy)  
Sitting on a castle  
On the floor with Esmeralda  
Waiting for the Geezer  
Captain Crunch to come around  
Feeling suicidal 'cause of certain situations  
Hanging from the stairs too long  
I think I'm coming down  
It's time to Crash  
(Losin' my mind...yeah, it's time to)  
Doin' tons of colon blow  
Stuffing it in every hole  
Mile high, so am I  
Watching Jimmy kiss the sky  
Salle diner becomes a blur  
With everybody jammin'  
Republicans begin to sin  
The batwings start a slamming  
It's time to crash  
(Losin' my mind...yeah, it's time to)  
Crash  
(Yeah, maybe it's a little late but it's time to)  
Crash  
You drive me crazy  
You drive me crazy  
You drive me crazy  
Captain Billy Beemish  
Put a lamb up on a rack  
Thanks for coming Billy  
And we hope you're comin' back  
The castle will be waiting  
For the next bangers and mash  
Blanche and Marsha Reznick  
Put their marmack with their hash  
It's time to crash  
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind...

Cold Cold Heart
Hank Williams
----------------
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind,and melt your cold cold heart  
  
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry  
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try  
Why do you run and hide from life,to try it just ain't smart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
  
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory  
The more I learn to care for you,the more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Frank's Song
Tom Waits
----------------
That woman will take you, that woman will break you  
That woman will make you something you've never seen  
That woman's got claws, that woman's got laws  
Now look out man, you're gonna loose your mind  
  
I had a friend, his name was Frank  
He walked on the water and lord he sank  
We used to go stag, now he's got a hag  
It looks like Frank's got a new bag  
  
That woman will take you, that woman will break you  
That woman will make you something you've never seen  
That woman's got claws, that woman's got laws  
Now look out Frank, you're gonna loose your mind  
  
What happened to Frank, can happen to you  
Just find you a woman and watch what she'll do  
That woman will take you, that woman's gonna break you  
Look out man you're gonna loose, you're gonna loose your mind

Erasure

We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again  
I've been connected to the right line  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never

Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love

Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again

Move To The City
Guns N' Roses
----------------
You pack your bags  
And you move to the city  
There's somethin' missin' here at home  
You fix your hair  
And you're lookin' real pretty  
It's time to get it out on your own  
You're always fightin'  
With your mama and you papa  
Your family life is one big pain!  
When you, you gonna move to the city?  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move, You gotta move  
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma  
Time you gotta move  
  
You stole your mama's car  
And your daddy's plastic credit card  
You're sixteen and you can't get a job  
You're not goin' very far  
You're always ridin'  
With the teachers and the police  
This life is much too insane!  
When you, you gonna move to the city?  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move, You gotta move  
Ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma  
Time you gotta move  
Right to the city  
Where the real men get it  
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?  
Sometimes it gets too shitty!  
Come on and hit me!  
  
You're on the streets  
And it ain't so pretty  
You need to get a new what you please  
You do what you gotta do for the money  
At times you end up on your knees!  
  
I'm always buyin'  
With the local and the junkies  
This city life is one big pain!  
But you, you had to move to the city  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move, You gotta move  
Ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma  
Time you gotta move  
Oh right to the city  
With the real nitty gritty  
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?  
Sometimes it gets too shitty!  
Come on and hit me!

Love On A Farmboy's Wages
XTC
----------------
High climbs the summer sun  
High stands the corn  
And tonight when my work is done  
We will borrow your father's carriage  
We will drink and prepare for marriage  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in  
Shilling for the fellow who milks the herd  
Shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping  
How can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?  
  
Deep under winter snow  
Deep lay the lambs  
And tonight by the full moon's glow  
Flask of wine on my feather bedding  
We will drink and prepare for wedding  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People think that I'm no good  
Painting pictures carving wood  
Be a rich man if I could  
But the only job I do well is here on the farm  
On the farm  
And it's breaking my back  
  
We will borrow your father's carriage  
We will drink and prepare for marriage  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus]

Thinking 'Bout You
Yusuf Islam
----------------
When I hold your hand,  
I could fly a zillion miles with you.  
When I see your grace,  
I can see you're God's words come true.  
Every little bird above the haze,  
And fish beneath the waves,  
Knows about you  
Wouldn't they do.  
  
When I see your eyes,  
I can see rainbows in the sky.  
Being with you,  
All who parted reunite.  
Every little pearl drop in the clouds,  
And stones beneath the ground,  
Are waiting for you  
Wouldn't they do.  
  
Whatever you say  
Lightens up the burden of the day.  
Whatever you do  
Makes us ever want to follow you.  
  
Whatever they say,  
Whatever they do,  
I'll always love you.  
  
Every burning comet that zooms,  
And angels too,  
Think about you  
Wouldn't they do.  
  
Thinkin' bout you,  
I could climb a mountain in the dark.  
Listenin' to you,  
Flowers dance in the park.  
  
Whatever they say,  
Whatever they do,  
We'll always love you.  
  
The words that you say,  
Lightens up the burdens of the day.  
Whatever you do,  
Makes us want to follow you.  
  
Whatever they say,  
Whatever they do,  
I'll always love you.

If Only
Queens Of The Stone Age
----------------
If it gets you down well then I'll take it  
If it gets you up well I don't want it  
It let you down so broken-hearted  
If it gets you down well then I want it  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all  
  
So blow our mind and make it lazy  
Those long, long days with no escaping  
I hold the wheel to let it go  
Don't want to stop, don't want to know  
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all

Dream A Little Dream Of Me
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"  
Birds singing in the sycamore trees  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say nighty-night and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams, till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me

Harry! Harry, is that you as a boy?  
  
Harry:  
  
Why, it must be! He's so charming and sweet and likeable!  
  
Thing-Fish:  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy, c'mon over 'n say a few words to de nice peoples!  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
Hi, folks! Nice to be here!  
  
Thing-Fish:  
  
I's sure dere be lotsa folks like to know what yo' plans are. .. How y'intend
t'be gwine about this uncredibly serious bidniss o' growin' up in ermerica!  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
Well, I plan on making a few mistakes, having my heart broken and so forth,
using all kinds of drugs, and turning gay as soon as possible in order to
accelerate my rise to the 'top of the heap. '  
  
Thing-Fish:  
  
Ahh! Tremenjous, harry-As-A-Boy, simply tre-Menjous! You practicin' up for it
wit anybody in po-ticlar now?  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
I can't afford to study with anyone yet, since the bulk of my allowance goes
for glue and Grateful Dead tickets, but soon I hope to be on my knees in a
real homo bath house. .. Maybe when my folks go on vacation.  
  
Thing-Fish:  
  
Ain't you de clever one! Tell us, harry-As-A-Boy, howdja recide upon this heah
life-style bein' de one for you?  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
It was pretty simple, really. I lost all desire for intercourse with females
when they started carrying those briefcases and wearing suits 'n ties.  
  
Rhonda:  
  
What?  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
Let's face it: that would be like fucking a slightly more voluptuous version

To a degree. .. I mean. .. Look, I'm not stupid! I know it's all a thoroughly
workable government-sponsored program to control the Population Explosion,
and, just like every other american, I'm too concerned with my own personal
health and well being to think of devoting any of my precious time to
something as boring as 'reproduction'!  
  
Rhonda:  
  
Harry, I used to think you were merely an over-Educated shit-Head, but now
that I finally have proof, it's going to give me great pleasure to refer to
you as an over-Educated cocksucker!  
  
Harry:  
  
Well, to be honest with you, dearest, I sort of. .. Gulp, gulp. ..  
  
Rhonda:  
  
Where's the fairies on a string, harry? Huh? Riddle me this!

In My Time
Nazareth
----------------
In my life there's places I've seen,  
Places I've been in my life.  
In my life there's things I have done,  
Times I have won in my life.  
  
Ships I have known,  
Winds that have blown.  
  
In my time were people who cared,  
People who shared in my time,  
Welcomed the good accepted the bad,  
Enjoyed what I had in my time.  
  
People I've known  
Times on my own  
  
And now I'm growing old,  
In memory I can hold  
My picture book unfolds and I  
Can feel myself grow cold.  
  
In my life there's times to forget,  
Things to regret in my life,  
May have done wrong but tried to do right  
I followed the light in my life,  
But now the lights grow dim,  
My days are closing in.

Happy
Oingo Boingo
----------------
Don't got a pretty girl who loves me a lot  
Don't got a fast car that looks real hot  
Don't got a fine pad or stereo  
And I don't do well in the school where I go, go, go, go, go  
  
But I'm happy, happy  
I'm happy though the world is upside down  
I'm happy that we all made it through another day  
When I pick up the phone I still remember what to say  
I'm happy that my brain still lives inside my head  
Most of all I think I'm happy  
Happy that I ain't dead  
  
I read the paper, I saw the news  
All those people out there singin' the blues  
They get excited, why don't they just relax  
All we got to do is kick back, back, back  
  
And be happy, happy  
Happy though the whole world is ready to blow  
I'm happy that I made it through another day  
When I pick up the phone I still remember what to say  
I'm happy that my brain still lives inside my head  
Most of all I think I'm happy  
Happy that I ain't dead  
  
I know a guy with plenty of loot  
You'd never catch him in a two dollar suit  
He's got gold chains, plenty of rings  
He told me money, it don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
If you ain't happy, happy  
Happy though the whole world is upside down  
Be happy that you made it through another day  
When you pick up the phone you still remember what to say  
Be happy that your brain still lives inside your head  
Most of all I think I'm happy.....  
  
I'm happy  
I'm happy though the whole thing is ready to blow  
Be happy that the sun has rised up again  
That somewhere in this world I still got a friend  
Be happy that the big one, it hasn't dropped yet  
Be happy that you still got something  
Something, something to forget  
I'm happy  
  
(I'm happy, so happy)

I Never Knew Love
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
I asked you to come inside my heart  
And there you were  
I asked for a pure and gentle start  
And there you were  
I asked if this love could ever be  
The way that I've dreamt of it you see  
I never knew love  
I asked you to open up my eyes  
And there you were  
I asked for the keys to paradise  
And there you were  
They say only ask and you'll receive  
I never knew that applied to me  
I never knew love  
Life is good life is sweet  
It's the way that we perceive  
Cynics say we can dream  
Change your mind heal the world  
It's easy just believe  
I asked for a change in all my life  
And there you were  
You're everything I had hoped to find  
Yes, there you were  
I hope and I pray that you will find  
A peace and a joy as great as mine  
All about love  
I hope you find love

A Little Of You
Conway Twitty
----------------
Today, I put on your favorite shirt  
I know you won't see me but what can it hurt  
It's just a piece of your memory that stayed behind  
It hangs in my closet and here in my mind  
Oh, oh, in everything that I do  
There will always be a little of you  
In my soul emblazoned and blue  
There will always be a little of you  
In every smile I have to force on my face  
In every tear that I ever taste  
In every victory that I like to share  
In every loss when I wish you were there beside me  
Oh, oh, in everything that I do  
There will always be a little of you  
In my soul emblazoned and blue  
There will always be a little of you  
I'm all over the pain  
But the scars remain to remind me  
Oh, oh, in everything that I do  
There will always be a little of you  
In my soul emblazoned and blue  
There will always be a little of you  
Oh, oh, there's a little of you

Above All
Michael W. Smith
----------------
Above all powers  
Above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms  
Above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Above all powers  
Above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms  
Above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all

Beautiful Morning
Ace Of Base
----------------
What a beautiful morning  
The best in life is free  
  
What a beautiful morning  
Believe me  
  
What a mystery  
Though the world's on fire  
Yesterday's hard words is still in my head  
I feel no despair  
No regrets or sorrows  
Cause this new day  
Makes me dance on air  
  
What a golden day  
  
What a beautiful morning in my life  
The best in life is free  
I give it all away  
And I wonder what more is to come  
And this beautiful morning changed my mind  
Believe me when I say  
The shadows fading out  
  
As the day grows bright  
We are turning pages  
And we write new chapters of our life  
Some are strong and long  
Others weak with sorrows  
Keep the focus on the rising sun  
  
What a golden day  
  
What a beautiful morning in my life  
The best in life is free  
I give it all away  
And I wonder what more is to come  
And this beautiful morning changed my mind  
Believe me when I say  
Shadows fading out  
  
Believe me crows will always fly  
Believe me they are only birds  
You have to  
You have to let go and you will see things in a different light  
  
What a beautiful morning  
What a beautiful morning  
Believe me  
  
What a beautiful  
What a beautiful morning  
  
Believe me

The Stone
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
I've this creeping suspicion  
That things here are not as they seem  
Reassure me  
Of why do I feel as if I'm in too deep  
Now I've been praying  
For some way to show them I'm not what they see  
Yes I have done wrong  
But what I did I thought needed be done  
I swear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh unholy day  
If I leave now I might get away  
Oh bu this weighs on me  
As heavy as stone an as blue as I go  
  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Hold up my head when my head won't hold on  
I'll do the same if the same's what you want  
If not I'll go  
I will go a...  
  
...long way  
From that fool's mistake  
and now forever pain  
Go run, I will run and I'll be ok  
  
[Chorus]  
  
...long way  
To bury the past for I don't want to pay  
Oh how I wish this  
To turn back the clock and do over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need do  
To stay in your arms see you smile hold you close  
And now it weighs on me  
As heavy as stone and a bone-chilling cold  
  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Tell me you will

What Christmas Means To Me
Hanson

Candles burnin' low  
Lots of Mistletoe  
Lots of snow and ice  
Everywhere we go  
Chior singing carrols  
Right outside my door  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me - my love  
I see your smilin' face  
Like I've never seen before  
Though I love you madly  
It seems I love you more  
The little cards you give me  
Will touch my heart for sure  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me - my love  
I feel like runnin' wild  
Those angels and a little child - hay hay hay  
I got you 'neath the misltetoe  
I kiss you once and then some more  
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby  
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby  
And a happy happy New Year - ooooohhhhhh  
Let's deck the halls with holly  
Singing "Silent Night"  
Fill the trees with angels hair  
Pretty pretty lights  
Go to sleep and wake up  
Just before daylight  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho

Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love -ohoohoohooho

Steady
Cyndi Lauper
----------------
Friends they call me  
On the phone  
'cause I'm steady  
Talk about unhappy homes  
'cause I'm steady  
Though I don't like to let it show  
I got troubles of my own  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
  
Day to day is so unsure  
But I'm steady  
I watch people crash and soar  
But I'm steady  
The more they try  
So hard to change  
The more they stay the same  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
  
We're faced with so much  
Back and forth  
I don't need no ups and downs  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
I'm steady  
I'm steady

Hey
Q-Tip
----------------
The name is Q-Tip, enterin through the middle  
from the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles  
Comin from the maximum gain, the octane  
that's on the radio it made me feel so low  
It seems we gotta, brighten, the damp prison  
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision  
Bustin from no mo' trey-eights, now papi weight  
This joint is like a Ruger, watch it roar like a cougar  
And we gotta, move on the dancefloor  
and work it out all night that's what you came here for  
Just chem', I fills it to the rim, your shine is lookin dim  
Daddy shine the light on him, ahem it's me  
Leader of the Starfleet Force  
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course, we took the loss?  
Damn right, sure as Tina made Ike  
We gonna put it in your noggin all night, and all day  
The Trilateral commission we dissin  
Tellin citizens be straight, but like snakes they hissin  
I'll be damned if I let his song fall to the side  
Goin piggybackin shit, let's ride, c'mon  
  
I put it down, now what you gonna do (8X)  
Hey, now, what you gonna do, with yourself, hah? (4X)  
When you hear this, recognize you hear love  
MC nigga illin over be -boy dubs  
Riding through the shit like Tron  
Doesn't matter if you onboard, do you want to get on?  
Cause if you do, watch all the moves that we make  
Gotta do the things right, ain't no time for mistake  
It's the hip-hop cat that can't, fuck with Jake  
Just because he wear a badge doesn't, mean he straight so  
what you want to swallow it down or let's take it  
Disregard those who fake it, yo it doesn't matter  
about the realm, hip-hop is to the helm  
It's divine to hit the mind like slippery elms  
So put it down man, put it on down  
Put it down man, put it on down  
Put it down woman, put it on down  
Put it down man, put it on down  
Put it down man, whatchu gonna do  
Put it down woman, whatchu gonna do  
A-put it down man, whatchu gonna do  
Put it down woman, whatchu gonna do

ABBA

Sit down and listen 'cause I've got good news for you  
It was in the papers today  
Some physician had made a discovery  
This' what she had to say:  
(oooh you know that)  
  
She said that every result she had backed her  
Claiming that love's a longevity factor  
  
So lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
What a feeling when I hold you tight  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah  
  
I can imagine, I'll see in my fantasy  
I'll enjoy every day  
Making love is a dynamite drug, baby  
So why don't we start right away  
(ahh, please don't wait)  
  
I don't care if they're watching 'cause listen  
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing  
  
'cause lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
What a feeling when I hold you tight  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah

Nothing Ever Changes My Love For You
Nat King Cole
----------------
The earth may change from Summer green to Winter white  
The brightest day can change into the darkest night.  
A grey cloud may change a sky of blue  
But nothing ever changes my love for you  
  
A gentle breeze can blow into a hurricane  
A happy song can change into a sad refrain  
The oak leaf will fall when autumns through  
But nothing ever changes my love for you  
  
Time will alter Gibraltor the seas may run dry  
But you'll see that we'll be the same you and I  
A million things are bound to change as time goes on  
A million springs will come and go and when there gone  
My darling the thrill will still be new  
For nothing ever changes my love for you.  
  
My darling the thrill will still be new  
For nothing ever changes my love for you  
For nothing ever changes my love for you.

The White Stripes
----------------
There's a story  
I would like to tell  
My problem is  
Its one you know too well  
Its one you know too well  
  
Miss Suzy lee  
The one I'm speaking of  
The question is  
Is she the one I love?  
Is she the one I love?  
Alright  
Is she the one I love?  
Is she the one I love?  
  
She sent me flowers  
With her tears burned inside  
And you know what I'd do?  
I would run and hide  
I would run and hide  
  
And the paper  
On it was my name  
With the question  
Do you feel the same?  
Do you feel the same  
Alright  
  
To end this tale  
The one I'm speaking of  
I wish I had an answer but I just don't know  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?

Prisoner Of Love
Kiss
----------------
If I can survive, and if you can't deny it  
Don't give me love, no, don't even try it  
Just give me your trust, and I'll tell you no lies  
This is the truth, and I don't know why  
  
Can't you hear your heart is beatin' (Don't you hear it beatin')  
Don't you feel that sweet sweet feelin' (Can't you feel that feelin')  
Anytime you need some lovin'  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again  
  
And if you can't believe all your alibis, I can tell by that look in your eyes  
When we make love, you play hard to bet, you bet, what you give is what you
get  
  
Anytime I see you goin' (Anytime I see you gone)  
Everytime the feelin's growin' (This feelin's growin')  
Anytime I need your lovin'  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again  
I know it's much too late, but I can't help this feelin', no I can't look away  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again

Black Legions
Venom
----------------
High on a ridge where the darklord stands sending black legions to crush the
lands  
Captures of hades transporting the crown into the pit of this unholy row  
Do it all alone down into Belial's home live then die Satan calls his evil
child  
Strengthens his force as the darkness falls laughs at the angels their feeble
calls  
High on their fortress that crumbles before all that in touch with the dark
evil law  
Do it all alone down into Belial's home strike the final chord hail unto the
overlord  
High on a ridge where the darklord stands sending black legions to crush the
lands  
Captures of hades transporting the crown ever further ever down into the pits
of hell  
Now in the bleakness the elders recant thinking of histories the ancients
relent  
Gathered in circles before their host there's no one soul he desires most.  
Do it all alone way down into Belial's home strike a chord hail unto the
overlord

Black Fly
ZZ Top
----------------
Starts with a typical ZZ riff, sounds like ZZ meets James Bond.  
  
Black fly buzzin', buzzin' around  
Black fly flyin' from town to town  
Black fly lookin' around and around  
What's he gonna do when he finds her?  
  
He got the mojo workin' overtime

Chasin' his honey with a honeysuckle vine  
Who's so lucky and gets to kiss her?  
  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, that's right  
  
Flyin' round lookin' for a black cat bone  
Flyin' with John the conqueror showin'  
Messin' around with a honey-bee  
Will she kiss him or sting him, what's it gonna be?  
  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, that's right  
  
Black fly buzzin, buzzin' around  
Black fly flyin' from town to town

A Mother's Prayer
Celine Dion
----------------
I pray you'll be my eyes  
And watch him where she goes  
And help him to be wise  
Help me to let go  
Every mother's prayer  
Every child knows  
Lead him to a place  
Guide him with your grace  
To a place where he'll be safe  
I pray he finds your light  
And holds it in his heart  
  
As darkness falls each night  
Remind him where you are  
Every mother's prayer  
Every child knows  
Need to find a place  
Guide him to a place  
Give him faith so she'll be safe  
Lead him to a place  
Guide him with your grace  
To a place where he'll be safe

Where Does Love Go When It Dies
Def Leppard
----------------
Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God  
Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost  
Could you ever take a life when all was lost  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more  
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor  
Could you open up your heart then close the door  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Every word you whisper  
All the tears you hide  
You die for love when it's alive  
But where does love go when it dies  
  
If you came across your dream would you walk on by  
Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die  
And is there room inside your mind for one more try  
And would it ever be enough  
  
I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave  
Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave  
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light  
And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now  
  
If you woke up from your sleep blood on your hands  
Would you wash the pain away no one understands  
There must be someone out there who can help you breathe again  
And would it ever be enough

Apache Tears
Johnny Cash
----------------
Hoof prints and foot prints deep ruts the wagons made  
The victor and the loser came by here  
  
No head stones but these bones bring Mascalero death moans  
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands laying here  
  
Petrified but justified are these Apache tears  
Dead grass dry roots hunger crying in the night  
  
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here  
And who saw the young squaw they judged by their whiskey law  
  
Tortured 'til she died of pain and fear  
Where the soldiers lay her back are the black Apache tears  
  
The young men the old men the guilty and the innocent  
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears  
  
The red men the white men no fight ever took this land  
So don't raise the dust when you pass here  
  
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these Apache tears

Wedding Day In Funeralville
John Prine
----------------
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
Your soup spoon's on your right  
The King and Queen will alternate  
With the refrigerator light  
They'll be boxing on the TV show  
The colored kids will sing  
Hoo ray for you and midnight's oil  
Let's burn the whole damn thing  
Felicia is my dark horse girl  
I'll take her if it rains  
She throws up punch upon the host  
And says many stupid things  
But she ain't so bad  
When we're all alone she's as different as can be  
She's a part a my heart, don'tcha pull us apart  
She's like one of the family  
Oh no, trouble in the attic  
Won't somebody turn on a light?  
Got so, so many troubles  
Can't even tell wrong from right  
I'm gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks, tip my hat and say goodnight  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
My car is stuck in Washington  
And I cannot find out why  
Come sit beside me on the swing  
And watch the angels cry  
It's anybody's ballgame  
It's everybody's fight  
And the street lamp said as he nodded his head  
It's lonesome out tonight  
Oh no, trouble in the attic  
Won't somebody turn on a light?  
Got so, so many troubles  
Can't even tell wrong from right  
I'm gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks, tip my hat and say goodnight  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?

You Gave Me A Mountain
Frankie Laine
----------------
Born in the heat of the desert  
My mother died giving me life  
Deprived of the love of a father  
Blamed for the loss of his wife  
  
You know, Lord, I've been in a prison  
For something that I've never done  
It's been one hill after another  
But I've climbed them all, one by one  
  
But this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain  
A mountain I may never climb  
And is isn't a hill any longer  
You gave me a mountain this time  
  
My woman tired of the hardships  
Tired of the grief and the strife  
So tired of working for nothing  
Tired of being my wife  
  
She took my one ray of sunshine  
She took my pride and my joy  
She took my reason for living  
She took my small baby boy  
  
So this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain  
A mountain I may never climb  
And is isn't a hill any longer  
You gave me a mountain this time

Distant Fingers
Patti Smith
----------------
When, when will you be landing?  
When, when will you return?  
Feel, feel my heart expanding  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered,  
I'm so tired I quit  
Take me forever, it doesn't matter  
Deep inside of your ship.  
  
La, la la la la la landing.  
Please, oh oh won't you return?  
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,  
You and your alien arms  
  
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl  
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you  
Oh you know, I would go anywhere at all  
'cause no star is too far with you, with you  
  
La, la la la la la landing.  
Please, oh oh won't you return?  
Feel, feel my heart expanding,  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered,  
I'm so tired I quit  
Take me forever, it doesn't matter  
Deep inside of your ship  
Land, land  
  
Oh I am waiting for you,  
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,  
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine  
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers  
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,  
Oh I am waiting for you

Cross On The Highway
Hank Williams Jr.
----------------
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost y two friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and there's curves  
But the one we got to observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime, night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the side of the highway  
  
Now Derrick Thomas was a champion no one can deny that  
He led the Alabama Crimson Tide in all time total sacks  
But his heart was even bigger than all his natural skill  
He always helped kids in the city and you know what  
I think he always will  
Now my buddy Mike Tellis was a good man everyone loved him so  
He took care of his dear father 'til he too was called to go  
How my little girl cried when we all got the dreaded news  
She said but Daddy Derrick and Mike will always be with us  
Don't children always tell the truth  
  
I never paid no attention anytime I passed one by  
Oh but now I say a prayer because now I know why  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news  
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel  
So God help us through these troubled times  
And please bless us with peace of mind  
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away  
  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken from this mean old world  
Oh there's warning signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway

Every Ghetto, Every City
Lauryn Hill
----------------
I was just a little girl  
Skinny legs, a press and curl  
My mother always thought I'd be a star  
But way before my record deal,  
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill  
Made sure that I'd never go too far  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem  
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill  
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun  
"Kill the guy" in Carter park  
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark  
Watching kids show off the stolen ones  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back,  
Looking back, looking back, looking back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel  
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles  
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu  
Main street roots tonic with the dreds  
A beef patty and some coco bread  
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe  
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather  
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together  
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
Drill teams on Munn street  
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef  
Moving Records was on Central Ave.  
I was there at dancing school  
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool  
Unaware of what we didn't have  
Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker  
  
July 4th races off of Parker  
Fireworks at Martin stadium  
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggers be  
And car thieves got away through Irvington  
Hillside brings beef with the cops  
Self-Destruction record drops  
And everybody's name was Muslim  
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state  
And everybody used to do the wop  
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body  
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party  
I wish those days, they didn't stop  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back

The Monkees

By Michael Nesmith  
My latest sun is sinking fast,  
My race is nearly run,  
My strongest trials now have passed,  
My triumph is begun.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, bear my longing heart to Him  
Who bled and died for me,  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin  
And brings me victory.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Fade out...

No Brakes
John Waite
----------------
I can't take you to the movies  
And I can't tell the real thing  
From a fake  
But I'm curled up tight  
In your Chevrolet  
And baby you got wow  
You've got what it takes  
You've got no brakes  
I can't take you anywhere these days  
Baby you're going wild  
Your lips and nylons  
Baby you've got what I think  
I think it takes  
You've got no taste  
You've got what it takes  
A gal with no brakes at all  
Whispering in my ear  
When you're breathing baby  
Hold me near  
Closer closer still  
Ah woo  
Yeah  
Baby you look so good tonight  
Take that dress right off  
Stand there right in front of me  
Baby you're going to make  
My poor rocking heart break  
Got no brakes  
You've got what it takes tonight  
For a gal with no brakes  
Going to make something straight tonight  
Gonna gonna make it all right  
The morning sun  
Coming up  
We ain't got no brakes  
We ain't got no brakes  
Ow ow  
We ain't got no brakes  
We ain't got none  
We ain't got no brakes  
Ow

Touchdown Jesus
Tim McGraw
----------------
I dusted off my Bible today  
Read the words and read yeah, every word He said  
He talked about forgiveness and a better way  
I raised my hands above my head and I said  
  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
There was a little girl just down the street  
They were prayin' for a miracle but runnin' outta hope  
Some stranger was an angel and he gave her what she needed  
You oughta see her today, that was ten years ago  
  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
That's just another story wrote away  
All He needs is just a little bit of your faith  
And it's touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
Old man was losin' his bottle with the liquor  
Ruined his name and brought his family shame and pain  
Then he stumbled into church one day and he found something bigger  
Beat the devil at his own game and he poured him down the drain, yeah  
  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
That's just another story wrote away  
All He needs is just a little bit of your faith  
And it's touchdown Jesus  
Oh, touchdown Jesus  
  
That little girl turned twenty one today  
That old man well he found himself a better way  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus

Ahh, Let's Get Ill
LL Cool J
----------------
I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather  
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather  
Last of the red hot loving MC's  
Looking for a little, that's my theory  
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting  
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting  
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder  
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater  
Looking, learning, the one you're liking  
Listen and you will love what I'm writing  
Ladies love, long, hard and lean  
And now you know what L.L. means  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get ill!  
Come on now  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
  
Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie  
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys  
My literature is the land's highest law  
The man of the brand, one you look out for  
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker  
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker  
Listen to my rhyme  
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line  
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late  
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates  
First not last, leader of the class, see  
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee  
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's  
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E  
I bust your lip, my level won't slip  
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip  
Come on!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref  
When I die, there will be no lovers left  
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer  
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter  
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud  
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud  
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club  
Ladies Love, the man you dream of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never ever lost, not lonely or alone  
You can call me the last Capone  
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids  
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid  
Cause the ladies know my bass is low  
Rocking L after L ever since the intro  
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro  
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All over the land they listen to my jams  
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand  
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list  
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff  
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list  
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless  
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn  
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: x2]

God Only Knows
Gary Numan
----------------
I was waiting for something  
I was listening to my breathing  
Like a man listening to life  
  
I was looking for fire  
It could take me or leave me  
It could all just burn away  
  
The oxygen law  
It remains me  
  
I'd been surrounded for hours  
By the sound of thinking metal  
And I knew something was wrong  
  
I can tell you what fear is  
It is the smell of burning  
And I'd been close once before  
  
I waited a long time  
How I survived God only knows  
It seemed like forever  
How I survived God only knows  
I don't like the memory  
How I survived God only knows  
How I survived God only knows  
  
I remember the feeling  
I'll remember forever  
How it all just came apart  
  
I don't believe in praying  
I don't believe in a God  
Now I question everything  
  
The dreamer is gone  
I'm an old man  
  
I could tell you of horror  
I could show you the pieces  
But I just want to forget  
  
I'm not sure if I saw it  
I'm not sure if I heard it  
I just screamed 'I can't get out'  
'I can't get out'

Everytime I Love Her
Hank Snow
----------------
Diesel smoke climbin' to the clear blue sky I sit here wonderin' wanderin' why  
I leave her everytime I love her  
Green grass growin' by picket fence Lord I just don't make no sense  
But I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just knowin' that she'll be there  
With her dark brown eyes and her yellow hair  
And I love her Lord knows I love her  
Though my mind's dis-satisfied just a hoppin' that big ole Mack and ride  
And leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
  
One of these days I want to go back  
To that yelllow haired girl and the tumble down shack  
And never leave her all I do is love her  
Well I guess to that I'll be content  
Just to drivin' this track and sendin' home the rent  
And leave her everytime I love her  
Well I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
You guess it I really love her

Internal War
Unearth
----------------
Internal War  
Killing our own  
Burn the ones that have sinned against  
Claim their lives in your death romance  
Arm the young with your hunting toys  
By your own actions you are all to blame  
Power in the wrong hands our scaffold is destroyed  
Children killing children because our government has ignored  
I sling my arrows to shatter your walls  
No more creating victims from ignorance  
Left to second both sides  
Each one cries and lies  
No More War  
You've killed again  
My life for what  
Bound hands  
Yes you've all killed again  
Stand by as dying children wait for life  
The line has been crossed again  
How long will it take  
The line has been crossed again  
How long will it take to protect life

Fraulein
Chuck Berry
----------------
Far across the deep blue water lives an old captain's daughter  
On the banks of the old river Rhine  
Where I loved her and I left her and now I can't forget her  
'Cause she is my pretty Fraulein  
  
Fraulein, Fraulein walk down by the river  
Each night when the stars began to shine  
By these same stars above you I swear that I love you  
You are my pretty Fraulein  
  
When my memory start to wander  
Each day I grow fonder of the sweetheart that I left behind  
In a moment of my glory her face comes before me  
The face of my pretty Fraulein  
  
Fraulein, Fraulein look up toward the heaven  
Pretend that your hand is holdin' mine  
By the same stars above you I swear I still love you  
And I always will my Fraulein

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you? X2  
I'll do my hair up all high and wild, wild flowers tied  
Green swimming pool pink flamingos, high christmas lights  
Blue bedspread and silver tinsel, my hearts delight  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you? X2  
Do you like my fake nails daddy?  
Black palmtree pink tiger-stripes  
Used to go to the kamfreena  
Will you buy me a slice of cherry pie?  
We didn't know much, just worked at night  
Sweet trailer light  
1, 2...  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you  
He said: Lana-Ray, will you serve me lemonade?  
And I said: yes Bill I will, it's the day of the parade  
  
And you look even more handsome than you did  
The day that I left you  
How do you spend your nights, honey?  
Still watchin' tv? I long to be in your arms, honey,  
Come back to me  
Please  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?  
All I want is to feel good  
All I want is to feel good  
All I want is to feel good, you know?  
Come on now if you want to  
If you want to if you want to  
It's been a long time  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?

Want to tell you about my baby, you know she comes around  
Just about five feet-four from her head to the ground  
You know she comes around here just about midnight

Guilty
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
Yeah baby, I've been drinking,  
And I shouldn't come by I know  
But I found myself in trouble darling,  
And I had nowhere else to go  
  
Got some whiskey from a bar man,  
Got some cocaine from a friend  
I just had to keep on moving,  
Till I was back in your arms again  
  
Well I'm guilty, yeah I'm guilty,  
I'll be guilty for the rest of my life  
How come I never do,  
What I'm supposed to do  
How come nothing that I try to do ever turns out right  
  
Well you know how it is with me baby,  
You know I just can't stand myself  
It takes a whole lot of medicine,  
For me to pretend to be somebody else.

Check this out, yeah, yeah  
All my niggas take a walk with me  
You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me  
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be  
  
And how I stack figures  
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga  
I get money I ain't gotta do a crime  
Shit I hit dimes, what I need with a nine  
  
Before y'all judge me, be clear  
We got nothing but heat here, beware we here  
What's my name, got chicks twisted like  
What's my game?  
  
Pimp things still the same  
I smash it, I don't harass it  
Ma' I'm a baller I score and pass it  
Feel me, still be filthy  
  
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty  
And this is what we came do  
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through, come on  
  
It's right around eleven o'clock  
One of your girls just called  
Asked you how you look, are you ready?  
You tell her you look hot  
  
Not to worry at all  
Niggas will be shook, y'all doin' it heavy  
She's telling you she might change  
But you tell her not to  
  
She know that she looks stunning  
It'll be fine  
The club will be full of game  
But none of that has got'chu  
  
Me, I think you're running  
'Cause I'm the one  
  
I don't know what you came to do girl  
What you came to do tonight  
But I came to party, oh

But I came to party, oh  
  
You're probably thinking to yourself  
What's the occasion?  
And believe me girl I don't do sex for fun  
The perfect gentleman in every situation  
  
And the only thing that's missing - is the one  
Is it you?  
  
I don't know what you came to do girl  
What you came to do tonight  
But I came to party, oh

To open up your mind  
That's exactly what you are open  
Look at the memorizing grind  
She should be a crime  
Damn baby you're a star  
You're smoking  
  
You're probably thinking to yourself  
What's the occasion?  
And believe me girl I don't do sex for fun  
The perfect gentleman in every situation  
And the only thing that's missing, is the one

Gonna See My Friend
Pearl Jam
----------------
Do you want to hear something sad?  
We are but victims of desire  
I'm gonna shake this day  
I wanna shake this day before I retire  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
  
Bueno sera, I won't be long before we all walk off the wire  
Well I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require  
Bueno sera I will come in quick  
Don't want my flame to get no higher  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm gonna see my friend  
Gonna see my friend, make it go away  
  
Want to leave it all.  
Want to give it up.  
Want to see it go once and for all  
Want to view it cho'  
Want a little bit home  
Want to be there  
  
Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, ?  
Gonna take me an astral plane  
I'm gonna tunnel through denial  
But I'm gonna shake this day  
I wanna shake this day before I retire  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

I Know A Dream When I See One
Dean Martin
----------------
I know a dream when I see one  
For I'm a dreamer you know  
I know a dream when I hold one  
Do you mind if I never let you go  
I'm so afraid if I kiss you  
You'll vanish as dreams always do  
But make no mistake although I'm wide awake  
I know a dream when I see one  
And I see one when I look at you  
But make no mistake although I'm wide awake  
I know a dream when I see one  
And I see one when I look at you

Well I just can't believe it's time for leavin',  
Even though I've been deceivin' you,  
Guess I guessed that I've been through it wrong again, baby,  
Though I remember when I fell in love with you.  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Baby I'm not gonna let you go this easy,  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Oh I just can't get you outta my mind.  
After all this time we've been together,  
It just ain't right to throw it all away,  
Yes I know we have seen some stormy weather,  
Though I know tomorrow's gonna be a brand new day.  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Baby I'm not gonna let you go this easy,  
Don't you think we ought a try it one more time,  
Oh I just can't get you outta my mind.

Not No More
Backstreet Boys
----------------
Not No More  
  
  
Oooh oooh  
She stayed with 'em all  
But she got her own place  
She made me wait too long  
But you let me hit the second date yeah  
  
She's always asking me for my  
But girl you got your own  
I'm always trying to teach her things  
But her tricks fooled on  
  
She didn't stick around  
But now you hold me down  
I've been there and I tell you now girl  
She's my every don't  
But you are my everyone  
  
That's why she used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more (not no more)  
  
She'd work my last nerve,  
You made it all good  
She wouldn't do the things I like  
But always knew you would  
Mmmmmmmm  
  
I couldn't let you go, I wanna keep it on the low  
Cause I never had nothing like this before  
And I let you know you are so incredible  
That's why I'm telling you  
  
She used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more  
  
No more wondering just where we stand  
No more feeling like I'm the other man  
Girl I need to know if you are down to stay  
No more should've, would've, could've been  
Cause I'm through with yesterday  
  
She used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more (not no more)  
  
Used to fight for her  
But not no more  
Used to cry for her  
But not no more  
  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more  
  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more

Save Me
Queen
----------------
It started off so well  
They said we made a perfect pair  
I clothed myself in your glory and your love  
How I loved you  
How I cried  
The years of care and loyalty  
Were nothing but a sham it seems  
The years belie we lived the lie  
"I love you 'til I die"  
  
Save me, save me, save me  
I can't face this life alone  
Save me, save me, save me  
I'm naked and I'm far from home  
  
The slate will soon be clean  
I'll erase the memories  
To start again with somebody new  
Was it all wasted  
All that love?  
I hang my head and I advertise  
A soul for sale or rent  
I have no heart, I'm cold inside  
I have no real intent  
  
Save me, save me, save me  
I can't face this life alone  
Save me, save me  
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home  
  
Each night I cry and still believe the lie  
I love you 'til I die  
  
(Save me, save me, save me)  
Yea, yeah  
Save me yeah save me oh save me  
Don't let me face my life alone  
Save me, save me  
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home

13 Stitches
NOFX
----------------
The first time I saw the Descendants, they were the fastest band I'd ever seen  
No one in the crowd really cared for them, we were waiting for the Alley Cats
to play  
After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl, on Rodney on the Roq late Sunday
night  
That was enough, for me I hopped the bus, to Licorice Pizza and bought my all
time favorite record  
  
The next time I went to the Whiskey, it was DOA with Millions of Dead Cops  
The latter band played faster than I could believe  
But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked  
'Cept John Wayne was a Nazi, and Joey Shithead was a drunk  
Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp, 'cause having long hair was a
mistake  
  
The third time I went to the hospital, I needed 13 stitches in my head  
I managed to catch about 6 rounds of Ill Repute, then some suicidal threw me
into a post  
My girlfriend started to cry 'cause we had to leave before DRI played fifty
lousy songs  
My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes  
But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash

One More Story
Peter Cetera
----------------
One more story  
Then it's time for bed  
One more fairy tale  
Then rest your weary head  
One more kiss, I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Go to sleep now  
You've had a busy day  
Hold me in your dreams  
I won't be far away  
One more kiss then I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
  
I can't believe just how fast you're growing  
I'm gonna cry when you're old enough  
To go and be on your own  
But until that very moment  
Everything's gonna be all right  
You'll still be here when I wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Everything's gonna be all right

Doncha Bother Me
Rolling Stones
----------------
I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more."  
I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more."  
Well I'm looking for my face  
And I got no place to go  
  
I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more."  
I said, "Oh no, doncha follow me no more."  
Well, pick your own mind  
And don't you touch mine no more  
  
Still waiting here for a single idea  
In your clothes and your hair  
I wore it last year  
Oh no, doncha follow me no more  
  
I said, "Oh no, doncha copy me no more."  
I said, "Oh no, doncha copy me no more."  
Well, the lines around my eyes  
Are protected by a copyright law  
  
Well, all the clubs and the bars  
And the little red cars  
Not knowing why, but trying to get high  
Oh no, doncha follow me no more  
  
Doncha follow  
Doncha follow

Throw Back
Fabolous
----------------
[Fabolous]  
Don't try to fuck wit me y'all  
Cause you cant  
I stay way ahead of the game  
Ya know, catch me if you can nigga  
  
Throwback this, throwback that  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
I rock the reds pete rose when I'm in the 'natti  
And [repeat: x4]  
You cant see the semi-automatti  
When I'm in the chi' you think they ain't that shocked  
To see the kid roll through in the st. pats socks  
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on soul train  
The bulls, when mike had hair and a gold chain  
I get the spirit in St. Louis, how could the god lose  
I do back flips in the ozzie cardinals  
They love me in Cleveland, every time I travel there  
I'm in the Indians or that cavaliers  
When I hit Minnesota, that kid from brooklyn wear  
The vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year  
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back  
20 years with the bucks and brewers throw backs  
  
[Chorus:]  
Throwback this, throwback that  
They even look better with the matching hat  
All you gotta check is the players stats  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
Throwback this, throwback that  
They even look better with the matching hat  
All you gotta check is the players stats  
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at  
  
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder  
Rock the trailblazer warm-up, cause Portland gets colder  
And even the pimps be jealous  
When I'm in the floor seat at the forum in the m.p.l.s.  
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest  
This the rams before they moved to the midwest  
When I'm in the bay with it, I don't play with it  
I'm in the athletics with the matchin' A's fitted  
This ain't even for the minors  
Cause they don't know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers  
Seattle, probably heard different rumors  
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.  
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway  
Or the nuggets that make them yell  
In phoenix I do the old suns  
Cause the new jerseys is cool, but nothings really like the old ones  
Ya know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In new york what I wear the the club may vary  
Mets or Yankees like the subway series  
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean  
In a hot red Soxs or Celtics green  
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these  
In a size 56 Phillies  
In jersey I got the nets on  
That you can bet on  
In d.c. I couldn't pull it  
Without the bullets  
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long  
Them birds know I got the falcons or the hawks on  
That peach Tampa bay don't hit the streets too often  
Not even Miami could take the heat of dolphins  
Ain't no complaints on  
When I'm in New Orleans with the saints on  
In Houston I pass hoes  
In the Astros  
In Dallas I always gotta have  
The cowboys or the mavs  
? to keep it coming, and I'ma keep it coming  
  
[Chorus]

Girl, I Think The World About You
Lionel Richie
----------------
Sweet little woman can't you see  
That you're the only one for me  
You make me feel good, so good inside  
Stay by me woman for the rest of my life  
And as I think of you more every day  
There's only one thing I can say  
And that's:  
  
Girl, I think the world about you  
Always thinkin' of you  
Girl, I think the world about you  
I'm always thinkin' of you  
  
So many wonders in your world it seems,  
You're the picture of a woman - a little girl's dream,  
You seem so weak sometimes to be so strong,  
You make a man like me finally to belong,  
No words can say how much I need you so,  
But oh my love I want the world to know  
  
Girl, I think the world about you  
Always thinkin' of you  
Girl, I think the world about you  
I'm always thinkin' of you  
  
There's no words to say how much I need you so,  
But oh sweet girl I want the world to know  
  
Girl, I think the world about you  
Always thinkin' of you  
Girl, I think the world about you  
I'm always thinkin' of you

Brothers Of The Road
Allman Brothers Band
----------------
Silent shadows of the night  
Faded with the morning light  
We just wrote another song  
Maybe a word or two is wrong  
There's so much that could be said  
It's hard to write it in a line  
But when the final word is read  
Maybe something could be said  
For all the brothers of the road  
Just like you, we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we don't lose we're bound to win  
  
Somehow they gave it all a name  
Just like a southern hurricane  
We play our music like a storm  
They say a brand new sound was born  
We're all brothers of the road  
Just like you, we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we don't lose we're bound to win  
  
Some of us fell along the way  
We came together, not too proud to pray  
But the music must go on  
So there's no one left out there all alone  
We're just brothers of the road  
Casting shadows in the night  
Big wheels rolling on and on  
But everything's gonna be all right

Girls! Girls! Girls!
Elvis Presley
----------------
Girls, goin' swimming,  
Girl, in bikinis,  
A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay  
Girls, on the beaches,  
  
Girls, oh, what a peaches,  
So pretty, lord I could cry  
I'm just a red blooded boy  
And I can't stop thinkin' about  
  
Girls, sailin' sailboats,  
Girls, water skiin',  
They'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay  
Girls, big and brassy,  
Girls, small and sassy,  
Just give me one of each kind  
  
I'm just a red blooded boy  
And I can't stop thinkin' about  
Girls! girls! girls! girls!  
  
And when I pick up a sandwich too much  
A crunchy crunchety  
A crunchety crunch  
I never ever get to finish my lunch  
Because there's always bound to be a bunch of  
  
Girls, in tight sweaters,  
Girls, in short dresses,  
A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay  
Girls, out boatin'  
Girls, just a floatin'  
So pretty, lord I could cry.  
  
I'm just a red blooded boy  
And I can't stop thinkin' about  
Girls! girls! girls! girls! girls! girls!

In Hiding
Pearl Jam
----------------
I shut and locked the front door  
No way in or out  
I turned and walked the hallways  
And pulled the curtains down  
yeah I knelt and emptied the mouths of every plug around  
But nothing's sound  
nothing's sound  
  
I'd stay where my last step left me  
Ignored all my rounds  
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls  
They were upside down  
  
I swallow my words to keep from lying  
I swallow my face just to keep from biting  
Yeah, I swallowed my breath, I went deep,  
I was diving, I was diving  
Yeah, I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I'm in hiding  
  
It's been about three days now  
Since I've been aground  
i'm no longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now  
Yeah, it's funny how things change so much  
It's all state of mind  
  
I swallow my words to keep from lying  
I swallow my face just to keep from biting.  
I, I am, I swallow my breath, I went deep,  
I was diving, I was diving  
Yeah, I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened  
  
[Repeat x8]  
Now I'm in hiding

White Lines By Duran Duran
Counting Crows
----------------
Fun baby...  
  
Freeze... Rock!  
  
Bass..  
  
Oh white... White(repeat 3x) ooooo..  
  
(chorus 1)  
White lines (vision dreams of passion)  
blowin through my mind (and all the while I think of you)  
Pipe cries (a very strange reaction)  
for us to unwind (the more I see, the more I do)  
something like a phenomenom (baby)  
tellin your body to come along, but white lines, blow away....  
  
Blow... Rock it... Blow..  
  
Ticket to ride, white line highway  
tell all your friends that they can come my way  
pay your toll  
sell your soul  
pound for pound cost more than gold  
the longer you stay, the more you pay  
my white lines go a long way  
either up your nose or through your veins  
with nothing to gain except killin your brain  
  
Freeze... Rock (repeat 4x) ... Go  
  
Get higher baby  
get higher baby  
and don't ever come down... Freebase  
  
Arang-dig-dangity-dang-gitang  
arang-dig-dangity-dang-gitang  
arang-dig-dangity-dang-dang-gity-dang-itang  
  
Pipe cries (pure as the driven snow)  
connected to my mind (and now I'm havin fun baby)  
pipe rides (its getting kind of low)  
cuz it makes you feel so fine (i need some one-on-one baby)  
  
Don't let it blow yor mind away (baby)  
And go to a little hide away  
cuz whitle lines, blow away....  
  
Blow... Rock... Blow...  
  
A million magic crystals  
painted pure and white  
a multi-million dollars  
Almost over night  
twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt  
and if you get hooked baby  
its nobodyelses fault, so don't do it!  
  
Blow... Rock (repeat 4x)  
  
Higher baby  
get higher baby  
get higher baby  
And don't ever come down... Freebase!  
  
Don't you get to high (don't you get to high baby)  
Turns you on (you really turn me on and on)  
told you to come down (my temperature is risin)  
when the thrill is gone (no, I don't want you to go)  
  
A street kid gets arrested  
gonna do some time  
he got out three years from just to commit more crime  
a business man is caught, with 24 kilos  
hes out on bail and out of jail  
And that's the way it goes... Rrrhuh!  
  
Sugar... Cane (repeat 2x)  
  
Ahletes reject it  
governors correct it  
ganstars, thugs and smugglers are throully respected  
the money gets divided  
The women get excited  
now I'm broke and its no joke  
Its hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it  
  
Freeze... Rock (repeat 4x)rrruh.. Go  
  
Get higher baby  
Get higher girl

with no shoes or clothes

And sniffed it up his nose

Something's Broken
Tim McGraw
----------------
Think something's broken then again nothin's smokin'  
Or shakin' or chokin' like my ol' truck  
But I think something's broken  
And I think it's worth notin'  
It started about the time  
She got all packed up  
  
Could be my ego, could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin' eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasn't jokin'  
  
Think something's broken  
'Cause I'm just layin' round hopin'  
That maybe any moment  
I'll get on track  
But I think something's broken  
All locked up or frozen cause I can't go forward  
And I sure can't go back  
  
Could be my ego, could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin' eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasn't jokin'  
  
Think it's my heart  
Comin' eye to eye  
With the truth  
She wasn't jokin'  
  
I know something's broken  
I Just started smokin'  
And shakin'and chokin'  
Like my old truck

Black Serenade
Slayer
----------------
Terrorize frozen eyes stare deep in me  
Paralyzed inside death breeds on your pain  
Pretty lace lie in hate you wear my scars  
Terrified you find that you push me too far  
Your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh  
Rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul  
  
Petrified that I decide the moment of your death  
Belongs to me the taste is sweet it's so unreal  
  
Your God weeps, it bleeds, it begs for me  
God is letting you recover  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Scream your Song the Black Serenade  
Live in fear a mind insane  
  
Voice inside my head  
Your face still shows itself to me  
Telling me you're dead  
Staring at your lifeless body  
I saw you fucking die  
My mind's tearing itself apart  
Screaming from the inside  
Release this pain from my fucking heart  
  
Destroy the empty shell  
Smash away the haunting fear  
I hate your endless stare  
Watching as I fuck your corpse  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Walk on through a tortured mind  
You'll scream your song in time  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade  
  
Live in fear no coming back  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Walk on through a tortured mind  
You'll scream your song in time  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade  
Live in fear death is back

Cannibal's Hymn
Nick Cave
----------------
You have a heart and I have a key  
Lie back and let me unlock you  
Those heathens you hang with down by the sea  
All they want to do is defrock you  
I know a river, where we can dream  
It will swell up, burst it's banks,  
Babe, and rock you  
But if you're gonna dine with them cannibals  
Sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten  
But I'm glad you've come around  
Here with your animals  
And your heart that is bruised but unbeaten  
And beating like a drum  
  
I will sit like a bird on a fence  
Sing you songs with a happy ending  
Swoop down and tell you that it don't make sense  
To attack the very thing you're defending  
Didn't I just buy that dress for you?  
That pink paper pinafore that you keep mending  
Well, if you're gonna dine with the cannibals  
Sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten  
But I'm glad you've come around  
Here with your animals  
And your heart that is banging and beating  
And banging like a gong  
  
I can see that they've hurt you, dear  
Here is some moonlight to cloak us  
And I will never desert you here  
Unpetaled among the crocus  
Allow me, my love, to allay your fear  
As I swim, in and out of focus  
But if you're gonna dine with the cannibals  
Sooner or later, darling, you're gonna get eaten  
But I'm glad you've come around  
Here with your animals  
And your heart that is bruised but bleating  
And bleeding like a lamb  
Banging like a gong  
Beating like a drum

Apple And Cinnamon
Utada Hikaru
----------------
Tell me what is on your mind  
Help me, 'cause I'd like to know  
What the hell is going on?  
Never thought I'd sing this song  
  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent, so simple and innocent, so simple and innocent  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last  
  
Happiness don't last that long  
But what we had was beautiful  
  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
Let's not get started with the he said, she said  
Sometimes it just doesn't go on as planned  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent, so simple and innocent, so simple and innocent  
  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last  
  
Please don't look at me like that, oh  
Please don't look at me, don't look at me like that, oh  
You can't look at me like that, aah  
Please don't look at me, don't look at me like that, oh  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent, so simple and innocent, so simple and innocent  
  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon, like apple and cinnamon  
  
I can't believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
(Chemistry like apple and cinnamon)  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last

Do I Make Myself Clear
Etta James
----------------
With Sugar Pie Desanto  
  
I don't wanna believe  
The bad things about you  
Oh, no, now  
  
Cause if they're true  
I'll have to get along without you  
Oh, ooh, now  
  
I said the word, the sound  
The song about the things you do  
  
Moving and a grooving  
Using and a fooling  
Chasing around every skirt in town  
If it's true, you'll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said you're gonna have to  
Stop and check yourself  
Oh, yeah, now  
  
I'm not gonna have a man  
That's got somebody else, oh, no  
Oh, you tell him now, girl, now, now  
  
So if you're running around, baby  
Thinking of putting me down  
You're wrong  
  
Taking away what belongs to me  
Giving to her when I'm in need  
If it's true, you'll be on your way  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said, do, do I  
Do I make myself clear  
Do you understand me  
Do, do I, do I make myself clear  
Oh, you better listen to her now  
  
Oh, yeah, ohh, yeah, now  
Oh, oh, oh...  
  
So why won't you try to do  
Something to change it  
Yeah, yeah  
  
And make me know it's not  
The way they claim it, oh, yeah  
Now let me tell you something  
  
All I wanted you to be true, honey  
Love me like you say you do, oh, yeah  
And I won't care for what they say  
Instead, I'll turn my head and walk away  
But if it's true, you know what to do  
  
Do I make myself clear  
Do I make myself clear  
  
I said, do, do I  
Do I make myself clear  
And oh, oh, oh, yeah, now  
Oh, oh...  
  
I said do, do, do, do  
Do I make myself clear

No Love Lost
Yngwie Malmsteen
----------------
Enough is enough  
I'm nobody's fool  
I won't take no more  
Oh now I'm out the door  
I won't live by anyone's rules  
  
I feel it's safe to say I'm on my own  
It's just another lesson learned  
  
No love lost  
  
Life's like gettin' blood from a stone  
We all live by cards that were dealt  
I don't want no promises, don't want no lies  
Go sell them to sombody else  
  
I think it's safe to say, I'm on my own  
It's just another lesson learned  
  
No love lost  
  
(We've had enough, can't take no more)

Revolution
Yngwie Malmsteen
----------------
Now the end begins  
World is dying from within  
Game is still the same  
Different players  
Fuel the flames  
  
Now is the time to shed our skin  
And we must repent our sins  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
Brewing much too long  
New age dawns  
It's a phenomenon  
Calm before the storm  
Our spirits must be free to roam  
  
Out of chaos we will rise  
No time for compromise, no!  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
In this relentless quest  
There's no time to lose  
We must pass the test  
We will wield this power  
To win this battle  
In our finest hour  
  
Then your death will be glorious  
As we stand victorious  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
Revolution  
Revolution

Can You Dig It?
The Monkees
----------------
Some thing doesn't change  
There is only one  
Always changing inside  
What does it become  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
Those who know it use it  
Those who start it die  
To sing that you can dig it  
Is to make your summer fly  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
There is only feeling  
In this world of life and death  
I sing the praise of never change  
With every single breath  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
Hey!...

That Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine
Paul Simon
----------------
In a vine covered  
Shack in the mountains  
Bravely fighting  
The battle of time  
There's a dear one  
Who's wept  
Through life's sorrows  
It's that silver  
Haired daddy of mine  
  
If I could recall  
All the heartaches  
Dear ole daddy  
I've caused you to bear  
If I could erase  
Those lines from your face  
And bring back  
The gold to your hair  
If God would but  
Grant me the power  
Just to turn back  
The pages of time  
I would give all  
I own just to put a tone  
To that silver  
Haired daddy of mine

Love Me Again
Luther Vandross
----------------
What are we saying?  
For what are we praying?  
Using the words we both wanna hear  
  
What are we doing?  
The whole thing is proving  
We're feeling the same way we always did  
  
So, here we go once again  
It's just like back when  
I clearly remember the way we were then  
So come back and love me again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I waited all this time for you  
But, you can't tell love what to do  
It's so hard but it's true  
You used to love me completely  
And I'd really love you to need me  
So darling, tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me, again  
  
I've heard the stories of hearts that get broken  
But, if we take it slowly, it won't have to be  
One step at a time heart, too fast and it all'll fall apart  
I know we're survivors, but I'll speak for me  
  
Even as strong as I am  
I don't think I can  
Lost outside the world  
I don't know just where I stand  
So hurry back girl, and love the boy again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I'd wait a million years for you  
But, you can't tell love where to go  
This is one thing that we know  
You used to love me completely  
And I'd really love you to need me  
So darling, tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me again  
  
Find any way that you can, love me again  
Just think it over and then, love me again

Don't Stop Being Crazy
Helloween
----------------
You're the one I would pick out in a million  
You're the one I would wish for as the friend of my life  
If the whole world decided for a colour  
Would pixels be any different in you  
  
Brave and smart against the rules  
You smile upon the fools  
I follow where you go  
I want you to know  
  
Don't stop being crazy  
Wherever you go  
Don't stop being crazy  
It's a lie  
It's a lie  
It's a lie we could not learn to fly  
Oh no  
Don't stop being crazy  
  
When you walk you walk higher than the others  
When you talk you talk merciless the bothering truth  
Everybody seems remote-controlled nowadays  
Only you have a frequency far beyond their ways  
  
Still and strong you walk alone  
Don't wonder where they're gone  
I'll follow where you go  
I want you to know  
  
Don't stop being crazy  
Wherever you go  
Don't stop being crazy  
It's a lie  
It's a lie  
It's a lie we could not learn to fly  
Oh no  
Don't stop being crazy

Opiated
Tragically Hip
----------------
He bought two-fifths of lead free gasoline  
Said, the bottle is dusty, but my engine is clean  
He bought a nice blue suit with the money he could find  
If his bride didn't like it, St Peter wouldn't mind  
  
Now I lie here so out-of-breath  
And over-opiated  
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no but  
Maybe he could have waited  
  
Well the medicine man started seeing red  
You think the snake just dreams up the poison in his head  
Addicted to approval, addicted to the air  
It was see if you like it or see you up there

(I'm A) Road Runner
James Taylor
----------------
Money, who needs it  
Let me live a life free and easy  
Put a toothbrush in my hand  
Let me be a traveling man  
I'm a roadrunner baby  
  
I'm a road runner baby  
Any place is my home  
I'm a road runner baby  
You look for me and I'll be gone  
  
Well you can love me if you want  
But I do declare  
When I get restless  
I've got to move somewhere  
  
I'm a road runner baby  
Just got to keep on keeping on  
And I love the life I live  
And I'm gonna live the life I love  
  
Don't want no woman  
To tie me down  
Gotta be free baby  
To roam around  
  
All my life it's been like this  
If you love me it's your own risk  
When the dust hits my shoes  
I got the urge to move  
  
I'm a road runner baby  
Anyplace is my home  
And I love the life I live  
And I'm gonna live the life I love  
Roadrunner baby

Justine
Linda Ronstadt
----------------
This is the one about the girl, the girl who came to stay  
Oh but love came down like a hammer and it blew her away  
She's sliding down down down, no place to put her hands  
But she don't think of nothing but the boys in the hot sand no  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Justine  
You know just what this kiss will mean to you  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
I wanted love explained, I had to know what you knew  
But the face of Aphrodite is a blank when it looks at you  
Your heart does its little tricks, your feelings burn right through  
But the cold wire edge of the whip is all that's left of you, oh no  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Justine  
You know just what this kiss will mean to you  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Oh no  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Justine  
You know just what this kiss will mean to you  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do

But You Loved Me Then
Dolly Parton
----------------
Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand  
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land  
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end  
But you loved me then  
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run  
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun  
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind  
But you loved me then  
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand  
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land  
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died  
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again  
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind  
And you no longer care but you love me then  
(And you no longer care) but you love me then  
(And you no longer care) but you love me then

Fight
Leann Rimes
----------------
Hush, Hush why don't you want to talk about it  
Bitch, Bitch you don't need to sugar coat it  
I don't want us to ever get to the point where we can't recover  
Break, Break we're allowed to have our moments  
Go on spell it out there's nothing wrong with being honest  
I can take it, go ahead let it out, lets get it over and done with  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want to fight anymore  
Cause every minute that we fight is a moment that we could be loving  
Lay down with me tonight  
I don't want to fight  
  
We could start a war with both our tempers  
Tomorrow I bet you anything we won't remember  
Who was right, who was wrong, what we said but we'll regret what we've lost  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Were taking for granted how good that we have it  
Lets laugh til' we cry and get back to what matters  
Oh it matters

Anything goes on in your trip  
Did you happen to plan on selling out  
All your fake and original riffs  
Did you happen to think  
That they're true  
And it's all  
That I have  
And I feel  
Like I'm busting  
My ass  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is there anybody?  
(True that it's gone)  
Can't someone stop me?

It's running through my body  
(Finding a sound)  
And we're sitting on it  
(Just get off the ground)  
Can you feel it, honey  
(Coming around)  
Yeah, I've  
Been there before  
  
How did I start off with this gig  
Did I think I would make some money, yeah  
Getting away with all this shit  
Some people might even think  
That it's me  
On the drums  
On the bass  
Filling in  
My guitar  
In your face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there anybody?  
(Taking my time)  
Can't someone stop me?

Can you feel it, honey  
(We're coming around)  
Yeah, I've  
Been there before

My Way
Kanye West
----------------
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday  
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it  
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit  
Yeah I've been broke  
Now I'm good bitch  
I ain't no Kennedy  
But I'm hood rich  
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto  
And everybody else, thank you very little  
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path  
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past  
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last  
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though  
We needed cash  
And we need it fast  
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last  
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white  
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white  
Almost  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Niggaz wanna diss K  
On they're local mix-tapes  
There they go again, lyin' to consumers  
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors  
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya  
A little arrogant with all your compares  
'Cause as far as the Chi  
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap  
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that  
Y'all just talk about my dough  
How I left Chicago  
How I'm the only one eatin'  
Shut your pie hole  
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though  
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro  
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?  
Only difference between you and me, you were gay  
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?  
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways  
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way  
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v  
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway  
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay  
We stay 4 stars, all better  
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather  
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better  
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas  
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial  
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's  
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg  
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg  
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg  
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
I did it my way

Beautiful Soul
Dusty Springfield
----------------
I wonder where you are, lovable lady  
I wonder what you're thinking, beautiful woman  
It seems like fog is settling in within your eyes  
And the weight of something is pulling your shoulders down  
  
Could it be you ask too much, lovable lady?  
From a world that's out of touch, beautiful woman  
So you're hammering at a door that will not open  
And your beautiful soul is weeping  
  
Better learn the way it goes  
Oh, better share the pain that shows  
You wanna transcend it in order to end it  
But your loneliness grows  
  
Ah, ha, do you hate yourself, lovable lady?  
Can I be of help, beautiful woman?  
Your silence is a wall between the two of us  
And my beautiful soul is weeping  
Oooooooooooh

Please don't show your soul to me  
I think I'd see the light shine through  
And please don't greet me on the street  
I'd like to see a world without you  
Please don't change your uniform  
And start to mourn the thousands dead  
And please wear what you've always worn  
And don't be drawn by what I've said  
'cause I've found there's nothing more  
That I could say to you  
Nothing I could do to change your mind  
Change your ways and your tune  
So please don't feel you have to sway  
Or move away from how you feel  
And please say what you mean to say  
And always stay with a heart of steel

I Don't Think We Could Ever Be Friends
Dusty Springfield
----------------
It's the end of our journey  
What can I do?  
Lonely together  
When I'm alone with you  
  
Now that we've come so far  
It seems like the end  
We could be lovers  
We could never be friends  
  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
  
We can never talk  
Like others seem to do  
Lonely together  
Making love to you  
  
We don't get nothing  
From the letters we send  
We could be lovers  
We could never be friends  
  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
  
Plus a new relationship  
You know you break my heart  
What I feel for you's too strong  
It has been from the start  
Every time I see your face  
It's tearing me apart  
What is need is love from you  
Oh, but I can't?  
  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
Ah, ha

I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen
Robbie Williams
----------------
I wouldn't be so alone  
If they knew my name in every home  
Kevin Spacey would call on the phone  
But I'd be too busy  
Come back to the old five and dime  
Cameron Diaz give me a sign  
I make you smile all the time  
and your conversation would complement mine  
  
I will talk and Hollywood will listen  
See them bow my every word  
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing  
Doesn't that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word  
  
Buy up the rights to my book  
And live on a ranch from what the box office took  
I go on visit the set  
They'll call me their savior  
All the people wills come  
Celebrity lives on the moon  
But I'll be back home in June  
To promote 'The sequel'  
  
I will talk and Hollywood will listen  
See them bow my every word  
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing  
Doesn't that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word

10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2)
Tool
----------------
Listen to the tales and romanticize,  
How we follow the path of the hero.  
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun.  
How we rise to the height of our halo.  
  
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,  
Our way into the arms of the savior.  
Fading all the trials and the tribulations,  
None of us have actually been there.  
Not like you.  
  
Ignorant fibbers in the congregation.  
Gather around spewing sympathy.  
Spare me  
None of them can even hold a candle up to you,  
Blinded by choices hypocrites won't see.  
  
But enough about the collective Judas  
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated.  
Your little piece of the divine.  
  
This little light of mine,  
The gift you passed onto me.  
I'll let it shine,  
To guide you safely on your way.  
Your way home.  
  
What are they going to do when the lights go down?  
Without you to guide them all to Zion?  
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun?  
Other than tremble incessantly.  
  
High is the way, but our eyes are upon the ground  
You were the light and the way that they'll only read about.  
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out.  
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough.  
You're going home.  
  
You're the only one who can hold your head up high.  
  
Shake your fist at the gates saying:  
I have come home now.  
Fetch me the spirit.  
The son, and the father.  
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.  
It's time now, my time now.  
Give me my, give me my, wings.  
  
Give me my,  
Give me my wings.  
  
You are the light, a way.  
That they will only read about.  
  
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.  
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers.  
You were my witness.  
My eyes, my evidence.  
Judith Marie, unconditional one.  
  
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.  
Difficult to see you in this light.  
Please forgive this bold suggestion  
Should you see your maker's face tonight.  
Look him in the eye  
Look him in the eye, and tell him.  
I never lived a lie, never took a life.  
But surely saved one, hallelujah.  
It's time for you to bring me home.

Forever In Your Love
Kris Kristofferson
----------------
Lovers make believe in dreams  
Dreamers make believe in makin' love to last forever  
Losers can't believe in anything at all  
Hey-we never meant to fall so hard  
But don't be sorry  
  
Chorus:  
Think of all the love we made us  
Since you used to be afraid of  
Staring at those starry skies above our lives  
And now you're free to  
Be the best that you can be now  
From here to eternity and I'll be here  
Forever in your love  
  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Sometimes lovers even learn to change  
And turn to strangers  
If we never see a single dream come true  
Hey, I still believe in you and me and I'm not sorry.  
  
Chorus:  
Think of all the love we made us  
Since you used to be afraid of  
Staring at those starry skies above our lives  
And now you're free to  
Be the best that you can be now  
From here to eternity and I'll be here  
Forever in your love  
  
Be the best that you can be now  
From here to eternity and I'll be here  
Forever in your love.

Tell Me Why
Unwritten Law
----------------
Hey mister god  
Can you tell me what's wrong  
With my life and all of it's confusions  
Why did she leave me  
With nothing to show  
Except fro a shallow disillusion  
Cause I can't seem to figure why you feel this way  
And I guess I'm to blame  
And if I told you that I didn't care about this place  
Would you think of me the same  
  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Why I can never find the answer to something I will never understand  
Could you please tell me why  
  
I sit back thinking that there once was a time  
A time where everything was perfect  
It seems the things we shared were so far behind  
Behind but we're never getting closer  
Cause I can feel your shadow hanging over me  
And I'm just peering through the light  
And now I realize you never really cared for me  
Will I ever see  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Why I can never find the person  
That I've tried so hard to find  
Could you please tell me why

Cowboy Up
Vince Gill
----------------
I'm puttin' on my favorite cowboy boots  
Like a crazy bull rider comin' out of the chute  
I'm ready for some dancin', maybe too much beer  
Little bare-back rubbin's goin' on in here  
Hey little cowgirl, leave the Stetson on  
Let's cowboy up and down, honey, all night long  
She said her name was Levitra Marcantonio  
I'm a bare back rider, okie, don't you know?  
These frozen margaritas are goin' to my head  
I could not believe it when Levitra said  
?Hey Mr. Cowboy, come on and take me home  
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long?  
All night long, oh, you're comin' on strong  
All night long, come on and do me wrong, do me wrong, baby  
Hey little cowgirl, leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long  
Hey little cowgirl, leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down till Levitra's gone

No Lonesome Tune
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
I ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune  
Ah, babe, I'm a-commin' soon  
I cannot believe I stayed so long away  
But a man must look around  
And you're the sweetest thing I've found  
Your lost high roller's rollin' home today  
  
My daddy said to me  
"Son, it's hard as you will see  
To find someone upon whom to rely"  
In the kitchen mama sneezed  
And he grinned big as you please  
Said "bless you" and a tear come to his eye  
  
I did decide that very day  
That I would like to live that way  
And now I know I just been wastin' time  
It's with you that I should be  
If you feel the same 'bout me  
I'm headed home along the straightest line

Don't Cry Daddy
Elvis Presley
----------------
Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing in my head,  
My pillow still wet  
From last night's tears  
As I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Kept crying out  
Ringing in my ears  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cry, daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy  
And together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy, ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy  
Please  
Don't cry  
  
Why are children always first  
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst  
It's true but somehow  
It just don't seem right  
'Cause every time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so I wonder  
Will it be the same tonight  
  
[Chorus:x2]  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

Conversation On A Barstool
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand,  
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight.  
It's taken everything I had to give  
And now I just want to get out of here.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for forty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
He came from Miami to start out again.  
To leave him was easy, I did it all the time.  
He said that he loved me and he wanted a child,  
If he opened his mouth, he was telling you lies.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for thirty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
I was an actress, a girl in the Chorus  
On Broadway I danced for a Kennedy.  
They know me in London and they know me in Paris,  
I'm only talkin' 'cause you looked like you needed a friend.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for twenty-five dollars I'm half-way  
To Miami.

Just Between You And Me
Foreigner
----------------
Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Don't act surprised  
If the word gets out, yeah, that's alright  
  
I know you're just looking for some sympathy  
but listen you don't know how it gets back to me  
You're getting reckless girl, but that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then we'll have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
we'll be all alone in a different light  
I don't care what the world can't see  
It's just between you and me  
  
I see telltale signs of a love in decline  
There should be something to say  
but we don't take the time  
and I don't understand, but that's alright  
  
Now you can turn the page or you can tear me apart  
Don't make an open book out of my private heart  
You should know better now, but that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then we'll have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
we'll be all alone in a different light  
I don't care what the world can't see  
It's just between you and me  
  
If we don't work this out we won't recover  
We'll loose this soulfful love for one another  
But with all I've heard and all I've seen  
I'm still lost in your mystery  
  
Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Don't act surprised if the word gets out  
Yeah that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another

A Stranger In My Place
Kenny Rogers
----------------
I see the town  
Where we were born,  
I see the place  
We were raised,  
  
I see all the things you wanted  
That I never gave.  
I see sadness,  
I see sorrow,  
  
I see pain in your face,  
But I just can't see  
A stranger in my place.  
  
I can see now where we quarrelled,  
I can see now I was wrong,  
I can see where you might weaken  
  
When I wasn't strong.  
I see memories of a love gone bad  
That time cannot erase,  
But I just can't see a stranger in my place.  
  
No one seems to know you quite like I do,  
No one knows the thigs that make you cry.  
Looking back it seems  
I never showed you,  
  
And now I lay alone and wonder why.  
I can see now  
Where you might grow tired of dreams  
That don't come true,  
  
I can see where I have fallen short  
Of the things I promised you.  
I can see mow through my tear filled eyes no love on your face,  
I must get used to seein' strangers in my place.

I Surrender, Dear
Madonna
----------------
(Madonna:)  
Pride's that splendid liar  
Sworn enemy of love  
  
(Jennifer:)  
Kept my lips from saying  
Things my heart was thinking of  
  
(Madonna:)  
But now my pride you've humbled  
I've cast it to the winds  
  
(Jennifer:)  
Broken, beaten, sick at heart  
  
(Both:)  
Our compassion begins  
  
(Madonna:)  
We played the game of 'stay away'  
But it costs more than I can pay  
Without you I can't make my way  
I surrender dear  
  
(Jennifer:)  
I may seem proud, I may act gay  
It's just a pose, I'm not that way  
'Cause deep down in my heart I say  
I surrender dear  
  
(Madonna:)  
Little mean things we were doing  
Must have been part of the game  
Lending a spice to the wooing  
  
(Both:)  
But I don't care who's to blame  
  
(Madonna:)  
When stars appear  
(Jennifer:)  
When stars appear  
(Madonna:)  
And shadows fall  
(Jennifer:)  
And shadows fall  
(Madonna:)  
Why then you'll hear  
(Jennifer:)  
Why then you'll hear  
(Both:)  
My poor heart call  
To you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender dear

It's In Every One Of Us
Cliff Richard
----------------
It's in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by  
It's in every one of us  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by  
It's in every one of us  
I just remembered  
It's like I've been sleeping for years  
I'm not awake as I can be  
But my seeing's better  
I can see through the tears  
I've been realizing that  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show  
But there's scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands  
Who all know what I know  
And it's good that it's so  
It's in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by  
It's in every one of us by and by

I Know You, I Live You
Chaka Khan
----------------
It's not difficult  
For me to say I love you  
It wouldn't be difficult  
If you would say the same  
And believe me when I tell you  
That I know you very well  
I know you like I know my name  
I think that I have met you  
Somewhere in my dreams  
I may never have met you at all  
And I know you must be thinking,  
"What a silly girl"  
I know your every thought and scheme  
I wake up to the feeling each morning  
I go to bed to it at night  
I know you, I live you  
CHORUS:  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I know you as if I've known you all my life  
I know you, I live you  
One day you'll realize  
That we're not strangers  
If you open up your eyes  
You'll know me too  
And see that we were  
Meant to be together, my dear  
And all the rest is up to you  
BRIDGE  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I know you as if I've known you all my life  
I know you, I know you  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I think I know you more than you know yourself  
I know you, I live you  
Know you, live you  
Know you, live you  
Know you  
And without me you'd stumble  
And without you I'd fall  
Without each other we would not be at all

Overkill V...The Brand
Overkill
----------------
Ride the wind son  
Through my eyes  
You'll see where you must stand  
  
Remember what your purpose is  
And that you were the brand  
  
Awaken in me if you can  
The deaths by one's own hand  
Remember where you came from  
And that you wear the brand...  
You wear the brand  
  
Blatant, born in fire  
With little more to say  
Than action speaks the loudest  
And yield the only way  
To quench the thirst,  
Desire, swifter than the hand  
In bloody fascination  
His pride to wear the brand  
  
Bend and twist and tear the will  
Show them where you've been  
A tribute to your Overkill  
A multitude of sin  
  
Away-away no time to stay  
The union it still stands  
Willingness, donation  
We all display, the brand

Do you do you do you do you want to dance

Squeeze me baby all through the night  
Oh baby, do you want to dance?

Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?  
Squeeze me baby all through the night  
Oh baby, do you want to dance

Rain guzaari, taare gin, gin

Gheer ke phir naa barase  
Pyaas daba kar dil hi dil men  
Kitana tadape, tarse  
Dard hamaara dil jaane, ya  
Dard hamaara dil jaane, ya

No Remorse
Metallica
----------------
No mercy for what we are doing  
No thought to even what we have done  
We don't need to feel the sorrow  
No remorse for the helpless one  
  
War without end  
No remorse, no repent  
We don't care what it meant  
Another day, another death  
Another sorrow, another breath  
No remorse, no repent  
We don't care what it meant  
Another day,another death  
Another sorrow, another breath  
  
Blood feeds the war machine  
As it eats its way across the land  
We don't need the feel the sorrow  
No remorse is the one command  
  
War without end  
No remorse, no repent  
We don't care what it meant  
Another day, another death  
Another sorrow, another breath  
No remorse, no repent  
We don't care what it meant  
Another day, another death  
Another sorrow, another breath  
  
Only the strong survive  
No one to save the weaker race  
We are ready to kill all comers  
Like a loaded gun right at your face  
  
War without end  
No remorse, no repent  
We don't care what it meant  
Another day, another death  
Another sorrow, another breath  
No remorse, no repent  
We don't care what it meant  
Another day, another death  
Another sorrow Another breath  
  
Attack  
Bullets are flying  
People are dying  
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose  
Soldiers are hounding  
Bodies are mounting  
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse  
With war machines going  
Blood starts to flowing  
No mercy given to anyone hear  
The furious fighting  
Swords are like lighting  
It all becomes frightening to you  
Know death is near  
No remorse

No Stoppin' Us Now
Randy Travis
----------------
(Chorus)  
There's no stoppin' us now  
We've gone all the way  
There's no slowin' down  
This love fits us so right  
There's no holdin' back  
And there's no end in sight  
You and I have found  
What few will ever find  
And we started so young  
Even time's on our side  
  
[Chorus]  
It's hard to believe  
That I really got by without you  
So now every hour seems empty  
When I'm not beside you  
[Chorus]

Natural Disaster
Zac Brown Band
----------------
Had lips like candy  
Hair flowing like water  
Skin like velvet made  
The whole damn world slow down  
She was a preacher's daughter  
Never did what daddy taught her  
And the rebel in her soul  
Brought her to me  
  
The river was cold  
And the river was wide  
She flowed from the mountain  
Straight across the great divide  
And her heart ran cold  
But her love runs deep  
She's fire on the mountain  
Wrecking everyone she meets  
  
She's like rain when she rolls in  
But that sunshine in her thunder  
Makes the loneliest heart wonder  
If the ride is worth the pain  
Might not be stone clouds inside  
Oh but don't you worry friend  
She's coming around the bend  
She's holding lightning in both hands  
  
Lord please know  
It's that time for me to go  
The river has my heart  
She's the keeper of my soul  
On one side of the water  
Sweet everlasting grace  
The other side could end your life  
Or steal your breath away  
  
She's like rain when she rolls in  
But that sunshine in her thunder  
Makes the loneliest heart wonder  
If the ride is worth the pain  
Might not be stone clouds inside  
Oh but don't you worry friend  
She's coming around the bend  
She's holding lightning in both hands  
  
She's a natural disaster  
She'll tear the land in two  
She's running to be running  
'Cause it's all she knows to do  
She's a tumbleweed rolling  
A river running wild  
A hurricane blowing  
She's the calm after the storm  
Under an Appalachian sunset sky  
  
She's like rain when she rolls in  
But that sunshine in her thunder  
Makes the loneliest heart wonder  
If the ride is worth the pain  
Might not be stone clouds inside  
Oh but don't you worry friend  
She's coming around the bend  
She's holding lightning in both hands  
  
She's like rain  
She's rolls in  
But there's sunshine in her thunder  
She's coming around the bend  
She's holding lightning in both hands

There Will Never Be Another
Amy Grant
----------------
There will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
And I know that there will never be another love  
Who could ever be the love that You are  
'Cause You had so much to lose  
But still You gave it up for Your scars  
But that's the way You are  
And if I spent my life attending Universities  
Educated in the wisdom of men  
And if I could even quote a guy like Socrates  
Even then I couldn't comprehend  
That there will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
And I know I'll never understand the mystery  
If I live to be a hundred and three  
How You died to live the love You give to me  
There will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
There will never be another  
Who has loved me like You

Leavin' On Your Mind
Leann Rimes
----------------
If you've got leavin' on your mind  
Tell me now, get it over  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If you've got leavin' on your mind  
  
If there's a new love in your heart  
Well, tell me now, get it over  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If there's a new love in your heart  
  
Don't leave me here  
In a world filled with dreams that might have been  
Hurt me now, get it over  
I may learn to love again  
  
If there's a new love in your heart  
Well, tell me now, get it over  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If there's a new love in your heart  
  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If there's a new love in your heart

Poor Fool
Tina Turner
----------------
I want to tell all of you  
That ain't doin' nothin' for me  
And can't do nothin' for me  
You should tend to your business  
And leave mine alone  
Because as far as this man is concerned....  
  
I wanna tell you he's mine  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now let me tell ya he's mine!  
(Wake up and be strong)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(We know how you will feel)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah he's mine  
(But is his love for real?)  
  
I'm gonna shine  
(Oh yeah?)  
'Cause he's my man  
(Says who?)  
And he's mine  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now listen!  
  
This man of mine is my every thought  
I'd give him Russia if it could be bought  
I'm not ashamed of nothing I do  
I'd guide a missile if he told me to  
'Cause he's mine!  
(Poor Fool!)  
I know he's mine!  
(Says who?)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
  
If I make my bed hard  
That's where I'm gonna sleep  
You people talking means nothing to me  
I work my fingers right down to the bone  
Do anything to please him, right or wrong  
  
'Cause he's mine!  
(Oh no)  
I know he's mine!  
(Oh yeah)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Oh he's mine!  
(Oh no)  
I know he's mine!  
(Oh yeah)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now listen!  
  
I'm with my man in every way  
To keep him happy each and every day  
I'll never hurt him or make him frown  
I'm with my man if he's up or down

Fool For Your Loving
Whitesnake
----------------
I was born under a bad sign, left out in the cold  
I'm a lonely man who knows just what it means to lose control  
But I took all the heartache and turned it to shame  
Now I'm movin', movin' on and I ain't taking the blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't come running to me, I know I've done all I can  
A hard loving woman like you just makes a hard loving man  
So I can say it to you, babe: I'll be a fool for your loving no more  
A fool for your loving no more  
I'm so tired of trying, I always end up crying  
A fool for your loving no more, I'll be a fool for your loving no more  
  
I'm tired of hiding my feelings, you left me lonely too long  
I gave my heart and you tore it apart  
Oh, baby you done me wrong  
  
[Chorus]

Charlene
Modern Talking
----------------
You were mend for me  
I'll give you love and ecstasy  
Strangers on the shore  
I want to play this game no more  
But if you run with me  
Babe, to eternity  
Baby, I'm born again  
Broken hearts can mend, tonight  
  
My Charlene, Charlene, Charlene  
I'm lonely, you're the only  
Queen of hearts  
My Charlene, Charlene, Charlene  
I'm falling  
Oh, I'm calling  
For your love, for your love  
  
My Charlene  
You are like the flame of love  
Sole survivor of my lost emotion  
My Charlene, I never get enough  
How my love is deeper than an ocean  
Daytime friends and nighttime love  
  
If my heart could speak  
You hear I'm lonely and I'm weak  
There must be a way  
I love you more than words can say  
And if you run with me  
You can have my love for free  
Come on the wings of love  
Up in the sky above, tonight

Endless Sleep
Judds
----------------
The night was dark, rain fallin' down.  
Look for my baby, he's nowhere around.  
I traced his footsteps down to the shore,  
Afraid he's gone forever more.  
  
[Chorus]  
I looked at the sea, and it seemed to say,  
"I took your baby from you, away."  
I heard a voice, cryin' in the deep,  
"Come join your baby in my endless sleep."  
  
Why did we quarrel? Why did we fight?  
Why did I leave him alone tonight?  
That's why his footsteps ran to the sea.  
That's why my baby is gone from me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ran in the water, heart full of fear.  
There, in the breakers, I saw him near.  
Reached for my baby, held him to me,  
Stole him away from the endless sleep.  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,  
"You took your baby from me, away."  
My heart cried out, "He's mine to keep!"  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.

I Will Always Love You
Whitney Houston
----------------
If I should stay, I'll only be in your way  
So I'll go, but I know I'll  
Think of you every step of the way  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
You, my darling you, hmmm,  
  
Bittersweet memories  
That is all I'm taking with me  
So, goodbye  
Please, don't cry  
We both know I'm not what you, you need  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish to you, joy and happiness  
But above all this, I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I, I will always love you  
  
You, darling, I love you  
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you

Big Dipper
Elton John
----------------
Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor  
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure  
He had a thing about a quarter to four  
And he just couldn't handle any more  
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper  
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours  
  
So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him  
And you took him down to the fairground after some action  
And by around about a quarter to six  
You found a different way to get your kicks  
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks  
Big dipper  
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks  
  
He hadn't been too keen at the start  
Now he seems to have a change of heart  
He's got his own big dipper  
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper  
He's got his own big dipper  
But there's always room for more  
  
Everybody's got a song to sing  
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper  
  
And at around about a quarter to ten  
You got up and did it all again  
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for  
Big dipper  
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours  
  
Another ride, another tune  
Another crazy afternoon  
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper

Say (All I Need)
OneRepublic
----------------
Do you know where your heart is?  
Do you think you can find it?  
Or did you trade it for something  
Somewhere better just to have it?  
  
Do you know where your love is?  
Do you think that you lost it?  
You felt it so strong, but  
Nothing's turned out how you wanted  
  
Well, bless my soul  
You're a lonely soul  
Cause you won't let go  
Of anything you hold  
  
Well, all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
Do you know what your fate is?  
And are you trying to shake it?  
You're doing your best and your best look  
You're praying that you make it  
  
Well, bless my soul  
You're a lonely soul  
'Cause you won't let go  
Of anything you hold  
  
Well, all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
I said all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
Do you think you can find it?  
Do you think you can find it?  
Do you think you can find it?  
Better than you had it  
  
Do you think you can find it?  
Do you think you can find it?  
Do you think you can find it?  
Yeah, better than you had it  
Better than you had it  
  
I said I all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
I said all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
Whenever the end is  
Do you think you can see it?  
Well, until you get there  
Go on, go ahead and scream it  
Just say it

Make Me Proud
Drake
----------------
I like a woman with a future and a past  
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last  
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast  
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that  
Only you can do it just like that  
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower  
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and you'll always be the one  
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl  
Maybe it's just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl  
They want you in their life as a wife  
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest  
Why you want to fight for your right  
'Cause you don't love them boys  
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise  
  
[Chorus]  
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go  
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?  
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine  
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time  
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you  
  
B-b-b-b-bet I am  
All of them bitches I'm badder than  
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in  
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'  
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say  
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'  
I'm a star, sheriff badge  
What's the point if I'm guarding?  
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

A Beautiful Life
Religious Music
----------------
Each day I'll do a golden deed  
By helping those who are in need  
My life on earth is but a span  
And so I'll do the best I can.  
  
Refrain:  
Life's evening sun is sinking low  
A few more days, and I must go  
To meet the deeds that I have done  
Where there will be no setting sun.  
  
To be a child of God each day  
My light must shine along the way  
I'll sing His praise while ages roll  
And strive to help some troubled soul.  
  
The only life that will endure  
Is one that's kind and good and pure  
And so for God I'll take my stand  
Each day I'll lend a helping hand.  
  
I'll help someone in time of need  
And journey on with rapid speed  
I'll help the sick and poor and weak  
And words of kindness to them speak.  
  
While going down life's weary road  
I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load  
I'll try to turn the night to day  
Make flowers bloom along the way.

Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Hovering over me at night  
Mama  
Comfort me, make me feel all right  
I walk alone and see what boys should never  
See in their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Come and take, come and take my hand  
Mama  
Try and see, try to understand  
Mama  
Looking through, looking through my eyes  
Mama  
Everywhere, always in disguise  
I walk alone and see what boys should never  
See in their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
I walk alone and see what boys should never see  
I hear what boys should never hear  
In their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Please be good . . .

Going For The One
Yes
----------------
Get the idea cross around the track  
Underneath the flank of thoroughbred racing chasers.  
Getting the feel as a river flows.  
Would you like to go 'n shoot the mountain masses?  
And here you stand no taller than the grass sees.  
And should you really chase so hard.  
The truth of sport plays rings around you.  
  
Going for the one  
Going for the one  
  
Get in the way as the tons of water  
Racing with you crashing through the rudder.  
Once at the start you can gamble  
That you really surely really mean to finish.  
After seeing all your sense of fear diminish.  
As you treat danger a pure collection.  
As you throw away misconceptions.  
Going for the one.  
Going for the one.  
Going for a  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touch time  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high.  
Roundabout, sounding out, love you so  
Love you so  
Love you so  
  
Now the verses I've sang  
Don't add much weight to the story in my head  
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line.  
But they're so hard to find  
In my cosmic mind  
So I think I'll take a look out of the window.  
When I think about you  
I don't feel low.  
N'should I really chase so hard.  
The truth of sport plays rings around you.  
Going for the one.  
Going for the one.  
Going for to  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touch time  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high  
Taking your time  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one  
Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touchtime  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high  
Taking your time  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one  
Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one  
Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
  
Moments decide.  
Moments delight.  
Moments in flight.  
Talk about sending love.

Oh yeah  
Baby, baby, baby, I want to stew your tomato  
Baby, baby, baby, I want to french fry your potato  
Baby, baby, baby, won't you pluck my grapes  
Won't you peel my banana like a pack of wild apes?

You'll miss my carrot cake  
And my cream of mushroom  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, my jalapeno's red hot  
Baby, baby, baby, I want to stuff all that cabbage you got  
I'm your food innuendo guy, food innuendo guy  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, you got eggplant parmigiana  
Baby, baby, baby, bite my zucchini if you want to  
I'll give you fresh fruit salad

I'm your cucumber man  
I'm your food innuendo guy, food innuendo guy  
Oh so delicious

Walk Like A Panther
Pretenders
----------------
Miguel has set up home  
With a woman half my age  
A half-wit in a leotard  
Stands on my stage  
  
The standards have fallen  
My value has dropped  
But don't shed a tear  
Some walk like they own the place  
Whilst others creep in fear  
  
Try if you can  
To walk like a man  
But if you don't come near  
You've got to fly like an eagle  
Prowl like a lion in Africa  
Leap like a salmon home from the sea  
To keep up with me  
You've got to walk like a panther tonight  
  
The old home town just looks the same  
Like a derelict man who has died out of shame  
Like a jumble sale left out in the rain  
It's not good  
It's not right  
  
The standards have fallen  
My value has dropped  
But don't shed a tear  
Some walk like they own the place  
Whilst others creep in fear  
  
Try if you can  
To walk like a man  
But if you don't come near  
You've got to fly like an eagle  
Prowl like a lion in Africa  
Leap like a salmon home from the sea  
To keep up with me  
You've got to walk like a panther tonight  
  
Where did you leave your self respect  
You like look like a reptile  
Your house is a wreck  
Your existence an insult  
And stains that are suspect  
Cover your clothes  
  
The standards have fallen  
My value has dropped  
But don't shed a tear  
Some walk like they own the place  
Whilst others creep in fear  
  
Try if you can  
To walk like a man  
But if you don't come near  
You've got to fly like an eagle  
Prowl like a lion in Africa  
Leap like a salmon home from the sea  
To keep up with me  
You've got to walk like a panther tonight  
Walk like a panther tonight  
To keep up with me you've go

The son of man

The world reconciled

Dead Body Man
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
"This is a Channel 7 news brief because the news is happening now!  
Good evening Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight: Police and  
investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody stole four
dead bodies from the  
Wayne County morgue late Monday night. Police say the apparent body thief
entered  
through the basement window but how they eluded the security and alarm system
is still a  
mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering: What kinda sick FUCK would
steal four  
dead bodies anyway? Details at 11."  
  
Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street.  
55-65, bodies at least.  
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn.  
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn.  
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven.  
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'.  
Tastes like chicken, finger lickin' deep fried.  
I ate a dead body, but don't tell. I lied.  
I just ate my first dead body last week,  
Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth.  
Before ya start yellin' and cursin' my name,  
Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane.  
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall.  
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall.  
I'm sliding and I'm boucin' off shit like a hockey puck.  
And my mother's like, "What the fuck?!"  
He said I was born of an alien race.  
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face.  
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand.  
I'm just a dead body man.  
  
"We've got bodies! Dead bodies! We got fat ones, skinny ones, males, females,  
hermaphrodites! We got somebodies! We got nobodies! Bodies, bodies, bodies!  
WOO!"  
  
Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van.  
All the little kiddies love the dead body man.  
I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell.  
Some people run cause they don't like the smell.  
Others line up just as quick as they can.  
To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man.  
It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh.....  
Just don't look in the trunk.  
I drive down central kickin' the bass.  
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face.  
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head.  
Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead.  
I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut.  
A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut.  
Riding in the back is my dead body crew.  
Only they can never think of nothin' to do.  
If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself.  
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf.  
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand.  
I'm just the dead body man.  
  
"We also collect dead bodies! So if you know any dead people,  
or you yourself are planning on dying soon,  
we'll be happy to come to your house and pay cash for it!  
We appreciate good, healthy, stiffs for our dinner! WAHOO!"  
  
Call me the dead body man (Some'll give 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (Just sell 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (You can mail 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (But, Bring 'em to me!)  
  
Call me the dead body man (Won't ya give 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (You can sell 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (Just mail 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (But, Bring 'em to me!)  
  
Call me the dead body man (Won't ya give 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (You can sell 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (Just mail 'em to me!)  
Call me the dead body man (But, Bring 'em to me!)  
  
Call me the dead body man.  
Call me the dead body man

Think Twice
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
Ooh  
Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong  
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long  
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light  
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight  
This is getting serious  
Are you thinking 'bout you or us  
  
(Chorus)  
Don't say what you're about to say  
Look back before you leave my life  
Be sure before you close that door  
Before you roll those dice  
Baby think twice  
  
Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory  
For the fire and the faith that was you and me  
Babe I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground  
Cos when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down  
But baby this is serious  
Are you thinking 'bout you or us  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
(Breakdown)  
Baby this is serious  
Are you thinking 'bout you or us  
  
Don't say what you're about to say  
Look back before you leave my life  
Be sure before you close that door  
Before you roll those dice  
  
Don't do what you're about to do  
My everything depends on you  
And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice  
Before you roll those dice  
Baby think twice

Hold You Back
Status Quo
----------------
How d'you know the music when you don't know the score  
Do you think that you can make it when you don't need no more  
Is it really the reason when it is not a need  
Are you trying hard to write it before you can read  
  
Hold you back, hold you back, and slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Slow you down, you've gotta try  
  
Does the clock that you're watching ever tell you 'bout the time  
Does the song that you're singing sound to you like a rhyme  
Will there be an answer when you stop asking why  
All because of the jigsaw that makes up a lie  
  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Slow you down, you've gotta try  
  
How d'you know the music when you don't know the score  
Do you think that you can make it when you don't need no more  
Is it really the reason when it is not a need  
Are you trying hard to write it before you can read  
  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Slow you down, you've gotta try  
  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down

She Goes All The Way
Rascal Flatts
----------------
No limits, no lines are drawn  
The whole world disappears when  
We're alone  
That thin white cotton dress is  
Blowin' in the wind  
She takes my hand and the dance begins  
  
[Chorus]  
With every move she makes  
I'm deeper than I've been  
Holding on and letting go  
She just keeps givin' in  
Takin' me higher and further  
There she goes again givin' more than  
She takes  
'Cause it's more than love she makes  
She goes all the way  
  
No questions, no talking at all  
Only the sound of our hearts as the fall  
No matter what I need, her answer's  
Always yes  
I only have to dream and she does the  
Rest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
My baby goes all the way, the way  
She goes all the way  
My baby goes all the way  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

O Little Town Of Bethlehem
Mariah Carey
----------------
Oh, little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless  
Sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all  
The years are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep  
The angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
Oh, morning stars together  
Proclaim the Holy birth  
And praises sing  
To God the King  
And peace to men on Earth  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls  
Will receive him still  
The dear Christ enters in  
  
Oh, holy child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
We hear the christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emanuel

Pan Blue
Yello

I know I never knew till now what love and life were all about  
I never could at any time forget the day that you were mine  
Another day, another night, I'm lost again, blue morning light  
I never could at any time forget the day that you were mine  
  
I want the ocean  
I want emotion  
I want your eyes, and oh your lullabys  
  
He's out there  
He's out there  
Feel good  
Feel good  
Feel good  
  
I want the ocean  
I want emotion  
I want your eyes, and oh your lullabys  
I want the ocean  
I want the ocean

Black Again
Stone Temple Pilots
----------------
When you're fed up and lonely  
And nothing else seems to matter really  
  
I'll be here waiting for the  
Black cloud to leave you  
I'll be here to hold your hand  
When you're tired and lonely  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She can't eat  
She can't sleep  
She's not well (she's lonely again)  
She can't breathe  
She's in bed  
She's in hell  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her  
  
Hold your breath underwater  
And know you'll rise to the surface slowly  
  
Think of me as a ship that might hold you  
Carry you to the shore  
When you're tired and lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her

Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet  
Screamer, dreamer, disarray  
Gypsy, gypsy, why don't you fly away?

When your daddy come home with an old soup bone  
And take all your money away  
And your mama's in the kitchen on the phone she be bitchin'  
And your girlfriend who called to say

Over And Over
Black Sabbath
----------------
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn  
And sometimes I'm warm as fire  
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain  
And it goes over, and over, and over again, yeah  
  
Too many flames, with too much to burn  
And life's only made of paper  
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain  
But it goes over, and over, and over, and over again  
  
Yeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone  
And for their dreams that will all be ashes  
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain  
And it goes over, and over, and over, and over again  
  
(Over)  
(Over)

Lucky One
Alison Krauss
----------------
You're the lucky one so I've been told  
As free as the wind blowing down the road  
Loved by many, hated by none  
I'd say you were lucky 'cause  
You know what you've done  
Not a care in the world, not a worry in sight  
Everything is gonna be alright 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
You're the lucky one always having fun  
A jack of all trades, a master of none  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why, when, where or how  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why when where or how  
No matter where you're at it's where you'll be  
You can bet you're luck won't follow me  
Just give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one

Magic Dance
David Bowie

You remind me of the babe.  
(What babe?)  
The babe with the power.  
(What power?)  
The Power of voodoo.  
(Who do?)  
You do.  
(Do what?)  
Remind me of the babe.  
  
I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry  
What could I do?  
My baby's love had gone  
And left my baby blue  
Nobody knew  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dog tails?  
Thunder or lightning  
Then baby said  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Put that baby's spell on me  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Put that magic jump on me  
Slap that baby, make him free!  
  
I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try  
What could I do?  
My baby's fun had gone  
And left my baby blue  
Nobody knew  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dogs tails  
Thunder or lightning  
Then baby said:  
  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) (x4)  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) (x2)  
  
Put that baby's spell on me (ooh)  
  
You remind me of the babe  
(What babe?)  
The babe with the power.  
(What power?)  
The power of voodoo.  
(Who do?)  
You do.  
(Do what?)  
Remind me of the babe  
  
Dance magic, dance, ooh ooh ooh  
Dance magic, dance magic, ooh ooh ooh  
Dance magic  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dog tails  
Thunder or lightning  
Something frightening  
  
Dance magic, dance  
Dance magic, dance  
Put that baby's spell on me  
Jump magic, jump  
Jump magic, jump  
Put that magic jump on me  
Slap that baby make him free

You Made Me Love You (Dear Mr. Gable)
Judy Garland
----------------
Dear Mr Gable  
I am writing this to you  
And I hope that you  
Will read it so you'll know  
  
My heart beats like a hammer  
And I stutter and I stammer  
Every time I see you at the picture show  
I guess I'm just another fan of yours  
And I thought I'd write and tell you so  
  
You made me love you  
I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it  
You made me love you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it  
  
You made me happy  
Sometimes you made me glad  
But there were times, sir  
You made me feel so sad  
  
You made me sigh 'cause  
I didn't wanna tell you  
I didn't wanna tell you  
I think you're grand, that's true  
Yes I do, 'deed I do, you know I do  
  
I must tell you what I'm feeling  
The very mention of your name  
Sends my heart reeling  
You know you made me love you  
  
Aw, gee, Mr Gable  
I don't wanna bother you  
Guess, guess you got a lotta girls  
That tell you the same thing  
  
And if you don't wanna read this  
Well, you don't have to  
But I just had to tell you about the time  
I saw you in, "It Happened One Night"  
  
That was the first time I ever saw you  
And I knew right then  
You were the nicest fella in the movies  
I guess it was 'cause you acted so  
Well, so natural like  
  
Not like a real actor at all  
But just like any fella you'd meet  
At school or at a party  
Then one time I saw you in a picture  
With Joan Crawford  
  
And I had to cry a little  
'Cause you loved her so much  
And you couldn't have her  
Not 'til the end of the picture, anyway  
  
And then one time I saw you in person  
You going to the Coconut Grove  
One night and I was standing there  
When you got out of your car  
  
And you almost knocked me down  
Oh, but it wasn't your fault  
I was in the way  
But you looked at me and you smiled  
  
Yeah, you smiled right at me  
As if you meant it  
And I cried all the way home  
Just 'cause you smiled at me  
For being in your way  
Aw, I'll never forget it, Mr Gable  
Honest angel, you're my favorite actor  
  
I don't care what happens  
Let the whole world stop  
As far as I'm concerned  
You'll always be the top  
'Cause you know  
You made me love you

Give It Away
George Strait
----------------
She was stormin' through the house that day  
And I could tell she was leavin'  
And I thought, 'aw, she'll be back.'  
Until we turned around and pointed at the wall and said  
  
That picture from out honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
Just give it away  
She said give it away  
  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where so much love was made  
Just give it away  
She said just give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give it away  
There ain't nothing in this house worth fightin' over  
Oh, we're both tired of fightin' anyway  
Just give it away  
  
Oh, I tried to move on  
But I found that each woman I held  
Just reminded me of that day  
  
When that front door swung wide open  
She flung her diamond ring  
Said, give it away  
Just give it away  
  
And I said, now honey  
Don't you even want your half of everything  
She said give it away  
Just give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So, I'm still right here where she left me  
Along with all the other things that she don't care about anymore  
Hmm  
  
Like that picture from our honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where all our love was made  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
  
I've got furnished house  
A diamond ring  
And a lonely, broken heart  
Full of love  
And I can't even give it away

Starlight
Zed
----------------
It's alright  
It's Ok  
I'll keep holding on today  
'Cause I'm waiting for the starlight in your eyes  
  
No more faith  
No more hope  
All that I can do is grope  
For a shred of loving care from my girl  
  
The pain you felt has burdened you  
You can't feel loved  
I'm glad that I have been with you  
But that's not enough  
  
In your arms I would be  
Overjoyed as any boy  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much  
  
Feel your touch every night  
When I dreamed to be alright  
There you are in front of me  
With your smile  
  
The pain you felt has burdened you  
You can't feel loved  
I'm glad that I have been with you  
But that's not enough  
Whoa, that's not enough  
  
The pain you felt has burdened you  
You can't feel loved  
I'm glad that I have been with you  
But that's not enough  
Whoa, that's not enough  
  
In your arms I would be  
Overjoyed as any boy  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much  
  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much  
  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much

Fighting Man
Ufo
----------------
Hearts of darkness  
Falling down,  
It's raining stones  
Fate is driving  
Now there's no meat  
On the bone  
There's a hurricane coming,  
What a bitter pill  
There's a distant drumming,  
Coming over the hill  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
  
Cold Wild Turkey  
Drives a spike right through my brain  
Bar room mothers  
Waiting for the gravy train  
  
It's a cold wind a blowing,  
Gone out of control  
Time is a running,  
Touching my very soul  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
  
Solo  
  
Ashes to ashes  
Trash is still trash  
It's only a moment now  
And we're gone in a flash  
  
Silver lining  
Where's the man  
With the master plan  
Hearts of darkness  
Spreading out  
All across this land  
  
There's a hurricane a'coming,  
What a bitter pill  
There's a distant drumming,  
Coming over the hill  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
Just a common man  
Just a common man

Hot Night In A Cold Town
Uriah Heep
----------------
Sonny's out strolling, ambling slowly, washed in  
Amber street lights, a Mexican wind blows in  
Takin' a hold of Angelina's hair and her halo  
Motors running, muffling the sound of the street talk  
  
A big deal's goin' down in another hot night  
In a cold town, got yourself a hot night in a cold town  
  
Johnny's got spare change in his pocket, a ring and a watch  
To hock for a sweet ride, a one way ticket hidden in his shoe  
These last few hours he says, he'll spend with you  
He's leavin' home without a trace, no forwarding address  
  
He'll never have to face another hot night in a cold town  
Got yourself a hot night in a cold town  
  
Well, the losers and the groovers  
And the corner boys are hangin' around  
Runnin' in and out of doorways, up and down  
The stairways, stray dogs headed for the pound  
  
In another hot night in a cold town, got you  
Got yourself a hot night in a cold, cold town, cold town  
It's just another hot night in a cold town  
Such a cold town

Little Johnny Hooker
Grand Funk Railroad
----------------
Oh, I'm gonna tell you a story 'bout a little boy.  
Oh, a sad little boy.  
I'm talkin' 'bout little johnny hooker.  
  
Little johnny hooker was a sissy on the street all his life --  
All his natural born life.  
Until his daddy took him aside and said,  
"son, now here's your switchblade knife boy."  
  
He said "get out in the street boy,  
Cut yourself some meat boy.  
Get out on your own side of the road,  
And lighten my load."  
  
Johnny made a mistake and took his knife down to school one day.  
Hey, yeah, yeah.  
And, when the bell rang for lunch.  
Freddie miller went and got in johnny's way boy.  
He took his knife from his pocket, pushed a button on the side.  
When he seen the queen steel,  
You ought to seen the light in freddy's eyes.  
  
Oh, yeah ...  
  
Little johnny hooker learned his lesson from the knife now you see,  
(yes he did.)  
Because for what he done to fred he spent some time in a penitentiary.  
It was a day in the courtroom, exhibit letter "a."  
When the jury seen the knife they put little johnny's ass away.  
  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Oh, little johnny boy.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Oh, little johnny boy.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
He was a young boy,  
He's thinkin' the rest of his life,  
For what he done with the knife.  
Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Jooohhhnnny.

Sweet Sensation

I can feel those thrill's walking over  
When you hold me tight  
Now I feel those pains taking over  
When you say goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh what sweet sensation  
Lord what strange emotion  
You've got love and devotion  
And I won't forget your touch

But stay in your world  
You've got so much soul deep inside girl  
And love that's richer than gold

Boy Like You
Loretta Lynn
----------------
There's a jukebox in my ear playing so loud I can hardly hear  
It's tellin' a story about a boy like you  
And each selection that I make tells me how my heart will break  
For fallin' in love with a boy like you  
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean  
It says I probably spend my whole life feelin' blue  
So I'll put in one more dime and play that same song one more time  
Cause I wanna hear about a boy like you  
[ piano ]  
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean  
It says I probably spend my whole life feelin' blue  
I know that I should go on home but I can't stand to be alone  
Cause I always dream about a boy like you  
Yes I always dream about a boy like you

Family Tradition
Hank Williams
----------------
Country music singers  
Have always been a real close family  
But lately some of my kinfolk  
Have disowned a few others and me  
  
I guess it's because  
I kinda changed my direction  
And Lord, I guess I went  
And broke their family tradition  
They get on me want to know  
  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank, why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
Over and over  
Everybody met my prediction  
So if I get stoned I'm just carryin'  
On an old family tradition  
  
I am very proud  
Of my daddy's name  
Although his kind of music  
And mine ain't exactly the same  
  
Stop and think it over  
Put yourself in my position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long  
It's a family tradition  
  
So don't ask me  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank, why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
If I'm down in a honky tonk  
Some old slicks trying to give my friction  
I say leave me alone I'm singin' all night long  
It's a family tradition  
  
Lordy, I have loved some ladies  
And I have loved Jim Beam  
And they both tried to kill me in 1973  
  
When my doctor asked me  
"Son, how'd you get in this condition?"  
I said "Hey sawbones, I'm just carryin' on  
An old family tradition"  
  
So don't ask me  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
Stop and think it over  
Try to put yourself in my unique position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long  
It's a family tradition

Passion
Rod Stewart
----------------
Somebody somewhere  
In the heat of the night  
Looking pretty dangerous  
Running out of patience  
  
Tonight in the city  
You won't find any pity  
Hearts are being twisted  
Another lover cheated, cheated  
  
In the bars and the cafes, passion  
In the streets and the alleys, passion  
A lot of pretending, passion  
Everybody searching, passion  
  
Once in love you're never out of danger  
One hot night spent with a stranger  
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah  
Passion, passion  
Passion, passion  
  
New york, moscow, passion  
Hong kong, tokyo, passion  
Paris and bangkok, passion  
A lotta people ain't got, passion  
  
Hear it in the radio, passion  
Read it in the papers, passion  
Hear it in the churches, passion  
See it in the school yards, passion  
  
Once in love you're never out of danger  
One hot night spent with a stranger  
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah  
Once in love you're never out of danger  
One hot night spent with a stranger  
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah  
  
Alone in your bed at night, passion  
It's half past midnight, passion  
As you turn out your sidelight, passion  
Something ain't right, passion  
  
There's no passion, there's no passion  
There's no passion, i need passion  
You need passion, we need passion  
Can't live without passion  
Won't live without passion  
  
Even the president needs passion  
Everybody i know needs some passion  
Some people die and kill for passion  
Nobody admits they need passion  
Some people are scared of passion  
Yeah passion

Suicide Solution
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows  
  
Evil thoughts and evil doings  
Cold, alone you hang in ruins  
Thought that you'd escape the reaper  
You can't escape the Master Keeper  
  
'Cause you feel like you're living a lie  
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why  
Then you ask from your cask us there life after birth  
What you sow can mean Hell on this earth  
  
Now you live inside a bottle  
The reaper's traveling at full throttle  
It's catching you but you don't see  
The reaper is you and the reaper is me  
  
Breaking laws, knocking doors  
But there's no one at home  
Made your bed, rest your head  
But you lie there and moan  
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out  
Don't you know what it's really about  
  
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows

I Won't Close My Eyes
UB40
----------------
I won't close my eyes  
To the sufferers plight.  
In a world full of sadness  
I won't turn off my light.  
  
Our cries for justice are shots in the dark  
But our strength's in our bite  
And not in our bark  
It's time to stand  
And shout it out loud  
And the louder we scream  
The sweeter the sound.  
  
I won't close my eyes  
When I know that I'm right  
When I'm drowning in tears  
I won't turn off my light.  
  
We're shown no respect  
But that can't break our pride,  
When our backs to the wall  
We won't run and we won't hide  
It's time to stand, face the oncoming crowd  
And the louder we scream  
The sweeter the sound.  
  
I won't close my eyes  
When the future don't look bright  
Though the road seems too long  
I won't turn off my light  
In a world full of darkness,  
I won't turn off my light.

The Rest Of The Night
Natalie Cole
----------------
oh, oh, oh  
Oh, yeah  
Baby, what's your hurry  
Where are you going so fast  
You can keep your motor runnin'  
But don't run out of gas  
Getting there is half the fun  
  
Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me  
And the best of my love's yet to come (yet to come)  
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you  
So take a little longer, my love can only get stronger  
(Stronger, stronger)  
  
If we're gonna climb a mountain  
We gotta take our sweet time  
When you're traveling down love's highway  
Don't you know speeding is a crime  
Listen, getting there is half the fun  
Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me  
And the best of my love's yet to come (yet to come)  
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you  
So take a little longer  
  
My love can only get stronger (stronger, stronger)  
Oh, my Baby, we gotta slow down (ooh)  
Take your time, ease your mind (oh, Baby, mm)  
Stronger, rest of my life, I'm gonna love you  
So just take a little longer, and our love is gonna get stronger  
(Cause you've got the rest of the night) oh, yeah  
(And the best of my love) yet to come (yet to come)  
Oh, baby, for (rest of my life) I'm gonna love you  
I want you to take your time  
  
Love me baby, love me baby, love me, love me (rest of my life)  
Slow down baby, I ain't going no where (best of my love)  
So why don't we just take our sweet time (rest of my life)  
Don't rush me, you're gonna crush me, let the feeling come  
Oh, remember that song about a slow hand (rest of the night)  
  
Now she had the right idea (oh)  
So, Baby, what's the hurry, (best of my love)  
we've got forever  
If we don't use it up too fast (oh, ah)  
Take it slow, calm down, smell the roses  
We'll get there, don't you worry  
(Rest of the night, to hold me) (best of my love, yet to come)

Down The Road Apiece
Rolling Stones
----------------
Now if you want to hear some boogie like I'm gonna play  
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass  
The drummer's man's a cat they call Charlie McCoy  
You know, remember that rubber legged boy?  
Mama cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease  
Come on along boys it's just down the road apiece  
  
Well there's a place you really get your kicks  
It's open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece  
  
Well there's a place you really get your kicks  
It's open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece

Never Be The Same
Crowded House
----------------
Don't stand around like friends at a funeral  
Eyes to the ground  
It could've been you  
Why do you weep for the passing of ages  
You slip with the back of your hand  
You're taking it out on the one you love  
I couldn't believe it  
  
[Chorus:]  
But we might still survive  
And rise up through the maze  
If you could change your life  
And never be the same  
  
How long must I wait  
For you to release me  
I pay for each mistake  
While you suffer in silence  
  
I could still have an easy life  
But the lie ain't worth the living  
Once more will I hear you say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stand around  
Like friends at a funeral  
Eyes to the ground  
Don't suffer in silence  
  
Cause we might still survive  
And rise up through the maze  
If you could change your life  
And never be the same  
  
And every time I hear you  
Never be the same  
And every time I mess up  
Never be the same

Heaven Can Wait
Meat Loaf
----------------
Heaven can wait  
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart  
Will take me through the lonely night  
Through the cold of the day  
And I know  
I know  
Heaven can wait  
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me  
And the melody's gonna make me fly  
Without pain  
Without fear  
Give me all of your dreams  
And let me go along on your way  
Give me all of your prayers to sing  
And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day  
I got a taste of paradise  
I'm never gonna let it slip away  
I got a taste of paradise  
It's all I really need to make me stay  
Just like a child again  
  
Heaven can wait  
And all I got is time until the end of time  
I won't look back  
I won't look back  
Let the altars shine  
  
And I know that I've been released  
But I don't know to where  
And nobody's gonna tell me know  
And I don't really care  
No no no  
I got a taste of paradise  
That's all I really need to make me stay  
I got a taste of paradise  
If I had it any sooner you know  
You know I never would have run away from my home  
  
Heaven can wait  
And all I got is time until the end of time  
I won't look back  
I won't look back  
Let the altars shine  
  
Heaven can wait  
Heaven can wait  
I won't look back  
I won't look back  
Let the altars shine  
Let the altars shine

Miley Cyrus

We haven't met, and that's okay  
'Cause you will be asking for me one day  
  
Don't want to wait in line  
The moment is mine believe me  
  
Don't close your eyes  
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'  
And I think that I can shake it

I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve

Electrified, I'm on a wire  
Gettin' together and we're on fire

And I think that I can show you

You make me feel free  
And I, I need to uncover  
The part of you that's reaching out for me  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
I know I can change the world  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  
  
I know what ya like  
I know what ya think  
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink  
It's  
Everything you see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve  
(Repeat)

Old Park Bench
Inside Out
----------------
A sea of smile and a river of tears  
A flood of memories  
Imagination will take me back  
I'll be with you  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
A summer's night, the stars aglow  
Did more than light the sky  
With fortune, fantasy, and fate  
We dream on an old park bench  
I take your hand in my hand  
You hold my soul in yours  
One touch becomes eternal  
When falling in love  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
I see her still and she is beautiful  
I see her beautiful face  
And her beautiful eyes  
And her beautiful ways  
And her beautiful soul  
And this love lifts me higher  
I search her eyes and see the skies  
The heavens of her life  
Just one more glimpse into her soul  
Is all I ask  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
A sea of smiles and a river of tears  
A flood of memories  
And now she's gone  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench

Take It Away
Used
----------------
I'm lying to myself  
And this dagger is my excuse  
I'm a pawn  
I should have paid up  
And I left an hour late  
I was laid up  
  
I must abuse myself  
I'm against all that I've made up  
Set in stone the sun will come  
And I hate light  
You know I hate light  
To me it looks so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
I must have caught something  
In the heat of all these dances  
I'm a worm with no more chances  
And I've lost all doubt  
In a chemical romance  
  
I can't stop itching  
Over thoughts of tarnished hope  
Kinda funny  
Lonely feeling  
I'm not in love  
You know it's not love  
Don't make it look so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Brothers and sisters  
I'm right here with you  
Cause everyone's got one  
A story to to kill me  
I'm so apathetic in my resentment  
Living, loving, knowing not  
  
Take my hand(x8)  
Take my life  
Take my heart take my mind  
Take my life take my life  
  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take my life  
Take my life

A Hero Comes Home
Idina Menzel
----------------
Out of the mist of history  
He'll come again  
Sailing on ships across the sea  
To a wounded Nation  
  
Signs of a saviour  
Like fire on the water  
It's what we prayed for  
One of our own  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Deep in the heart of darkness sparks  
A dream of light  
Surrounded by hopelessness  
He finds the will to fight  
  
There's no surrender  
Always remember  
It doesn't end here  
We're not alone  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
And he will come back on the crimson tide  
Dead or alive  
And even though we know the bridge has burned  
He will return  
He will return  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He knows of places unknown  
Always  
A hero comes home  
  
Someday they'll carve in stone  
"The hero comes home"  
  
He goes and comes back alone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home

Monkey Man
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
Great monkey man has gone the distance,  
The lucky one's going to get it.  
Loving life now,  
Living on top of.  
Lucky ones always get it all.  
  
Oh, I'm hungry,  
Don't wanna die like a little dog.  
Gonna take what I can get,  
I'm the monkey man,  
With the great, great monkey plan.  
  
It's crazy, crazy, little man,  
You've got yourself entangled.  
  
Oh, love to lie to myself,  
To say everything is fine now.  
We got to keep it up,  
Or fall behind.  
I got to keep it up,  
Or lose the edge we found faster.  
I'll build higher, still higher,  
I dig deeper down,  
Til it's down in the ground.  
It's found, used up and then thrown out.  
  
Crazy, crazy little man,  
What do you think you're doing here?  
  
Big, beautiful world just for us,  
Good use we must put it to.  
Any way I can think to use it up,  
What will I tell my grandson's grandsons?  
  
I could weave a fairy tale,  
On a great bible-thumping scale.  
When he stands empy hands,  
On his empty land,  
That's what happened here.  
Great, great monkey man.  
  
Where did you think grey was the color of this?  
You think I don't know quite what to say?  
But I'm worried for myself in this.  
  
I'm hungry,  
Don't wanna die like a little dog.  
Well, I eat what I can get,  
From the monkey man.  
Great, great monkey man.  
Great, great monkey plan.  
  
Crazy, crazy man,  
You get yourself turned in a pickle.  
  
Crazy, crazy monkey man,  
Who is the one in the middle?  
  
Take a walk,  
Cross the ice,  
Melts too quickly for us to reach the other side.  
  
It's cold in here,  
But the sun shines bright.  
Oh, it warms this up well,  
Oh, the tide is rising higher.  
  
Look, it's strange,  
Floating by.  
Looks just like the ones,  
That flow out and ride, oh, I will.  
  
Golden age,  
These golden times,  
Our golden days seem to have us,  
Hypnotized or blind, well.

Die For Metal
Manowar
----------------
They can't stop us  
Let 'em try  
For Heavy Metal  
We will die!  
  
Quit my job this morning sad forever  
I would hold my head up high  
Cause I need Metal in my life  
Just like an eagle needs to fly  
  
So I walked outside into the street  
From a hall I heard thunder and screams  
I walked inside so I could hear  
And the guy beside me gave me a beer  
  
He had his fist up in the air  
And called me brother said my friends  
Are over there  
  
They call themselves Immortals  
They're the truest of the true  
And in that very moment  
I was born again like you  
  
They said hold your head up high  
Raise your fist up in the air  
Play Metal louder than Hell  
Louder than Hell  
  
They can't stop us  
Let 'em try  
For Heavy Metal  
We will die!  
  
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on  
Know my words are true  
There's a battle for true Metal  
They're marching

Blue Light
Ultravox
----------------
Thought I'd take the slide  
I thought I'd be alright  
But when the details swam  
Oh no, the door got jammed  
Someone took the hand  
And we were out slow dancing  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
There was a crowd below  
Swanning in the glow  
All the paste it shimmered  
In the swimmer's glimmer  
It was a sticky summer  
And I was diving under...  
The Blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
Well nothing drove out behind me  
I was so glad  
Even the walls were turning round  
Well, someone said  
There was something wrong  
But I couldn't quite  
Put my finger on it  
What the...  
Well I thought I heard...  
And I tried to...  
Then we were just diving  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light

I want to be your hero

Skeletons
Stevie Wonder
----------------
Skeletons in your closet  
Itchin' to come outside  
Messin' with your conscience  
In a way your face can't hide  
  
Oh things are gettin' real funky  
Down at the old corral  
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'  
It's the stinkin' lies you tell  
  
What did your mama tell you about lies  
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one  
What did your daddy tell you about lies  
He said one white one turns into a black one  
  
So, it's gettin' ready to blow  
It's gettin' ready to show  
Somebody shot off at the mouth and  
We're gettin' ready to know  
  
It's gettin' ready to drop  
It's gettin' ready to shock  
Somebody done turned up the heater  
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop  
  
Crevices in your pantry  
Now what do we have in here  
Havin' a daytime nightmare  
Has always been your biggest fear  
  
Oh things are gettin' real crucial  
Up the old wazoo  
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?  
When the culprit's why-o-you  
  
What did your mama tell you about lies  
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one  
What did your daddy tell you about lies  
He said one white one turns into a black one  
  
So, it's gettin' ready to blow  
It's gettin' ready to show  
Somebody shot off at the mouth and  
We're gettin' ready to know  
  
It's gettin' ready to drop  
It's gettin' ready to shock  
Somebody done turned up the heater  
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop  
  
It's gettin' ready to seep  
You're gettin' ready to freak  
Somebody done picked up the talk box  
We're gettin' ready to speak  
  
It's gettin' ready to jive  
You're gettin' ready to gel  
Somebody done gone let the lid off  
We're gettin' ready to smell  
  
They're gettin' ready to deal  
You're gettin' ready to ill  
Somebody done just dropped the big dime  
And they're gettin' ready to squeal  
  
It's gettin' ready to turn  
We're gettin' ready to learn  
Somebody done fired up the brimstone  
And you're gettin' ready to burn  
  
It's gettin' ready to shake  
You're gettin' ready to ache  
Somebody done snitched to the news crew  
And it's gettin' ready to break  
  
You're gettin' ready to lie  
They're gettin' ready to spy  
Somebody's been put on the hot seat  
And you're gettin' ready to fry

The Chosen One
Bread
----------------
I was your first and you were my last  
And we are the journey's end  
I was the blues and you were my sunshine friend  
  
Now I'm your lover, you are my cover  
Keeping the loneliness from me  
You are my chosen one, arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
You are the sea and I am the sailor  
Riding the perfect wave  
I could've drowned but you came around and save me  
She won't play your game  
  
Now I'm your hopes and you are my dreamer  
Helping me see beyond tomorrow  
You are the chosen one, you'll always be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Out of the darkness, out of the shadow  
Oh wherever you go, I'll follow along  
Wherever you lead me, wherever you need me  
I'll bring you my message, I'll bring you my song  
  
You are the chosen one, arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Darlin' I choose you, I'll never use you  
I couldn't abuse you with all that you've done  
You are my sunshine, you are my lifeline  
Forever my sweet wine, forever the one

Send Me An Angel
Pet Shop Boys
----------------
Do you believe in heaven above?  
Do you believe in love?  
Don't tell me a lie  
Don't be false or untrue  
It all comes back to you  
  
Open fire on my burning heart  
I've never been lucky in love  
My defenses are down  
A kiss or a frown  
I can't survive on my own  
  
If a girl walks in  
And carves her name in my heart  
I'll turn and run away  
Everyday we've all been led astray  
  
It's hard to be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now right now  
  
Empty dreams can only disappoint  
In a room behind your smile  
But don't give up don't give up  
You can be lucky in love

10 Million Stars
LL Cool J
----------------
You can call it a comeback  
I lay back, analyze the rhymes and realize  
I own that crown for lyrical combat  
Spit more raps to count more stacks  
Kicking back in the coup  
I got loops relax, I'm hotness  
Monotonous fans is running bizzack  
L please don't leave the game like thizzat  
Never in a million years  
I'll never let you down baby  
I drop 50, I steal gravy  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I look back on Venus  
I look (I look) back on Mars  
And (and) I burn with the fire  
Of ten (of ten) million stars (LL: guess who's back, uh)  
  
I'm more then a conqueror  
Double up your bets  
Come and rumble with the decks  
I know you had that clown picked  
Mind blowing out 'cause L still sound sick  
You dream you was me  
I gleam lyrically  
I love 'em for it it's the highest form of flattery  
Doin' the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery  
My, clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'  
Rippers is just learning by stacks I been earnin'  
I'm the uncle, hell, future of the funk  
Turn my joint up, find out why I'm different from all these chumps  
And tell your favorite rapper that I'm ready to dump  
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Six figure interest on the cheddar  
From music, fashion, film and television  
Poppin' amaretto, so what got a vendetta?  
I never felt better  
Now forever competition get severed by skills you can't measure  
I'm a champ, you a peon  
Kiss the ring, begone  
Known and respected on any block you be on  
And be on, stand there, get your mad on  
I chuckle cause there's nothing to waste energy on  
There you have it  
The uncut raw for rap addicts  
Waited three years to see if L still had it  
Ten million stars  
Got beef to the deck  
End of my contract, I'm the last one left!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
L's worth paper  
Dash that damn who put em up in that skyscraper (yeah)  
(I take them seriously baby)  
Ask my dogs up in old five, who made a major?  
LL playa  
Now who's next to need a paper  
Drop a bomb on them  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I look back on Venus  
I look back on mars  
And I burn with the fire  
Of ten million stars

Tori Amos

Angie, Angie  
When will those clouds all disappear?  
Angie, Angie  
Where will it lead us from here?  
With no lovin' in our soul and no money in our coats  
You can't say we're satisfied  
But Angie, Angie  
You can't say we never tried  
  
Angie, you're beautiful  
But I hate that sadness in your eyes  
Angie, I still love you baby  
Remember all those nights we cried  
All the dreams were held so close  
Seemed to all go up in smoke  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Angie, Angie  
Where will it lead us from here? Yeah  
  
All the dreams we held so close  
Seemed to all go up in smoke  
Hate that sadness in your eyes  
But Angie, I still love you baby  
Everywhere I look I see your eyes  
There ain't a woman that comes close to you  
Come on baby dry your eyes  
But Angie, Angie  
Ain't it good to be alive  
Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried

Go Tell It On The Mountain
Religious Music
----------------
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.  
  
While shepherds kept their watching  
Over silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light.  
  
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo! Above the earth  
Rang out the angels chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth.  
  
Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn...

Only When You're Lonely
Bruno Mars
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do  
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you  
Waiting all day, but now you want to call me  
Why do you do this to me all the time?  
  
[Chorus]  
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back  
But now I know the truth, I can finally see  
You only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
  
[Verse 2]  
Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart  
Because I loved you, loved you  
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl  
With no one to turn you  
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer  
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything  
  
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back  
But now I know the truth, I can finally see  
You only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
  
Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it  
You just think of yourself and never me at all  
If you're with your friends, you just string me along  
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
  
[Verse 3]  
I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

Can't Lie To My Heart
Richard Marx
----------------
I whispered you  
Words I thought I'd never say  
We played the game  
But then we tossed the rules away  
Could deny it  
Justify it  
But we both know we went too far  
Oh, I can feel you  
And I need you  
No matter wherever you are  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to watch my love come crashing down  
But I can't lie to my heart  
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round  
But baby I just can't lie to my heart  
  
I have loved you  
Longer than you've even known  
When you hurt I hurt  
I'm your flesh and you're my bone  
If I could only  
Be two people  
Darlin' I swear we'd both be with you  
Oh, I know I'm selfish  
But I'm helpless  
I want you and nothing else will do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't pretend anymore  
Been hiding too long  
I won't go on like before  
I'm not that strong  
I can feel it when I'm near you  
It's not healthy to need you this way  
Try to fight it, get inside it  
But this pain is stronger than me and it won't go away  
  
[Chorus]

Lead Me To The Cross
Hillsong United
----------------
Savior I come  
Quiet my soul, remember  
Redemption's hill  
Where Your blood was spilled  
For my ransom  
Everything I once held dear  
I count it all as lost  
  
[Chorus]  
Lead me to the cross  
Where Your love poured out  
Bring me to my knees  
Lord I lay me down  
Rid me of myself  
I belong to You  
Lead me, lead me to the cross  
  
You were as I  
Tempted and trialed  
You are  
The word became flesh  
Bore my sin and death  
Now you're risen  
  
Everything I once held dear  
I count it all as lost  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To your heart  
To your heart  
Lead me to your heart  
Lead me to your heart  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Good Luck
Counting Crows
----------------
Larry's in vegas..with some chick from La  
The best things are sevens and sex is just ok so please stay  
She said just stay  
Cause there's a show at 11 and the drinks are all free you can do  
Better for yourself but not me ....  
...so please stay and keep me company.  
All the while thinking this is the good luck, stays with her most of the time  
Takes time to make these machines work, people are so unkind  
Gets kinda nervous  
Used to be hard.  
She takes the edges off evenings in bedrooms and back seats in big cars.  
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time  
It takes time to make these machines work people are so unkind.  
People are so unkind  
She looks in the mirror  
To make she's here  
She keeps disappearing and dreaming of movie stars- weddings and nothing is
happening  
He tries not to notice  
She thinks he doesn't care.  
Capture yourself in a jar and you stay there,  
Until you vanish  
Thin air  
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time  
It takes time to make these machines work but he aint got time while  
She's riding in black cars and pokes at the sky to see if he can make stars
and  
People are so unkind  
People are so unkind..  
People are so unkind..  
People are so unkind...  
People are so unkind  
People are so..  
UN  
KIND..

Dirty Dreams
Alice Cooper
----------------
Well, I wake up burnin' in a soaking sweat  
My pillows are drippin' and the sheets are wet  
I jump out of bed and I turn on the light  
This happens to me every night  
Sometimes you turn into a snake with long black hair  
Then you turn into an angel, blonde and fair  
You can turn yourself blue and I don't care  
You can change your look  
You can change your race  
But it's always your touch  
And always your face  
  
[Chorus:]  
Dirty dreams  
How you want to do me  
Dirty dreams  
Let me get through  
Dirty dreams  
A triple X-rated movie starring me and you  
  
Well, I close my eyes  
And you open your lips  
There's a shock from my head to my fingertips  
I fall through a hole 'cause I can't get a grip  
The room starts to spin and the world starts to turn  
My heart catches fire and my bed starts to burn  
  
Dirty dreams  
How you want do me  
Dirty dreams  
Anything for you, babe  
Dirty dreams  
Technicolor movie starring me and you  
Make my dreams come true  
  
Shake my nights  
Rattle my sleep  
Roll my eyes, I'm in too deep  
  
[Chorus]

Join Me
HIM
----------------
Baby join me in death  
Baby join me in death  
Baby join me in death  
  
We are so young  
Our lives have just begun  
But already we're considering  
Escape from this world  
  
And we've waited for so long  
For this moment to come  
We're so anxious to be together  
Together in death  
  
Won't you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
Won't you die  
Baby join me in death  
Won't you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
  
This world is a cruel place  
And we're here only to lose  
So before life tears us apart let  
Death bless me with you  
  
Won't you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
Won't you die  
Baby join me in death  
Won't you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
  
This life ain't worth living  
This life ain't worth living  
This life ain't worth living  
This life ain't worth living  
  
Won't you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
Won't you die  
Baby join me in death  
Won't you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
  
Baby join me in death

The Idol
W.A.S.P.
----------------
Will I be alone this morning?  
Will I need my friends?  
Something just to ease away the pain  
And now I never see the loneliness  
Behind my face  
I am just a prisoner to my faith  
  
If I could only stand and stare in the mirror would I see  
One fallen hero with a face like me  
And if I scream, could anybody hear me  
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me  
  
Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely  
I'll never know if love's a lie  
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy  
Can you see the prisoners in my eyes  
Where is the love to shelter me  
Give me love, love set me free  
Where is the love, to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
Set me free

Come And Get It
Judas Priest
----------------
Do you like it heavy  
Do you love it mean  
Do you want it dirty  
We don't play it clean  
  
Standing in the spotlight  
Ceiling to the floor  
I can see you rockin'  
Let me hear you roar  
  
Turn it up  
Tear it down  
Hammering through  
Can you feel the sound  
  
Any day. Any night  
Midnight madness  
Dynamite  
  
If you want it  
Come and get it  
Do you want it  
Come and get it  
  
Can you feel the power  
Blinded by the light  
Keep on goin' crazy  
Burnin' up the night  
  
Shouting out together  
Boiling like the sun  
Metal lives forever  
Blazing on and on  
  
Turn it up  
Tear it down  
Hammering through  
Can you feel the sound  
  
Any day. Any night  
Midnight madness  
Dynamite  
  
If you want it  
Come and get it  
Do you want it  
Come and get it  
  
Do you like it heavy  
Do you love it loud  
  
If you want it  
Come and get it  
Do you want it  
Come and get it

Old Records Never Die
Ian Hunter
----------------
Sometimes you realize  
That there is an end to life.  
Yesterday I heard them say  
A hero's blown away.  
And it's so hard to lose  
Someone who's close to you.  
Oh me, I did not see  
The danger every day.  
But music's something in the air,  
So he can play it anywhere.  
Old records never die.  
  
Get you're healing from a song,  
Just when everything goes wrong.  
Play it right  
Through the night  
Till morning brings you light.  
And if some folk laugh at you  
Let 'em all laugh they never knew.  
Oh all those scenes, to me it seems  
Some folk never dream.  
??, I feel a force  
Rebel with some other cause.  
Old records never die.  
  
Old records never die.  
You can watch the waves roll by.  
You can see it in their eyes.  
Old records never die.  
Old records never die.  
You can watch the waves roll by.  
??  
Old records never die.  
I can hear you  
And I know why  
Old records never die.

Boogie Woogie Wu
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
Boogie Woogie Wu  
  
"The beast lives out of the raging storm in the dead of night  
The ravenous, blood-sick creatures searches for it's sacrifice  
Through the hideous darkness, it lurches, driven by death itself  
Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to  
The darkness from which it came"  
  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu(2x)  
  
Boys and girls, it's nighty night time  
Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme  
It's about, The Boogie Woogie Man  
Keep your light on as long as you can  
Cause when it cuts off, so does your head  
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed  
With a shank, splah!, up through the bottom  
Little Jimmy Jimmy, uh, got em  
  
"It's the one and only Boogie Man  
He creeps, he hides, he sneaks, he slides  
If you little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed  
You're running on stumps motherfucker!!!"  
  
Well, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in  
Things go bump in the night, me creeping  
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe  
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor  
Fuck it, you're dead anyway  
And I'm gonna leave your head smack dab in the hallway  
In the morning, when your daddy walks out  
AAAAHHH!!! His foots in your mouth, thanks to the Boogie Man  
  
[Chorus]  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (here comes the boogie man)  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (haha haha haha haha)  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (make way for the boogie man)  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (mom! dad! ah! no!)  
  
"Does the Boogie Man really exist?"  
Well, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? yes  
You fall asleep and you wake up dead  
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead  
I sing lullabies till you dose off  
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off  
And then spit em out back in your face  
Splat! Fuck, wash your feet bitch!  
  
"The world's famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you  
Slumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights  
What the occasion for the midnight hour  
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up"  
  
I don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (no no)  
But I'll cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it  
"I bet you didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown  
But when you see the juggla, your holding your jugular"  
With a swing, chop, stab, swing, chop  
You're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop  
And the cops do the best they can  
They pull the axe out your face and say  
"Was it the Boogie Man?"  
What was he wearing?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Please don't let me fall asleep  
Cause the Boogie Man will creep  
Through my window in my room  
Stab me with a broken broom  
Please don't let me fall sleep  
Cause the Boogie Man will creep  
Through my window in my room  
Stahhh, Boogie Woogie Woogie!"  
  
"It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man  
Go ahead, pull the covers over your head  
Hide under them, he don't give a fuck  
It'll just make it that much more easier  
For him to suffocate your face!"  
  
There's three ways to stop me from doing what I do  
What? you think I'm a tell you  
"Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?"  
Thanks, an easy way in, you fucking idiot  
Now I stretch your neck out and play in like a banjo  
Boomchicka boomchicka like that shit, yo?  
Then I stretch it out more and fling your head through the wall  
It's the Boogie Man y'all  
  
[Chorus]

Constant Change
Jose Mari Chan
----------------
We're on the road  
We move from place to place  
And oftentimes when I'm about to call it home  
We'd have to move along  
Life is a constant change...  
  
The friends we know we meet along the way  
Too soon the times we share form part of yesterday  
'Cause life's a constant change  
And nothing stays the same, oh no  
  
Clouds that move across the skies  
Are changing form before our very eyes  
  
Why couldn't we keep time from movin' on?  
Hold on to all the years before this moment's gone?  
Why must we live the days at such a frightening pace?  
  
We're all like clouds that move across the skies  
And changing form before our very eyes  
  
Have we outgrown our Peter Pans and wings?  
We've simply grown too old for tales of knights and kings  
'Cause life's a constant change  
And nothing stays the same, oh no

Starstruck
Rainbow
----------------
If I'm high on a hill  
She'd still been looking down at me  
What does she see that brings her closer every day to my heart  
If I'm away from home  
And think I'm all alone  
She's there, somewhere  
I look around to see  
And looking back at me  
She's there, beware!  
  
Creeping like a hungry cat  
Seen it before  
I know it can mean that  
  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah  
  
I could fly to the moon  
But she'd soon find a way to be there  
I never knew for a while that a smile made 'em really care  
  
She wants a souvenir  
To everyone it's clear  
She's hooked, with one look  
She wants a photograph  
And everybody laughs but not me 'cause I see  
  
She's creeping like a hungry cat  
I've seen it before  
I know I can mean that  
  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck,oh  
Oh my  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me, yeah  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah  
  
It used to be a game  
Now I can't repeat my name at all  
She seems to believe that  
I never can refuse a call  
  
She wants a souvenir  
To everyone it's clear  
She's hooked! With one look!  
She wants a photograph  
And everybody laughs, hah!  
But not me 'cause I see  
  
She's creeping like a hungry cat  
I've seen it before  
I know it can mean that  
  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, bad luck  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
  
The lady starstruck running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck  
And back of a tree, looking back at me  
Climbing up my stair  
I've just got to beware  
Lady starstruck, yes, she's bad luck, bad luck

Paper Game
Z-Ro
----------------
[Chorus - 2x]  
All my niggas stay alive in this dirty game  
Niggas working 9 to 5 in this dirty game  
But all my niggas gone survive in this dirty game  
Because we pack a 45 in this dirty game  
[Z-Ro]  
Everyday my mind is set on money making ways  
Even kick in doors, I can't be broke in money making days  
I can't get no job in a white man's world that's why I live so raw  
I can't watch my children starve homeboy so watch me break the law  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Ramon noodles, t.v. dinners ain't no way to live  
Rather be holding slab while grabbing grain rolling airport load for sive  
In the streets of Houston Texas hustlers living in the cuts  
On a mission chasing paper got no time for gold digging hoes get off my nuts  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
I'm turning suicidal in my older age, this game'll freeze you to death  
And eveyrday I face the coldest stage  
Tell me does every nigga that's thugging got to struggle to bubble  
And so I'm ready to laugh successfully you don't want no troule  
Cause I'm living more rugged than rougher than the rockiest road  
I'm paronoid for life, got to keep a glock in the load  
Am I addicited to caine (watch that tooting line)  
Could it be a nigga that's hard to locate is somebody you could find  
Z-Ro, certified platinum on a million dollar paper chase  
Pulling up next to the police and blowing this weed in they face  
But they try to blow my high when I'm on this hyper toiliking weed  
But I'm gonna slice skills with hands that'll make you vomet and bleed  
Aunte be worrying about me so I'm trying to get her to smile  
But I know she know I'm wanted dead or alive  
Got to keep my mind on my money making maneuvers cause my hustle is strong  
A lot of fools get lazy now they hustle is gone  
But I'm a hustler for life  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro talking]  
Nigga hell yeah, know what I'm saying  
Bridgemont Texas baby coming straight at you  
Motherfucking 199 motherfucking 7  
For real we ain't even gone play with you nigga

Man you fuck around and get mashed on for real we coming around this bitch  
For self Bridgemont, we hustlers for life nigga, straight four for life nigga

You Don't Know
Cyndi Lauper
----------------
You don't know where you belong  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
You just need to belong somehow.  
  
Relying on rhetoric...  
Not well versed on topics...  
Any idea what you're talking about?  
Revisions of history  
Fair well in some company  
But don't shove that bullshit down my throat  
  
You don't know where you belong...  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
To find something to swear to...  
Till you don't know what's right from wrong  
You just need to belong somehow.  
  
Left suppresses right  
Right suppresses left  
So what's the left, and what's right?  
You're told what to wear,  
You're told what to like  
I'd be nice if you'd think for yourself sometime,  
But you don't.  
  
Now you don't know where you belong...  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
  
Mix sheer hypocrisy with mediocrity  
You'll play it safe every time  
So life turns up empty  
And you're so dissatisfied  
Who are you blaming this time?  
Don't you know?

These Four Walls
Miley Cyrus
----------------
These four walls  
They whisper to me  
They know a secret  
I knew they would not keep  
It didn't take long  
For the room to fill with dust  
And these four walls came down around us  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
It's hard now to let you be  
I won't make excuses  
I've made my peace  
It didn't take long  
For me to lose the trust  
Cause these four walls  
Were not strong enough  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Yeah  
It's difficult  
Watching us fade  
Knowing it's all my fault  
My mistake  
Yeah, and it's difficult  
Letting you down  
Knowing it's all my fault  
You're not around  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Again  
These four walls again

Beauty On The Fire
Natalie Imbruglia
----------------
Here it comes again  
Cannot out run my desire  
Cover my decent  
And throw the  
Beauty on the fire  
Drawn towards the edge  
Do I assume I could fly  
Every secret shared  
Why do I drink  
The feelings dry  
Don't go too far  
Limitation scars  
  
Tonight  
Could I be lost forever  
To drown  
My soul in  
Sensory  
Pleasure  
Sensory  
Pleasure  
  
Here it comes again  
You raise the bar even higher  
I cannot catch my breath  
So throw the  
Beauty on the fire  
Don't push too hard  
Limitaion scars

Lullaby To An Anxious Child
Sting

Hush child,  
Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise  
Hush child,  
Let me soothe the shining tears that gather in your eyes  
  
Hush child,  
I won't leave I'll stay with you to cross this Bridge of Sighs  
Hush child,  
I can help the look of accusation in your eyes  
In your eyes  
  
The world is broken and now  
All in sorrow  
Wise men hang their heads  
  
Hush child,  
Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise  
Hush child,  
All the strength I'll need to find, I'll find inside your eyes  
In your eyes

It rolled me right along  
  
  
It was thunderin' and lightenin',  
But it rolled me right along  
It was thunderin', it was lightenin',  
Oh yeah, it rolled me right along

They didn't have no place to go, mmm  
  
  
Little children they were screamin'  
And cryin', Oh yeah  
The wind was howlin',  
They didn't have no place to go, mmm  
There were thousands o' people,  
They's goin' from door to door, mmm

Kept on rollin', Rollin'

Take me deeper, oh, Lord  
  
Glorious Son, to You I shall bow  
Bow my knee, bow my will  
Cherished by the strong and the weak  
Humble hearts shall hear You speak  
  
Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart  
And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper  
  
Oh, Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart  
And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper, oh, Lord  
  
By Your love, Lord, You opened my heart  
Now Your light will shine always  
By Your Word, Lord, Your promise secure  
And my soul will live always  
  
By Your love, Lord, You opened my heart  
Now Your light will shine always  
By Your word, Lord, Your promise secure  
And my soul will live always  
  
Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart  
And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper  
  
Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart  
And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper, oh, Lord, take me deeper, oh, Lord  
Take me deeper, oh, Lord

Ballad Of An Elder Woman
John Martyn
----------------
Now woman, don't you feel sad when you see your life go round  
And you realise you've been drinking all of your years like wine?  
You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win  
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying  
And woman, it's your heart I hear crying  
Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say  
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace  
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms  
Oh, but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman, it's your heart I see crying  
Now you're standing like some tree, oh, and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found

From the highest throne  
To the earth below  
You laid down Your life  
For the likes of us

To the valleys low

To the still of night  
Every waking moment  
For Your delight

In everything  
We live for Your glory  
Live for Your glory

Tom johnston  
It's late at night  
Can't go to sleep  
Eyes open wide  
Doin' the midnight creep  
Well it's just a holiday  
For a circus dream  
'cause I'm a music man baby  
Hangin' from a wire with no net below  
You know I'm gonna catch you if you fall  
Swirling dancers  
Driftin' in the night  
Make you go crazy  
Forget what is wrong and what is right  
'cause the melody gonna make you high  
Float you away like a cloud in the sky  
And the music man with a song for you  
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues  
Get it  
Come and get it  
When you get back home to your flat in the city  
Notice that your neighbor has the radio on  
Out of nowhere you gonna hear a sound  
Movin' through your head, spinning 'round and 'round  
And the music man with a song for you  
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues  
Get it  
Come and get it

Oh, is that all I was to you  
A pretty face with a name  
I guess that you can't explain  
How you went away...  
I hope you, you will find that special girl  
And you make her shine  
Baby, gave you heart and soul  
All you did was play a role...  
Baby boy now you are gone  
Oh, Mystic Man, tell me who are you today?  
Oh Mystic Man  
Do they know they're all being played?  
Oh Mystic Man  
Baby, tell me what is this?  
I'm out the door I can't take no more of your.... Shhhh(it)

Creep
Radiohead

When you were here before  
Couldn't look you in the eye  
You're just like an angel  
Your skin makes me cry  
  
You float like a feather  
In a beautiful world  
And I wish I was special  
You're so fuckin' special  
  
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here.  
  
I don't care if it hurts  
I want to have control  
I want a perfect body  
I want a perfect soul  
  
I want you to notice  
When I'm not around  
You're so fuckin' special  
I wish I was special  
  
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here.  
  
She's running out again,  
She's running out  
She's run run run run  
  
Whatever makes you happy  
Whatever you want  
You're so fuckin' special  
I wish I was special  
  
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,  
What the hell am I doing here?  
I don't belong here.  
I don't belong here.

At Amber
Morrissey
----------------
I'm calling you from the foyer  
Of the Sands Hotel  
Where the men and the women  
Are acquainted quite well  
  
And the drunkards keep on drinking  
And oh, my room is cold  
I'm disputing the bill  
I will sleep in my clothes  
  
And you, my invalid friend  
You slam the receiver when you say  
"If I had your limbs for a day  
I would steam away"  
  
I'm calling you from the foyer  
Of this awful hotel  
Where the slime and the grime  
Gel  
  
And I cannot - or, I do not  
And oh, my room is cold  
And I'm envying you never having to choose  
  
And you, my invalid friend  
You slam the receiver when you say  
"If I had your limbs for a day  
I would steam away"  
  
I'm calling you from the foyer  
Of the Sands Hotel  
It's not low-life, it's just people  
Having a good time  
And oh, my invalid friend  
Oh, my invalid friend  
In our different ways we are  
The same

Screaming
Pet Shop Boys
----------------
I've watched you from a distance  
I've passed you on the street  
I''m obsessed with you  
I don't know what to do  
To make you pay attention  
and fall in love with me  
I'm obsessed with you  
I don't know what to do  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
  
I've called you from the corner  
You don't pick up the phone  
I'm depressed by you  
I don't know what to do  
To make you understand me  
To hear you speak my name  
I''m impressed with you  
I could impress you too  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
  
I've explained it in my letters  
I'm miserable as sin  
I''m obsessed with you  
What am I gonna do?  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside

Thinking with my long hand  
Flippin' the paper

In start to wonder  
How you gonna handle me?  
When I'm under  
Swimming in the dark sea

Tell me something  
Something that can move me  
Don't tell me lies  
I swear your gonna lose me  
Big like an ocean  
Jealous of the fish it feeds  
Your devotion  
Swimming inside of me  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
It's all yours

Today's The Day
P!nk
----------------
[Verse 1]  
I've spent enough time alone  
Up in my bedroom at home  
Been kinda bored lately  
I hate on all I see  
It's all mundane to me  
This box I painted pains me  
But you could watch me  
You could help me down the rabbit hole with you  
I could go with you  
You could lead the way I'd go hand in hand with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh  
Today's the day I've been waiting for  
Tomorrow won't come after all  
Yesterday is so far away  
And today is the only day  
Somebody please stop the clock  
Oh oh oh  
Don't ever let this day stop  
Oh oh oh  
I never wanna go home  
No no no oh oh oh  
No no no  
No no no no no  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
I used to want to grow up  
I thought that I could be free  
But now I'm realizing  
It's cool, it ain't for me  
It's cool, cause all my dreams  
Are more than possibilities  
I get so vicious  
When I don't feel delicious  
I just need a friend  
So much to carry  
These days are kinda scary I don't want the fun to end  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh  
Today's the day I've been waiting for  
Tomorrow won't come after all  
Yesterday is so far away  
And today is the only day  
Somebody please stop the clock  
Oh oh oh  
Don't ever let this day stop  
Oh oh oh  
I never wanna go home  
No no no  
No no no  
No no no no no no no  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Bridge]  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say it's gonna go my way  
  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say it's gonna go my way  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh  
Today's the day I've been waiting for  
Tomorrow won't come after all  
Yesterday is so far away  
And today is the only day  
Somebody please stop the clock  
Oh oh oh  
Don't ever let this day stop  
Oh oh oh  
I never wanna go home  
No no no oh oh oh  
  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say it's gonna go my way  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say it's gonna go my way  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say today's my day  
I'mma say it's gonna go my way

Anguish And Fear
Yngwie Malmsteen
----------------
No more will I do all the things that I've done  
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun  
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away  
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find  
  
His soul had wandered through years of despair  
Eyes without expression told to beware  
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high  
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find  
  
No more will I do all the things that I've done  
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun  
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away  
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find

My Blue Christmas
Chuck Berry
----------------
If I could only have an hour of this holiday with you  
We could sit and rap together, spinning records old and new  
Have a little cake and a bit o' coke now and do the things we used to do  
  
Jingle bells will all be ringing and little kids' eyes all aglow  
Children strolling, singing carols, makin' tracks out in the snow  
Oh, but I'll be with you this Christmas, maybe yes and maybe no  
  
Christmas time is really joyful, oh, but it's a lonely season, too  
Many people are so cheerful and some are alone and blue  
What would make my Christmas happy if I could have it all alone with you  
  
But if I just can't be with you, let me call you on the phone  
I wanna tell you I still love you and how it feels to be alone  
Wanna wish you a merry Christmas as the old year passes on.

It Will Be A Good Day
Yes
----------------
Golden forest, golden lake  
Sanctuary, state of grace  
I will find reason a place to begin  
It will be a good day  
  
Beginning is one place, I've been before  
Watching the sunrise on the silver shores  
Setting me free again, leading the way  
It will be a good day  
  
Sometimes I forget, how mighty this earth  
Astounding winter skies, truth is in birth  
Peace that it brings to me, my beautiful eyes  
Be a good day  
  
Make me believe again  
Making me free again  
Making me see again  
  
Golden mountains, golden seas  
A thousand reasons singing to me  
Alive to this message, realizing it all  
Be a good day  
  
Learning to listen, learning to see  
Learning is power, making me free  
Free to believe again in my human side  
Giving me good reason  
Giving me good reason  
  
(Come tomorrow)  
Make me believe again  
(Destiny)  
(Take the river)  
Making me free again  
(To the sea)  
  
(Come tomorrow)  
Making me see again  
(Will be free)  
  
Like a river  
Time feels so much closer now  
You are with me, so real  
  
We make our own heaven  
Clear through the sky  
The making of reason for you and I  
I sing of each season  
Making us feel  
This will be a good day  
This will be a good day  
  
(Come tomorrow)  
Make me believe again  
(Destiny)  
  
(Take the river)  
Making me free again  
(To the sea)  
(Come tomorrow)  
Making me see again  
(Destiny)  
Like a river to the sea  
  
Make me believe again  
Making me free again  
(Come tomorrow)  
Making me see again  
(Destiny)  
  
(Take the river)  
Making me free again  
(To the sea)

Making me see again

Colonel Forbin's Ascent
Phish
----------------
Colonel Forbin stared up at the mountain  
And wiped away the beads of sweat  
That glistened on his brow  
His tired feet were buried in the quagmire  
And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him  
And fulfillment of his vow  
  
And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root  
And pulled his body upwards  
To a sea green mossy boulder  
And he dragged his weary carcass [or "shit-ass"] up the mountain  
  
And he climbed so slowly  
He climbed so slowly  
Ahead  
Ahead  
  
Suddenly he heard the crack of thunder  
And the rocks began to crumble overhead  
And tumble down the mountain to the  
Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs  
through which his path had led  
And the earth began to quake beneath his feet  
And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes  
And he stood amidst a sea of dust and rocks and stones  
Cascading down the mountain  
And a thousand birds were headed for the sky. Oh...  
  
The sacred creed will be yours  
And if you wait until tomorrow  
The sacred creed will be yours  
To devour  
Yours  
To seize  
And to obey  
Obey  
  
When the dust had cleared, the colonel lifted up his head  
And was driven to his knees by a blazing beam of light  
And he saw the silhouette that stood before him  
And he bowed in reverence  
Trembling in the shadow of the mighty legend's form  
Icculus the prophet stood before his eyes  
Looking down on Colonel Forbin  
Where he shuddered in the puddles and the muck  
And he quietly addressed him  
  
And he spoke so slowly  
He spoke so slowly  
Ahead  
He said  
  
Colonel Forbin I know why you've come here  
And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack  
I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird  
To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack  
And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow  
And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed  
But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure  
Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice  
And greed  
  
The sacred greed will be yours  
And if you wait until tomorrow  
The sacred creed will be yours  
To devour  
Yours  
To seize  
And to obey  
And to obey  
  
  
And the famous mockingbird swooped down out of the sky and landed on  
Icculus's shoulder, and Icculus whispered into the bird's ear, and it flew  
off toward Wilson's castle in the valley below.  
  
Fly Famous Mockingbird  
  
Fly famous mockingbird  
Fly...  
Fly famous mockingbird  
Fly...  
  
Fly famous mockingbird  
Fly...  
Fly famous mockingbird  
Fly...  
Fly...  
Fly...  
Fly famous mockingbird  
Fly...  
  
The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe
as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what
their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He
would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him. With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with
glue and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out
to find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King.

The Long And Winding Road
Regine Velasquez
----------------
The long and winding road  
That leads to your door  
Will never disappear  
I've seen that road before  
It always leads me here  
Lead me to you door  
The wild and windy night  
That the rain washed away  
Has left a pool of tears  
Crying for the day  
Why leave me standing here  
Let me know the way  
Many times I've been alone  
And many times I've cried  
Any way you'll never know  
The many ways I've tried  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door, oohoh  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door

Custer
Johnny Cash
----------------
Now I will tell you buster that I ain't a fan of Custer  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin'  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin'  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again  
Cause the General he don't ride well anymore  
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin'  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
For now the General's silent he got barbered violent  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
Oh the General he don't ride well anymore

Little Sadie
Grateful Dead
----------------
Went down last night to take a look around  
Met little Sadie and I blew her down, went right home, went to bed  
Forty-four colt smokes under my head  
And I began to think what a deed I'd done  
Grabbed my hat and away I run, made a good run, but a little too slow  
They overtook me in Jericho  
I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell  
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville  
Says "Young man, your name's Brown,  
Remember the night you blew Sadie down?"  
Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee,  
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree  
First degree and the second degree  
Got any papers won't you read 'em to me.  
They took me downtown all dressed in black  
Put me on the train and sent me back  
Sent me back to the county jail, I had nobody to go for my bail  
The judge and the jury they took the stand  
The judge hold the paper in his right hand  
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,  
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes

Lies
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
How come you don't realise the shape you're in  
Sweatin' over lies to justify the naked sin within  
A spineless irritation from some time before  
When more than life was cursin' through my veins.  
  
You made me and you slayed me and you tortured me  
Laughing as you lay upon our bed of bloody love - and left me.  
Think about me, drink about me, I don't care,  
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.  
  
If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,  
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.  
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,  
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.  
  
Across the street they're eating now and holding hands,  
An image of a priest with bibles lain across his hands for me.  
Don't think about me, drink about me, I don't care,  
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.  
  
If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,  
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.  
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,  
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.  
  
In the house, my mother's house, the clocks have all stood still,  
An empty picture frame upon a dirty window sill.  
In the yard, my father's yard, a tombstone breaks in two,  
Shattered by a lying snake like you.

Let It Go
Kirk Franklin
----------------
My mama gave me up when I was four years old  
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul  
Now it's cold 'cause I'm sleeping in my back seat  
Understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak  
Let me speak, I never had a chance to dream  
Ten years old finding love in dirty magazines  
Miss December you remember I bought you twice  
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price  
Had a sister that I barely knew  
Kind of got separated by the age of two  
Same mama different daddy so we couldn't fake it  
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked  
Take it serious the demons in the man's mind  
The same daddy with rape charges now he's doing time  
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years  
Haven't her but she's traded tears for fears  
  
Shout. Shout  
Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
So come on  
I'm talking to you  
So come on  
  
Sex was how I made it through  
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do?  
So where I'm from they call you gay and say you ain't a man  
Show them you ain't no punk  
Get all the girls you can  
A simple plan that still haunts me even now today  
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way  
No G.E.D. all I see is failure in my eyes  
If you listening then remember I apologize  
I was raised falling in the church  
Made mistakes heard the Lord's calling in the church  
After service on the parking lot getting high  
Wanted to be accepted so bad I was willing to die  
Even tried to tell the pastor but he couldn't see  
Years of low self esteem and insecurities  
Church taught me how to shout and how to speak in tongues  
But preacher teach me how to live now when the tongue is done, help me  
  
See I'm. See I'm  
Soul surviver. Soul survivor  
World survivor  
I just wanna let it go  
World survivor, soul survivor  
Just wanna let it go  
  
Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying  
You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying  
You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow  
Like that night mama died  
Hard to let it go  
You adopted me  
Cared for me  
And changed my name  
But I cursed at you  
Lied to you  
Left your pain  
It's not strange I can still see it in my head  
To know for hours you were laying in that bed  
If you listening to this record,  
If it's day our night  
If my mama still living treat your mama right  
Don't be like me and let that moment slip away  
And be careful cause you can't take back what you say  
To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go  
To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know  
The pain was preparation for my destiny  
And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me

Say It Isn't So
Irving Berlin
----------------
Say it isn't so,  
  
Say it isn't so,  
Everyone is saying  
You don't love me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
Everywhere I go,  
Everyone I know,  
  
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,  
Say it isn't so.  
People say that you,  
  
Found somebody new,  
And it won't be long  
Before you leave me,  
Say it isn't true,  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know,  
  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.

What Would You Do
ZZ Top
----------------
What would you do if you was to love me?  
What would you do if I loved you too?  
I knew that I'd fall like a sinner  
I'd rather fall in a sinner than fall in lose  
What would you do if you was to kill me?  
What would you do if I killed you too?  
I knew that I'd fall like a sinner  
I'd rather fall in sin than fall in lose  
Sometimes someone gets down and out  
Sometimes someone gets love divine  
What would I do if you was to fuck me?  
What would you do if I fuck you too?  
I know that I fuck like a sinner  
I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue  
I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue

Revelation
Ultravox
----------------
  
I see it every day  
As children play  
There's a future, watching, waiting  
No-one can deny  
The reasons why  
We are hurting  
Much more than believing  
You're deceiving with all these bitter lies  
I've just got to let you know this time  
That we've seen through your disguise  
Politically motivated total mind control  
Just as I predicted  
The innocent grow stronger through it all  
Chorus:  
It's no lie, it's a revelation  
Open your eyes to the revelation  
Visions in your mind  
Unfolding in our time  
There's a new world out there calling  
We are justified  
Almost hypnotised  
We are leading  
Somehow we are changing  
Rearranging the lexicon of life  
And there's nothing left to change this time  
Here we all stand unified  
Together we have motivated absolute control  
And just as I imagined  
We all realised we had it all  
(Chorus)  
Side by side, to the revelation  
Open your mind to the revelation

It's Gonna Get Better
Genesis
----------------
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better  
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come around  
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see  
  
He calls me over, calls me brother and I know  
Always fighting and moonlighting, it never ends  
In the city, if you're all alone  
There's a sister and she's standing next to her man  
In the darkness you feel the sharpness of steel  
And it's always there, in the city, if you're all alone  
  
Reach out, hands in the air, don't care just what they're saying  
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better  
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come around  
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see  
  
If it's gonna get better, it starts with a feeling  
If it's gonna get better, it's gonna take time  
If it's gonna get better, we've gotta start now  
'Cause I know everybody can feel it  
And I know everybody will see it  
'Cause it shows, and that shows I'm not dreaming  
'Cause you know, I know, it's time for a change

Springtime In Vienna
Tragically Hip
----------------
Instructions from the manual could not have been much more plain the blues are
still required the blues are still required again  
Past territorial piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from
the rooftops we live to survive our paradoxes  
  
Men here of the secret they pass in upholstered silence they only exist in
crisis they only exist in silence past territorial  
Piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from the rooftops we
live to survive our paradoxes we'll live to survive  
Our paradoxes

Maxwellton braes are bonnies where early fa's the dew  
And it's there that Annie Laurie gied me her promise true  
Gied me her promise true which n'er forgot shall be  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down an' dee  
Her brow is like the snawdrift ner neck is like the swan  
Her face is the fairest that e'er the sun shone on  
That e'er e'er the sun shone on and dark blue is her e'e  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee  
Like dew on the gowan lyin' is the fa' of her fairy feet  
And like winds in summer sighin' her voice is low and sweet  
Her voice is low and sweet and she's a' the worls tae me  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee

Jihad
Slayer
----------------
I have witnessed your death  
I've see it many times  
Your tortured screams  
Your decrypted little mind  
A father's son  
With pathetic eyes that bleed  
Twins in the end  
Begin and let the brothers fall  
  
I will see you burned alive  
Screaming for your God  
I will watch you die again for him  
  
God won't touch what I've done  
He cries upon my feet  
A privilege pain  
Beneath buried are your dead  
On splintered bones I walk  
Sifting through the blood  
Besieged in fear  
Await the coming of the God  
  
I will watch you die again for him  
  
Blood is raining downward  
The stain reflects the sun  
Conquer divide within  
Terrorize the mind  
I have seen the end it's yours  
Rosary in hand  
Your selfish flesh it melts  
Spilling from the sky  
  
I will see you burn alive  
Screaming for your God  
I will watch you die  
  
This is God's War  
God's War  
This is God's War  
God's War  
  
War of holy principles  
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction  
Slit the throat of heaven man  
And let his blood dilute the water  
Bury your dead  
  
Fuck your God erase his name  
A lady weeps insanewith sorrow  
I'll take his tower from the world  
You're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed  
  
This is God's War  
God's War  
This is God's War  
God's War  
Fucking Holy War  
  
Be optimistic, happy and calm  
Show no fear or anxiety  
Smile at the face of God  
And your reward will be eternity  
Holy warriors  
Your patience will be justified  
Everything is for him  
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it  
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers  
Strike above the neck and at all extremities  
For it's a point of no return for almighty God  
God will give victory to his faithful servant  
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy  
The great Satan

Rock 'n' Roll Pain Train
Kid Rock
----------------
15 years on this lonely road  
I paid my own way  
I carried my own load  
I never ask too much from no one  
  
I was much too proud  
All I ever wanted  
Was to play my music for a sold out crowd  
Bitches money fame  
  
They say I had it all  
6 foot 1  
I walked around like I was 10 feet tall  
Did you see me shine  
  
Where the hell were you now  
Detroit City back in '99  
Stoned out of my mind  
On that rock n' roll pain train  
  
I had to slow things down  
I live out in the woods now  
It helps me keep my feet on the ground  
Life's been good to me so far  
  
Hope it's been kind to you  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
Now I've been rollin' on love and lust  
  
I ride around on this million dollar bus  
But this bus is just a bus man  
I can't sleep at night  
Man I miss my babies  
  
And I'd really like to fuck my wife  
But she ain't here tonight  
On that rock n' roll pain train  
After the lights go down  
  
I live out in the woods now  
It helps me keep my feet on the ground  
Life's been good to me so far  
Hope it's been kind to you  
  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
I've seen this train wreck  
Time and time again  
  
I felt It's pain  
I've seen it take my friends  
You've got to stop and take a look man  
Or life will pass you by  
  
Get you a guitar and a good song  
That's all you really need to ride  
On that rock n' roll pain train  
I can't slow it down  
  
The music and the whiskey  
Don't it make you want to get loud  
Life's been good to me so far  
Hope It's been kind to you  
  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
The sun will always shine on you

Roll With It
Backstreet Boys
----------------
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
If you ever feel like no one cares  
When you try your best but you get nowhere  
Don't give in  
'Cause the times will come again  
When they criticize every move you make  
And you've had as much as you're gonna take  
Don't you worry  
Soon enough things will change  
  
Bridge  
  
And when it seems as though  
Nobody understands a man  
(understands)  
Don't let your head hang down  
You want to just stick to the plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Just roll, roll, roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
Just roll with it  
Everything will be fine  
Just roll with it  
It's gonna be alright  
Just roll with it  
Don't put yourself down  
Just roll with it  
  
If you just can't find someone to trust  
When you give your heart but you don't get much  
Don't you worry the time is gonna come  
  
The world's a school  
So much to learn  
So learn it well  
The world's a stage  
So act the fool  
No woman understands  
You've got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Everybody just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Come on now  
Just roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Just roll with it  
Backstreet says  
Roll with it  
Come on y'all  
Roll with it  
  
All the fellas roll  
Roll with it  
All the ladies roll  
Roll with it  
Everybody roll  
You've got to roll with it  
Just roll

Everybody roll with it

Everybody roll  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll

Horrible Histories

God Compare! God Compare!  
When blood must flow, we're in the know with God compare!  
Find out which gods selection offers the best protection  
Should you sacrifice a man to the god of your clan  
Or to the god of thunder, now would that be a blunder  
If a battle you could lose, the god of war's the one to choose!  
God Compare! God Compare!  
To stay alive and even thrive it's God Compare!  
Which one to choose we won't confuse with God Compare!

Harry Belafonte

Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?

Fly On The Wall
Miley Cyrus
----------------
You don't understand what it is  
That makes me tick  
But you wish you did  
You always second guess, wonderin  
I say yes but you just lose out every time  
  
If you only knew what I talked about  
When I'm with my friends just hangin out  
Then you'd have the inside scoop  
On what to say, what to do  
That way when you play the game  
Baby you can never lose  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
  
You'd love to know, the things I do  
When I'm with my friends, and not with you  
You always second guess, wonderin  
There's other guys I'm flirting with  
You should know by now  
  
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you  
If I make a promise, I'm comin thru  
Don't you wish that you could  
See me every second of the day  
That way you would have no doubt  
But baby, i would never stray  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
  
A little communication  
That'll go all the way  
You're getting misinformation  
Too much hearsay, hearsay  
  
And what I say is  
Come a little closer  
And what I'm gonna say is  
  
Don't You  
Don't You  
Don't You  
Don't you wish you were a?  
Hey!

Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall

It's about time  
It's all about  
Talk about  
Want to know  
There ain't no doubt!  
It's about time!  
Yeah yeah yeah  
(something)  
Turn your clocks back!

Borrowed Time
Cher
----------------
I turn my back on him  
Now it's you that makes me smile  
But in your arms, I'm restless  
Like I'm leaving in awhile  
I let the match and burned my bridges  
You were mine  
Now I got this feeling  
You'll be the next in line  
  
[Chorus:]  
Living on the love of another man's woman  
That's loving on borrowed time  
Like to make a song last forever  
But the next dance won't be mine  
Living on the love of another man's woman  
That's loving on borrowed time  
  
My old love's broken pieces  
And I ain't met the new  
You're here in the middle  
Hanging on until I do  
Cause I'm a train that stops  
At every station down the line  
You're a fool so desperate  
That you'll ride on borrowed time  
  
[Chorus x3]

Girls
Diana Ross
----------------
Girls, they are so lovely  
Oh girls, girls, oh, please love me  
Girls run around in your head  
'Til you wish you had boys instead  
Girls, they are such fragile stuff  
That you just can't get enough  
Oh girls, girls  
They are impossible  
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls  
Do I have girls?  
Let me tell you about some girls  
I have three girls  
Rhonda, Tracee and Chudney  
I have girls in my bathroom  
Girls in my closet  
Girls wearing my shoes  
My lipstick, my perfume  
Sleeping with my husband  
What was that?  
They say your life changes  
When you have kids  
Bring it way down, Gill  
You know your life doesn't change, it ends

Blue Jean
David Bowie
----------------
Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean  
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money  
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em  
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean  
She got a police bike  
She got a turned up nose  
  
Sometimes I feel like  
(Oh, the whole human race)  
Jazzin' for Blue Jean  
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)  
Blue Jean can send me  
(Oh, somebody send me)  
Somebody send me  
(Oh, somebody send me)  
  
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter  
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together  
Remember that everybody has to wait in line  
Blue Jean, look out world you know I've got mine  
She got Latin roots  
She got everything.

Home Improvement
George Strait
----------------
The walls that surround us are slowly crumblin' down  
But the heart of this foundation is still on solid ground  
Just need some renovation and a lot of TLC  
And a long night of lovin' is all that we both need  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone  
If the door bell rings  
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement  
  
Every day we go our separate ways  
To make our dreams come true  
But it ain't worth the sacrifice  
If we're giving up me and you  
We gotta hold on tighter than tight  
To the lies that make us strong  
And get back to the roots  
That made this house a home  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone  
If the door bell rings  
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone  
If the door bell rings  
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement

My Insatiable One
Morrissey
----------------
In the high life, I've got this feeling now  
I've got this horrible feeling  
On the escalator, they took it out on him  
As the ridiculous world went by  
  
Oh, he's gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh ...  
  
  
On the high wire, dressed in a leotard  
There wobbles one hell of a retard  
On the escalator, you shit paracetamol  
As the ridiculous world goes by  
  
  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh ...  
  
  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
And he was my inflatable one  
Oh ...

Drunk Tongue
Wu-Tang Clan
----------------
I don't give a damn!  
I'll kill anyone in my way  
  
Homicide city shit  
Homicide city shit  
Yeah yeah, homicide, yo  
You see the neck lit, fist glisten, chain drippin', lane shiftin'  
Riding dirty dirty, got that thang, know I stay grippin'  
Facin' life with it or without it bitch it's same difference  
Lames drippin' if it's day or night, I'ma bang with it  
Situation's sickenin' niggas broke, and they can't fix it  
Dough is all I know so if you slip it, then I can't miss it  
Ain't mention Sin and broke niggas, in the same sentence  
Got the game twisted, mayne listen, say pimpin'  
What you pushin'? Product pumpin' like a piston hardly gettin' by  
Or probably gettin' high off what you pitchin', while we sittin' fly  
Tryin' to keep it simplified, movin' like we Semper Fi  
My niggas is born to ride, y'all niggas get sent to die  
All you do is mention I, general exemplify  
Sin City been gritty, ten city enterprise  
About to make it twenty-five, utilize my witty mind  
And improvise my goal to reach the, all-time city high  
You don't want the semi flyin' nine at your Hemi fine  
All you gotta do is send me mine, you got plenty time  
Mad 'cause my ones up, and scared 'cause my guns bust  
God's mind is divine, I'll shine on you dumb fucks  
Sin never dumbstruck, dram'n on the dump pumps  
Hit any man in the face they're like, sanitation dump trucks  
Dodge magnum chunks up, big enough to slug thugs out  
The bubble butts hop off the cots to play double dutch  
Glock in a double clutch, you don't want no trouble trust  
Rug cutter you're jugular, promise you your blood'll gush  
Dead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us  
Your back ledge, you rats feds can't front like you one of us  
Stack bread like Wonder from the winter 'til the summer come  
Upgrade to made, that's when the Benzs and the Humers come  
I ain't want no Humer stunt, ask how I stack well like Maxwell  
Nigga tryin' do a little some'n some'n

What Now My Love
Andy Williams
----------------
What now, my love  
Now that you've left me  
How can I live  
Through another day  
Watching my dreams  
Turn into ashes  
And my hopes  
Into bits of clay  
Once I could see  
Once I could feel  
Now I am numb  
I've become unreal  
I walk the night  
Oh without a goal  
Stripped of my heart  
And my soul  
What now, my love  
Now that it's over  
I feel the world  
Closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And there's the sky  
Where the sea should be  
What now, my love  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool  
To go on and on  
No one would care  
No one would cry  
If I should live  
If I should die  
What now, my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last  
My last goodbye

Abattoir Blues
Nick Cave
----------------
The sun is high up in the sky and I'm in my car  
Drifting down into the abattoir  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
The air grows heavy. I listen to your breath  
Entwined together in this culture of death  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
Slide on over here, let me give you a squeeze  
To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory  
Can you hear what I hear, babe?  
Does it make you feel afraid?  
  
Everything's dissolving, babe, according to plan  
The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land  
I went to bed last night and my  
Moral code got jammed  
I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand  
  
I kissed you once. I kissed you again  
My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange  
Do you feel what I feel, dear?  
  
Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy  
These things are not good for me  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
The line the God throws down to you and me  
Makes a pleasing geometry  
Shall we leave this place now, dear?  
Is there someway out of here?  
  
I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work  
The need for validation, babe, gone completely  
Berserk  
I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out such a  
Jerk  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
Right down to my shoes

Blue Moon
Rod Stewart
----------------
(feat. Eric Clapton)  
  
Once upon a time before I took up smiling  
I hated the moonlight  
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling  
Seemed flat as the noonlight  
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten  
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men  
  
Blue moon  
You saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon  
You know just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own  
Now I have a girl of my own

Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)  
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch  
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)

Go For Yourself
Van Morrison
----------------
Hey, where you gonna go for yourself?  
I think you should go for yourself.  
I think you should go for yourself this time.  
I think this time you should go for yourself.  
I think you should go for yourself this time.  
This time I think you should go down funky Broadway.  
Oh, baby, baby.  
Baby, I want to get a job down funky Broadway.  
Go for yourself.  
Go for yourself.  
Go for yourself.  
Go for yourself baby.  
Go for yourself.  
I think you should go for yourself.  
Go for yourself.

On Every Street
Dire Straits
----------------
There's gotta be a record of you someplace  
You gotta be on somebody's books  
The lowdown, a picture of your face  
Your injured looks  
The sacred and profane  
The pleasure and the pain  
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A ladykiller, regulation tattoo  
Silver spurs on his heels  
Says, what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you  
She threw herself under my wheels  
Oh it's a dangerous road  
And a hazardous load  
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street  
  
A three-chord symphony crashes into space  
The moon is hanging upside down  
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case  
It's a ravenous town  
And you still refuse to be traced  
Seems to me such a waste  
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

The Kid's Grown Up
Leo Sayer
----------------
Southdown motor co  
2a bus  
You can see right inside  
My parent's house  
Sitting at the table and my dinner's up  
It's gonna be different when  
The kid's grown up  
Gonna save some money  
And quit this job  
Light the way  
Clear the stage  
The kid's grown up  
Used to play in the underground  
Hyde park  
Now I'm riding in a limousine  
Through the underpass  
I'm sitting in an aeroplane  
It's all such a rush  
People all around me making  
So much fuss  
And I've got a little money  
But it ain't gonna burn me up  
If I'm in your town  
Tonight I am -- watch out  
The kid's grown up

Misery
P!nk
----------------
Shadows are fallin' all over town  
Another night and these blues got me down  
Oh, misery! I sure could use some company  
Since he's been gone I ain't been the same  
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain  
Guess it's all meant to be  
For love to cause me misery  
  
Oh misery! Oh misery!  
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me  
Seems it's my destiny  
For love to cause me misery  
  
And, oh! I've been down this road before  
With a passion that turns into pain  
And each I saw love walk out the door  
I swore never get caught again  
  
But ain't it true? It takes what it takes  
And sometime we get too smart too late  
One more heartache for me  
Another night of misery  
  
Oh! And oh misery! Oh misery!  
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me  
Oh misery! Oh misery!  
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this  
Heart make a fool of me  
Seems it's my destiny  
For love to cause misery, oh  
Misery  
Guess it's all meant to be  
For love to cause me misery, oh, no, yeah  
Misery

I Never Cry
Alice Cooper
----------------
If there is a tear on my face  
It makes me shiver to the bones  
It shakes me, Babe  
It's just a heartache that got in my eye  
And you know I never cry, I never cry  
Sometimes I drink more than I need  
Until the TV's dead and gone  
I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
And the night may pass me by  
But I'll never cry  
Take away, take away my eyes  
Sometimes I'd rather be blind  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
Open it up but don't you leave it alone  
'cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried  
And you know I'll never cry  
And you know I'll never cry  
And you know I'll never cry  
Never cry, I'll never cry  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
'cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried  
And you know I'll never cry  
Never cry  
I'll never cry

A Place Where We Belong
Air Supply
----------------
I'm just a wandering gypsy  
I'll sing for you tonight  
And when the seats are empty  
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight  
And I'll be in the place where I belong  
  
For who will tell the story  
Except someone like me  
Of tragedy and glory  
Of lovers as they walk so blindly  
And try to find a place where they belong  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
Everybody knows me  
Everone shows me  
And I'll be here when you have gone  
For the road to carry on  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
If destiny has spoken  
If finally the dawn has broken  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
I'm just a wandering gypsy  
I've sung for you tonight  
And now the seats are empty  
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight  
And I'll be in the place where I belong

My Heart Will Go On
Neil Diamond
----------------
Every night in my dreams  
I see you, I feel you  
That is how I know you go on  
Far across the distance  
And spaces between us  
You have come to show you go on  
Near, far, wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more, you opened the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
Love can touch us one time  
And last for a lifetime  
And never let go till we're gone  
Love was when I loved you  
One true time to hold to  
In my life we'll always go on  
Near, far, wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more, you opened the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
You're here  
There's nothing I fear  
'Cause I know that my heart  
Will go on and on  
And on and on and on  
My heart will go on and on

I Lay Down And Die
Bee Gees
----------------
Only last night when your arms held me tight  
you told me you thought our love could last forever, forever  
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought  
that our love could last forever, forever  
  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
And everyone cries as teardrops begin  
I lay down and die  
And when darkness falls  
can't seem right there at all  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
  
I lay down and die.  
The teardrops begin.  
I lay down and die.  
And die.  
And die.  
I lay down and die.  
  
The whole world joins in  
I lay down and die and the teardrops begin  
I lay down and die and I lay down and die

Running For Our Lives
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
Move along staying close to the wall  
Looking over your shoulder just in time.  
Avoid the light, close your eyes  
And put your hand in mine.  
And put your hand in mine.  
  
Are we in danger, or is it that  
You think we might be ?  
But I think I'd like to get out of here,  
This place it frightens me,  
This place it frightens me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Running for our lives,  
At least we're pretending we are.  
Running for our lives,  
We never get very far. [Repeat: x3]  
  
Stop pretending  
This is a child's adventure,  
The only way I can take it  
Is playing the game.  
  
Be quiet, there's a gate ahead.  
Do you think we can make it ?  
Will it be different, or just the same ?  
How long can we keep escaping [Repeat: x3]  
Into another prison ?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Move along staying close to the wall,  
Looking over your shoulder just in time.  
Avoid the light, close your eyes  
And put your hand in mine  
And put your hand in mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We never get very far. [Repeat: x3]  
We never get

Step Into These Shoes
Howard Jones
----------------
Step into these shoes feel this heart  
Step into these shoes they might fit you  
See through these eyes might be the same view  
If I'd lived through the same things as you  
I'd share the laughs, and cry the tears that you do  
Chorus  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Look into m mind it might fit you  
Act out this part is it so different to you  
Even if we don't ever agree  
The only difference is cosmetically  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step in step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Just feel my heart it beats with you  
We float downstream in the same canoe  
You might find the ocean faster than me  
But I'll see it eventually  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Oh feel this heart please feel it  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart oh feel  
This heart please feel it  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step in step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight anymore  
Feel this heart oh feel it  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight

Firework
Katy Perry
----------------
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind  
Wanting to start again  
  
Do you ever feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards  
One blow from caving in  
  
Do you ever feel already buried deep  
Six feet under screams  
But no one seems to hear a thing  
  
Do you know that there's still a chance for you  
'Cause there's a spark in you  
  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em falling down down down  
  
You don't have to feel like a waste of space  
You're original, cannot be replaced  
If you only knew what the future holds  
After a hurricane comes a rainbow  
  
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed  
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road  
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow  
And when it's time, you'll know  
  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe-awe-awe  
  
Boom, boom, boom  
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon  
And it's always been inside of you you you  
And now it's time to let it through  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe

Footloose
Kenny Loggins
----------------
I've been working so hard  
I'm punching my card  
Eight hours for what?  
Oh, tell me what I got  
I've got this feeling  
That time's just holding me down  
I'll hit the ceiling or else  
I'll tear up this town  
  
Now I gotta cut loose  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose  
  
You're playing so cool, obeying every rule  
Dig a way down in your heart  
You're burning yearning for some  
Somebody to tell you that life ain't passing you by  
I'm trying to tell you  
It will if you don't even try  
You'll get by if you'd only  
  
Cut loose, footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Ooh-wee Marie shake it, shake it for me  
Woah, Milo come on, come on let's go  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose  
  
You got to turn me around and put your  
Feet on the ground, now take the hold of all  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
I'm turning you loose  
  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose (footloose)  
  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues,  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut footloose

Tora! Tora! Tora!
Depeche Mode
----------------
They were raining from the sky  
Exploding in my heart  
Is this a love in disguise  
Or just a form of modern art  
  
From the skies you could almost hear them cry  
Tora Tora Tora  
In the town they were going down  
Tora Tora Tora  
  
I had a nightmare only yesterday  
You played a skeleton  
You took my love then died that day  
I played an American  
  
From the skies you can almost hear them cry  
Tora! Tora! Tora!  
In the town they were going down  
Tora! Tora! Tora!  
  
I played an American

When You Wish Upon A Star
Billy Joel
----------------
When a star is born, they receive a gift or two  
One of them is this, they have the power to make a dream come true  
  
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires will come to you  
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind she brings to those who love  
Love's sweet fulfillment of their secret longing  
  
Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true  
  
Ooh, like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and I sees you through  
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true, ooh, ooh

The Turning Point
Toto
----------------
I went down to the highway  
That runs between love and pride  
And I tried to get sideways  
Across the great divide  
But my mind's eye's on the key ring  
Crying in misery  
'Cause it won't spend one more evening  
Staring back at me.  
  
It may be by choice or a small inner voice I can't say  
When you add up the cost we all have a cross  
How do you write off the loss?  
  
Where do I go from here?  
How do I find my way?  
When is it loud and clear  
That there's no turning back? No looking back  
Where do I go from here?  
Nobody gets away  
It''s a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know what's coming next, at the turning point.  
  
The rules are unwritten  
And nobody knows the deal  
Where have I been driven  
Are deamons behind the wheel?  
Yeah, I know my days are numbered  
We're only flesh and bone  
And I've been left to wonder  
How it went so wrong.  
  
Is it all tailor made, can the sinner be saved, I can't say  
So don't hang your hat on the knife I'm my back  
'Cause nobody treats me like that.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
How do I find my way?  
When is it loud and clear  
That there's no turning back? No looking back  
Where do I go from here?  
Nobody gets away  
It''s a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know what's coming next, at the turning point.

Hard Luck Story
Elton John
----------------
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy  
Staring at the same four walls  
Waiting for the working day to end  
Then I get home so wasted, worn out  
I curse at you and tell you  
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men  
How I've struggled for my money  
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah  
Well I'm tired of it honey  
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while  
  
All you hear are hard luck stories  
And the ways I look at life  
And the way I think the world treats me  
And the way that I treat my wife  
  
I never seem to look at you  
And see that somewhere underneath  
A pair of tired eyes are crying out  
Well you know I work hard all day long  
Let me kiss you once with meaning  
Just to kill this nagging doubt  
Well you don't deny I do you proud  
And you expect me to be tired  
You say there's no future in our lives  
While I persist I'm putting out the fire  
  
All you hear are hard luck stories  
Just a few well chosen words  
'Cause you're still the woman of a working man  
You've got the heart of a working girl

Stardust
Nat King Cole
----------------
And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadows of my heart  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
The lonely night dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
Now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

Killer's Remorse
Xzibit
----------------
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry I met you  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm sorry I killed you  
I'm sorry I murked you  
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me  
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me  
I wish I could go back to where we began  
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again  
I wish we had more paths to cross  
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss  
My killer's remorse  
  
For me we are the same should be laughed at  
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked  
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back  
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that  
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath  
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left  
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately  
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately  
I'm so christian I'm so muslim  
Super size on your mom trigger get push up  
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking  
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is
coked  
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you  
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off  
I said memories fade just as blood washes off  
Hope to see you soon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel so guilty my hands are filthy  
From decorating your face all over the building  
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear  
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here  
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam  
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam  
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie  
We smoked you like the weed in the bong  
  
Have you ever seen the bloodstain  
And know that person has returned from every once came  
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain  
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing  
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game  
You're still dead when I'm still alive  
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Started the bullshit escalated to violence  
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence  
Now I feel empty not even existing  
My worst enemy is no longer against me  
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me  
And you felt the same thing but never could move me  
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies  
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving  
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense  
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards  
The dirt on your casket  
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out  
And I just sold out and wait for the contact  
And life for the combat and now we be on that  
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now  
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down  
  
[Chorus]

How Big Is God
Hank Snow
----------------
Though men may strife to go  
Beyond the reap of space  
To walk beyond the distance shining stars  
This world's a room so small  
Within my master's house  
The open sky's but a portion of his yard  
How big is God how big and wide is his domain  
To try to tell these lips can only start  
He's big enough to rule the mighty universe  
Yet small enough to live within my heart  
  
As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to fall  
To lie asleep till wake by summer's rain  
The heart grown cold will warm  
And trod with life anew  
The Master's touch will bring the glow again  
How big is God

You're Made That Way
Doobie Brothers
----------------
Who are you  
Where you been  
How'd you come into my life  
I just know once you get started  
Girl, I been throwin' my heart in  
You're just like walkin' in a danger zone  
A chance I just had to take  
You're like a drink I needed so bad and found  
If no one pulled my head back in time, I would drown  
Oh, I get lost in your eyes  
I crossed the line for you so long ago  
Now I find truth in your lies  
You got me cornered with my back to the wall  
Takes all I've got just to hold on  
Through all the disappointment  
Love still remains  
Darling, you're made that way  
Girl, you're made that way  
"You were just a lonely man  
Living through your empty plans"  
I know you're made that way  
I know you're made that way  
Say it please  
Say you will  
Come back and be in my life  
Girl, if you just put your heart in it  
No one could stop us once we get started  
Well, I get tired of living for your applause  
And putting my happiness in your hands  
Well, I don't know what you're expecting of me  
What you want for me to be, I will be  
I know you're made that way  
I know you're made that way

The Eagle Will Rise Again
Alan Parsons Project
----------------
And I could easily fall from grace  
Then another would take my place  
For the chance to behold your face  
  
As the days of my life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
At the call of the wind's command  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
  
All that I ask you  
Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
  
As the sun turns slowly around the sky  
Till the shadow of night is high  
The eagle will learn to fly  
  
As the days of his life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
And vanish upon the land  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
Show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
And so, with no warning, no last goodbye  
In the dawn of the morning sky  
The eagle will rise again

You Got It
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
Everytime I look  
Into your lovely eyes  
I see a love that money  
Just can't buy  
  
One look from you  
I drift away  
I pray that you  
Are here to stay  
  
Chorus  
Anything you want  
You got it  
Anything you need  
You got it  
Anything at all  
You got it  
Baby  
  
Everytime I hold you  
I begin to understand  
Everything about you  
Tells me I'm your best friend  
I live my life  
To be with you  
No one can do  
The things you do  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm glad to give  
My love to you  
I know you feel  
The way I do

Dazed And Confused
Nirvana
----------------
Been dazed and confused for so long  
It's not true,  
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.  
Lots of people talk and few of them know,  
Soul of a woman was created below.  
  
You hurt and abused telling all of your lies,  
Run arounds sweet baby lord how they hypnotize.  
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been,  
Gonna love you baby here I come again  
  
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay  
Try to love you baby but you push me away.  
Don't know where you're going only know just where you've been,  
Sweet little baby I want you again.  
  
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true,  
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.  
Take it easy baby let them say what they will.  
Won't hurt so much when I send you the bill

Crazy In Love
Eminem
----------------
Tell myself that I was doin' all right  
There's nothin' left to do tonight  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
Can't you see what you do to me baby,  
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac  
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick  
You're truly the only one who can do this to me  
You just make me get so crazy  
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic  
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit  
'Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We can't figure out if it's lust  
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch  
But I stay and still stick it out with you  
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it  
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just 'cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if there's one thing about you that I admire  
It's baby, because you stay with me  
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am  
'Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise  
You're always full of surprises  
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
You've always kept out of mine  
I wonder what's on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didn't see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral, the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do, and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter  
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable  
Is you're the legs to my table,  
If you were to break I'd fall on my face  
But I'm always gonna make you feel  
I don't need you as much as I really need you  
So you don't use it to your advantage  
But you're essential to me  
You're the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
I'd probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my Marshall  
You're the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my Eminem  
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that I'm lookin for  
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just won't come to my mind  
You're like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
You're like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough  
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go Crazy, crazy on you oh

Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me
George Michael
----------------
i can't light no more of your darkness  
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white  
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me  
Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
  
It's much too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life  
But you misread my meaning when i met you  
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  
  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
  
Ladies and gentlemen Mr. Elton John  
I can't find  
Oh, the right romantic line  
But see me once and see the way feel  
Don't discard me baby don't  
Just because you think i mean you harm  
Just because you think i mean you harm, oh  
But these cuts i have, cuts i have  
They need love  
They need love, they need love to help them heal  
  
Oh, don't let the sun go down on me  
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i that see, yeah  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh  
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Baby Mine
Kenny Loggins
----------------
Baby mine, don't you cry  
Baby mine, dry your eyes  
Rest your head close to my heart  
Never to part, baby of mine  
  
Little one when you play  
Don't you mind what they say  
Let those eyes sparkle and shine  
Never a tear, baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
They'd end up loving you too  
All those same people who scold you  
What they'd give just for  
The right to hold you  
  
From your head to your toes  
You're not much, goodness knows  
But you're so precious to me  
Cute as can be, baby of mine

Salesman
The Monkees
----------------
Salesman, where you gonna go?  
To sell all your of your goods today  
Salesman, gonna walk along the street, see friends along the way  
Well salesman, with your wooden cart that you push along while you walk  
Hey, salesman, got a little dog whose tail wags when you talk  
You always wear a smile, even though you've gotta walk ten miles  
Short lifespan, good time salesman  
Yep, yep salesman got it on the street, whether it's hot or cold  
It's salesman, well, you work real hard,  
Until every part is sold  
Salesman as the years go by,  
People changing every day  
Hey, salesman 'till the end of time you'll be livin' in the same way  
You always wear a smile, you love 'em fast and you live wild  
Short life span, but ain't life grand?  
  
Copper kettles, different kinds of tin  
There goes salesman and he's sailing high again  
He's sailing so high, high, sailing so high  
  
Salesman where you gonna go to sell all of your goods today  
Yup, salesman, gonna walk along the street, see friends along the way  
Hey, salesman, with your wooden cart that you push along while you walk  
Hey, salesman with your secret goods that you push while you talk  
You always wear a smile,  
Even though you've gotta walk a hundred ten miles  
Short life span but the whole thing's grand  
Salesman  
  
Now, well, I tried the one that you put it in and you have to do it  
Manually. But I'd like the one that you just plug it in and it does it all  
By itself in a real long strand and you cut 'em up. It's easier to do it  
That way because, well, I put all the stuff in there and it keeps flippin'  
Out. And I can't get the thing to stick together anything. Coupled with  
The fact that I have to stick two of them together to even get on out of it  
And they always end up lookin' like Lucky Strikes.

Reaching Out
Lea Salonga
----------------
What must I do, to make you understand  
You mean everything to me  
Don't have the strength to say, give this heart of mine a chance  
Maybe then you will see  
I'll do anything, do anything, that you tell me  
I'll be there, I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Reaching out to you, do you feel it to  
Loving you is all I want to do  
I'm completely sure, I've never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
What must I do, so I can make you see  
The light that shines in my eyes  
You brighten up my day  
You even help me find my way  
I wish your always by my side  
  
And I can't stop, don't know how to stop, thinking of you  
And i'll do anything, do anything, to be near you  
Reaching out to you do you feel it to  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure, never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
Reaching out to you, do you feel it to  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure, never felt this way before  
Deep inside you know that there is something more  
Deep inside you know that there is something more

Never Is A Long Time
Roxette
----------------
You build it up and tear it down, there's no reason to follow you.  
You left the song without a sound, you left the story I made for you.  
Softly angels bow and cry in the stillness of the night.  
  
Never is a long time - goodbye.  
No answers for the asking.  
It's a long time - goodbye.  
No mercy for the aching.  
It's a long time - oh I see no light on the forsaken.  
Never is a long time - goodbye.  
Let's spend the night when this dream has come to an end.  
  
Sometimes you laugh,  
Sometimes you cry, and yes,  
I've cried over you.  
You've left me blind in paradise.  
You've left me hungering for the touch of you.  
Snow white angels run and hide in the blackness of the night.  
  
Never is a long time...

A Whole New World
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
I can show you the world,  
Shining, shimmering, splendid,  
Tell me, princess, now when did  
You last let your heart decide?  
  
I can open your eyes,  
Take you wonder by wonder,  
Over, sideways and under,  
On a magic carpet ride  
  
A whole new world,  
A new fantastic point of view,  
No one to tell us no,  
Or where to go,  
Or say we're only dreaming  
  
A whole new world,  
A dazzling place I never knew,  
But when I'm way up here,  
It's crystal clear,  
That now I'm in a whole new world with you  
  
Now I'm in a whole new world with you  
  
Unbelievable sights,  
Indescribable feeling,  
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling,  
Through an endless diamond sky  
  
A whole new world

Endless Love
Mariah Carey
----------------
My love  
There's only you in my life  
The only thing that's right  
My first love  
You're every breath I take  
You're every step I make  
  
And I  
I want to share  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)  
They tell me how much you care  
Oh, yes  
You'll always be  
My endless love  
  
Two hearts  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
And forever  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms  
  
And I  
I'd play the fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
(No, you know I don't mind)  
And yes  
You mean the world to me  
I know I've found in you  
My endless love  
  
And love  
I'd play the fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
(Whoa, you know I don't mind)  
Oh, yes  
You'd be the only one  
'Cause no, I can't deny  
This love I have inside  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love (my love, my love)

I Need A Doctor
Underworld
----------------
In the morning  
Radio jingles  
Drive me mental  
Turning my blood into water (yeah)  
  
Hear the shallow -  
Conversation  
From the station  
Sugar cube a generation (yeah!)  
  
But aah would you take me home?  
Aah - would you know what to do -  
When we got there?  
Aah - may I use your phone?  
I need my mother!  
  
(So) Educate me  
Radio ego  
I will follow  
But what will I find tomorrow (well?)  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah to the little white hospital -  
In my head  
Aah - may I use your phone  
I need my mother?!  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah would you know what to do -  
When we got there?  
Aah - may I use your phone  
I need a doctor!

Still
Rush
----------------
Trick of the light  
Or just  
A loss of perspective  
Flaw in the grand plan  
Just  
The way it is  
  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It...  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But I've got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirit's released  
But I've got to get there  
  
Lost in an abstract thought  
Dazed and distracted  
Winded yet still I'm caught  
With a fragment of doubt  
Slowed by reflection  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But I've got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirit's released  
But I've got to get there  
  
It's just confusion  
An illusion  
Easily overdone  
Here comes resolution  
Absolution  
  
It's not an illusion  
Not a fiction  
Easily overcome  
Here comes revolution  
Absolution  
  
Trick of the light  
Or just  
Too much perspective  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still

Basement Kiss
Elvis Costello
----------------
Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road  
For in Belgravia  
Rumors have been whispered and suggestions have been made  
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense?  
You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense  
You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?  
  
Who's that sneaking 'round the door?  
You can't come here no more  
Can't you go home again?  
She used to sit alone for hours  
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers  
  
When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed  
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head  
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead  
  
Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat  
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that  
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes  
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom  
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers  
  
Why were you so tardy putting up your guard?  
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?

Goodbye
Avril Lavigne
----------------
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye, my love  
  
I can't hide  
Can't hide  
Can't hide what has come  
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go  
And leave you alone  
  
But always know, always know, always know  
That I love you so  
I love you so  
I love you so, oh  
  
Goodbye, brown eyes  
Goodbye for now  
Goodbye, sunshine  
Take care of yourself  
  
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go  
And leave you alone  
But always know, always know, always know  
That I love you so,  
I love you so, oh  
I love you so, oh  
  
La lullaby  
Distract me with your eyes  
La lullaby  
la lullaby  
Help me sleep tonight  
  
La lullaby (la lullaby, la lullaby)  
I have to go  
I have to go  
I have to go  
And leave you alone  
  
But always know, always know, always know  
That I love you so  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
I love you so  
I love you so  
I love you so  
  
Goodbye, brown eyes  
Goodbye my love

Jump
Flo-Rida
----------------
[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]  
When I say jump, you say how high  
I ain't never seen nobody, how they get so high  
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane  
This party got me insane, so jump jump jump jump  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Now I'm gon take it to the roof  
Everybody with me got they own parachute  
You ain't scared of heights when you sipping on Goose  
Party all night like I'm flying jet new?  
You ain't never seen nobody get this loose  
Shawty acting naughty with her body, what it do  
Jump to this man, bump to this man  
Stomp to this man, crunk to this man  
Got another hit man  
Hold up, I wanna go up, don't wanna throw up  
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us  
Dance, the boy got us all feeling high  
Ask, the shawty, I'm a astronaut  
High rollin baby like I'm jumping on fire  
Super Bowl pimp good Year on tire  
Can I be a bird, I gotta be fly  
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there  
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air  
Up up and away take it off like mere?  
NBA balling, I don't care  
Now what do you do when you see you a shawty and she make it bounce in the
room?  
Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady, can I get on your hot air
balloon?  
Sky high, still clubbing like I'm part of the mile high  
Ears popping, Bubbalicious help me get right  
Keep popping in position after midnight  
Moese? fried chicken up in NY  
Jigga what, don't it feel good  
Houston? We gonna jump ship, all aboard  
Come around me, and we'll parlay, we're throwed?  
Cali is jumping, hit the switch on the 6 4  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Come on and jump, jump, jump [Repeat: x3]  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down  
(All the fellas) jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
(All the fellas, the ladies, the fellas, the ladies, let me see you)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down

There For You
Leonard Cohen
----------------
When it all went down  
And the pain came through  
I get it now  
I was there for you  
Don't ask me how  
I know it's true  
I get it now  
I was there for you  
I make my plans  
Like I always do  
But when I look back  
I was there for you  
I walk the streets  
Like I used to do  
And I freeze with fear  
But I'm there for you  
I see my life  
In full review  
It was never me  
It was always you  
You sent me here  
You sent me there  
Breaking things  
I can't repair  
Making objects  
Out of thoughts  
Making more  
By thinking not  
Eating food  
And drinking wine  
A body that  
I thought was mine  
Dressed as Arab  
Dressed as Jew  
O mask of iron  
I was there for you  
Moods of glory  
Moods so foul  
The world comes through  
A bloody towel  
And death is old  
But it's always new  
I freeze with fear  
And I'm there for you  
I see it clear  
I always knew  
It was never me  
I was there for you  
I was there for you  
My darling one  
And by your law  
It all was done

Wasting Time
Hanson
----------------
Then I saw your face  
Suddenly I'm losing faith, yea  
The words are few to place  
Give up, give out, giving no big disgrace, yea  
  
Let's stop wasting time  
Let's stop wasting time  
  
Say your mind  
But you can tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Let's stop wasting time  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
  
Let me in your heart  
Give up, give out, giving is where it starts, yea  
Dreaming's not so hard  
Once you've found your shooting star, yea  
  
Let's stop wasting time  
Let's stop wasting time  
  
Say your mind  
But you can tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Let's stop wasting time  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
  
Oh, yea  
  
Tell me if I'm in, in over my head  
Tell me if our future is just hanging by a thread  
I don't want to begin something I can't face  
If I'm destined for loneliness tell me on my way  
On my way  
  
Tell me I'm out of my head  
Tell me I'm out of my head  
No, don'tcha tell me I'm out of my head  
I'm out of my head  
  
  
Oh, Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Let's stop wasting time  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head

Just What I Needed
Poison
----------------
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near  
I kinda lose my mind, yeah  
It's not the perfume that you wear  
It's not the ribbons in your hair  
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess you're just what I needed  
(Just what I needed)  
I needed someone to feed  
I guess you're just what I needed  
(Just what I needed)  
I needed someone to bleed  
  
I don't mind you hangin' out  
And talkin' in your sleep  
It doesn't matter where you've been  
As long as it was deep, yeah  
You always knew to wear it well and  
You look so fancy I can tell  
I don't mind you hangin' out  
And talkin' in your sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near  
I kinda lose my mind, yeah  
It's not the perfume that you wear  
It's not the ribbons in your hair  
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time

Between The Hammer And The Anvil
Judas Priest
----------------
Storm warning  
But there's no fear  
Lies forming  
The sacrament lays bare  
The sinner  
Will testify  
They'll suffer  
When sacrificed on high  
The burning sermons purge their evil words  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Force rises  
False rituals  
Baptises  
The body and the soul  
Our union  
Their fall from grace  
Confession (confess your sins)  
Will seal them to their fate  
The burning sermons will survive their curse  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Transgression  
They prey on grief  
Our mission  
To purify belief  
This altar  
Gives power and light  
They'll falter  
While we are shining bright  
The burning sermons consecrate their sin  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Storm warning  
But there's no fear

If I Cried Every Time You Hurt Me
Wanda Jackson
----------------
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time  
If I made a scene each time you were mean we'd be quarrellin' all the time  
But I don't cry and I don't get mad I try to take the good with the bad  
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time  
  
[Strings]  
  
Now and then you say you love me I try to believe you do  
Then you turn right around and hurt me like I was nothing to you  
But I love you so and I'll stay somehow my tears won't flow and my head won't
bow  
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time

Only A Boy
Rod Stewart
----------------
Single file in the girls corridor  
Come along, Stewart laddie!  
  
Stewart boy, you'll never be much,  
'cause you're too busy acting the fool.  
Thank you Sir for them few kind words,  
On my last day of school.  
  
Oh, but my mama said, I could be a success,  
If I'd only get myself out of bed.  
Words of wisdom, but I wasn't listening,  
I had plans in my head.  
  
Only a boy,  
Trying it on,  
Coming on strong,  
Restless to roam,  
Only a boy,  
Silly and proud,  
Reckless and loud,  
Impressing the crowd,  
Only a boy.  
  
Rock'n' Roll was in my brain,  
Eddie Cochrane running through my brain.  
Skin tight trousers in council houses,  
The unemployment exchange.  
  
The blues I played were Mississippi made  
And ev'ry Friday night I'd fall in love.  
Football fields and teenage pills  
Nothing's enough.  
  
Only a boy,  
Dressing to kill,  
Passion to spill,  
Hand in the till.  
Only a boy,  
Slipping it in,  
Thin as a pin,  
Chasing a dream,  
Only a boy.  
  
Climb down off the school roof laddie  
  
Oh and them dukes of freedom, I used to believe them,  
And all their rebelious vows.  
The critics, the cynics, who never understood it,  
Where are they now?  
  
And all the wondering and the stumbling  
That goes hand in hand with change.  
The yearning, the earning was it all part of learning,  
Or am I still the same?  
  
Only a boy  
Laughing aloud,  
Quick as a shot,  
Nobody can stop.  
Only a boy,  
Plans of his own,  
Leaving his home,  
Knows where he's going,  
Only a boy.  
  
Only a boy,  
Only a boy,  
Only a boy, ha ha, oh

Now That I Know Love
Kenny Loggins
----------------
How do I know if I'm in love?  
Who could I ever learn to trust?  
I asked myself these questions for so long  
What do I only wish to see?  
What do I truly know to be?  
I told myself to hold on tight  
You never know enough  
But now I see what I believe  
'Cause I'm believin' love  
  
[Chorus]  
Whether my mind's sayin' it's crazy  
Whether my world's sayin' I'm wrong  
Wherever my heart goes, that's where I belong  
I finally found out what faith is  
I follow the way that it feels  
And heaven has never been more real  
  
When you looked into me  
And you laid your hands on me  
At once the deaf could hear  
The blind could see  
Now that I Know Love  
  
I was a child alone, asleep  
You came along and cradled me  
You took me in your arms  
And rocked me so sweetly  
I'd prayed for love  
To come to pass  
How do we know if love will last?  
And if it can't then someone tell me  
What we're livin' for  
I don't know what tomorrow holds  
But I know what I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Glory be, I believe  
Oh I finally see that love isn't blind  
'Cause I've never seen more clearly in my life  
Now that I Know Love

Greenfields
Faith No More
----------------
Greenfields  
(The Brothers Four)  
Once there were greenfields...kissed by the sun  
Once there were valleys...where rivers used to run  
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above  
Once they were part of an everlasting hope  
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields  
Greenfields are gone now...parched by the sun  
Gone from the valleys...where rivers used to run  
Gone with the cold wind that swept through to my heart  
Gone with the lovers who let the dreams depart  
Where are the greenfields where we...used to roam?  
I'll never know what made you run away  
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?  
I only know there's nothing here for me  
Nothing is now left for me to say  
But I keep on waiting...until you return  
I keep on waiting until the day you learn  
You can't be happy when your heart's on the roam  
You can't be happy until you bring it home  
Home to the greenfields...and bleed once again (?)

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Carpenters
----------------
Christmas future is far away  
Christmas past is past  
Christmas present is here today  
Bringing joy that will last  
  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now

I Don't Know Your Name
Indigo Girls
----------------
Emily:  
I walked into my favorite place one night  
Id just gotten back from a lecture  
And I was feeling kind of uptight  
And at the edge of the bar there was this guy  
And you know I wasnt really looking  
But I caught him out of the corner of my eye  
The next thing I know he was moving my way  
I thought he wanted to talk  
But this is what he had to say  
  
Amy:  
I don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Yall sing it with me  
I don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Your lover your lover your lover  
One time or another baby  
I want to be your lover  
  
Emily:  
I have to admit I was a little bit surprised  
But I wasnt really scared cause I was twice his size  
So I said to myself, okay, Ill play his game  
And when he turned to me  
I gave him my name  
  
Amy:  
I know your name babe  
But I got to know your number  
I know your name babe  
But I got to know your number your number  
I said one time or another baby  
I'm gonna be your lover  
Yeah I wanna be your lover  
  
Emily:  
Well I said to myself this guy is persistent  
Hes a little bit dumb but at least hes consistent  
I tried to talk cool but when we touched I went under  
I made a quick decision and I gave him my number  
  
Amy:  
I know your number  
But I don't know what to say babe  
  
Emily:  
That's ok  
  
Amy:  
I know your number  
Your number babe  
But I don't know what to say to you  
Say to you say to you say to you darling  
Oh it don't matter anyway no  
I don't talk when I'm make love to you babe  
I don't talk when I make love  
I wanna be you lover  
I wanna be you lover  
Lover lover  
Lover lover  
Lover lover  
  
Emily:  
Well you probably wont believe this  
But we got married one day  
And I still don't know if he speaks english  
Cause he doesn't have much to say  
Its a damn good thing I like lying around  
We don't make much conversation  
But love makes sounds  
You know what I'm talking about  
Yall know what I'm talking about  
Well one thing I've learned from being in this state  
  
Emily and amy:  
There are other ways to communicate  
  
Amy:  
I don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Your lover your lover your lover  
One time or another baby  
I'm gonna be your lover

Don't Turn Around
Ace Of Base
----------------
If you want to leave  
I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling  
Maybe it's better that way  
I'm gonna be strong  
I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door  
Yea see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I won't miss your arms around me  
Holding me tight  
If you ever think about me  
Just know that I'll be alright  
I'm gonna be strong  
I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive  
Sure I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I wish I could scream out loud  
That I love you  
I wish I could say to you  
Don't go  
  
As he walks away he feels the pain  
Getting strong  
People in your life they don't know what's  
Going on  
Too proud to turn around he's gone  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know

Nine
Patti Smith
----------------
Night a nine of diamonds  
A woman lay and cries  
At the sister of Mercy  
On a Sabbath day  
Night a nine of diamonds  
As revelers commence  
To shiver as she bore  
In a babe, a radiance  
  
Brave in constant motion  
Wherein perfection brews  
Darkness as his brother  
Mischief as his moon  
Summoning beneath  
With his gypsy moves  
Yearning as the foal  
Shy and beautiful  
  
Every card he drew  
Had a different face  
Lingering and lost  
Unholy holy ghosts  
I tend to play them all  
He spoke with confidence  
Another kind of strange  
To shift in loneliness  
  
He sought not for himself  
The empire he would find  
Save the golden womb  
He enter in his mind  
  
We will die a littler  
The rogues whistling  
Nine blue-eyed sailors  
Tip their caps to him  
As he passes through them  
More vagabond than king  
With diamonds on his sleeves  
Like a harlequin

Resurrection
Misfits
----------------
Complications inside of me  
Reminds me that my heart won't always beat  
The ugly face of death that's smiling  
At my rotting teeth  
  
I will die here in this sorrow  
I was waiting for tomorrow  
Palpitate the pulse until  
You feel my heart explode against the wall  
  
Oh  
Talk about me  
Laugh about me  
Cry about me  
Nail me to the cross  
I'll be a martyr for the hated  
The weak, the ugly, the lost  
  
I will die here in this sorrow  
I won't wait for tomorrow  
Palpitate the pulse until  
You resurrect my soul from the wall  
  
Whoa  
Talk about me  
Laugh about me  
Cry about me  
Nail me to the cross  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
Whoa

Britney Spears

Verse 1:  
Hey Prince Charming  
You can kiss my ass  
I don't want cha or your fairy tales  
I want a Dark Night  
Who can rough me up  
Whose middle name is dangerous  
  
I don't want guarantees  
I don't want promises  
I just want a ride baby I'll never forget  
Got no expectations  
No need for a conversation  
Leave the drama out and just get right down to it

Verse 2:  
I'm talking damage  
With mystery  
I'll keep ya company tonight  
You bring the leather  
I'll bring the lace  
I'll wear it safe tonight  
I don't want future plans  
You can keep your romance  
You can give it to me baby  
Dying on ice  
We can make memories  
If you'll remember me  
You can have a shot  
Have a piece of lime

Old Habits Die Hard
Bon Jovi
----------------
You look like shit so dear my brother  
I missed you too, yeah you dumb stupid mother  
Jeep, welcome home sign, a bottle of red  
At least you got freedom in an open out there  
Free cheers till the best of the rest we got left  
  
If you could dream anything, what would that be?  
If you could dream back, would you share it with me?  
We carry our choices, we hide our regrets  
We know there's a price, we'll both pay our debts  
But maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet  
  
'Cause old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
There's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me  
Yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea  
I have your back for each day that's gone by  
And I'll still have it till the day that I die  
Yeah, I'll still have it till the day that I die  
  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
Some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind  
And I hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
Appearances change but don't change who we are  
And old habits die hard

Cheap Sunglasses
ZZ Top
----------------
When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt your head  
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed  
Is hit that streets a-runnin' and try to beat the masses  
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Spied a little thing and I followed her all night  
In a funky fine levis and her sweater's kind of tight  
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases  
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
(solo)  
  
Now go out and get yourself some big black frames  
With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name  
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes:  
Rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm On Automatic
Gary Numan
----------------
This is metal rhythm  
A new song on the Radio  
Some new face  
A picture on your wall  
Talk to me  
You say it's nothing personal  
But somethings wrong  
It's eating me alive  
I can't fine the reason  
So I can't find the cure  
They say nothings's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
I've never hurt like this  
I'm On Automatic  
I've heard it all before  
Some new flavour  
With nothing in the hear  
This isn't music  
This is survival  
But I'm still here  
Now isn't that strange  
I can't find the reason  
So I can't find the cure  
They say nothing's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
I've never hurt like this  
They say nothing's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
Nothing's ever hurt like this

Joan Of Arc
Madonna
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Each time they take the photograph  
I lose a part I can't get back  
I wanna hide  
This is the part where I detach  
Each time they write a hateful word  
Dragging my soul into the dirt  
I wanna die  
Never [?] hurts  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna talk about it right now  
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
But I'm in the dark, yeah  
I can't be superhero right now  
Even hearts made out of steel can break down  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
I'm only human  
Anything they did to me, said to me  
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not going down  
  
[Verse 2]  
One little lie can ruin my day  
Words are like weapons, they betray  
When I am afraid  
One word of kindness, it can save me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Being destructive is  
They couldn't say it to my face  
ONe day I won't care  
But for the moment I'm not there  
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
Anything they did to me, said to me  
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not Joan of Arc

Coupe De Ville
Neil Young
----------------
I got a Coupe De Ville  
I got a bed in the house  
Where you once lived.  
  
I had a few cheap thrills  
But they cost me a lot more  
Than I could give.  
  
I got a right in this crazy world  
To live my life like anyone else  
How long can I carry this monkey around  
All by myself.  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else.  
  
Well, I hit the wall  
Woke up this mornin'  
And I hit the wall.  
  
Yeah, I hit the wall  
Woke up this mornin'  
And I hit the wall.  
  
I got a right in this crazy world  
To live my life like anyone else  
How long can I carry this monkey around  
All by myself.  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nothin' else.

Good Man, Good Woman
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey  
Midnight, I'm wound up tight  
Slowly comin' down in the daytime  
I been lyin' low from work, hangin' over from the hurt from you babe  
But I'm gonna suffer through the strain, till I get a  
Better thing with you, Darlin', me and you.  
So far to see ahead  
When I can't seem to drag myself out of bed  
Gotta find me a good man, a good man, a good man.Yeah.  
You better stop, think about what you're saying  
I was seriously dedicated, in the game of playin'  
You made ten thousand promises you could'nt keep  
I forgave you when you lied, pleaded and weeped  
Put up with your disrespect and neglect  
What an experience, I'll never forget.  
Till now, everything I did was wrong. (I'm sorry, baby)  
Today you're free, but we live alone.  
Gotta find me a good woman...Good woman...Good woman...Yeah.  
It was twelve o'clock in the midnight hour  
I heard the door slam, and then the shower  
When I got up, you were already gone  
I slipped and fell, from the water you left on.  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man.

I Choose You
Tears For Fears
----------------
I knew all of this was coming  
Ain't that odd  
Some things come out of nothing  
As with god  
Not my intention to amuse  
Or confuse  
  
I've been down to the kitchen  
Played my part  
Mapped out all all contradictions  
Of the heart  
Then someone came and stole my shoes  
A situation I tried to diffuse  
  
Long way back clouds were forming  
If by choice  
Some things come as a warning  
Hear their voice  
I wish that I could change its hue  
Paint it blue  
But when I think what I could lose  
All other options disappear from view  
  
When I choose  
I choose you  
I choose you

Dreaming On A World
Tracy Chapman
----------------
I know I may be wishing  
On a world  
That may never be  
But I'll keep on wishing  
No matter how hopeless  
Or foolish  
It may seem  
I'll keep on wishing  
  
I'll toss my coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross my fingers and dream on  
I know I may be dreaming  
Of a world  
Far from present day reality  
But I'll keep on dreaming  
  
No matter how unrealistic  
Or naive  
It may seem  
Always keep dreaming  
And toss your coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross your fingers and dream on  
  
We must always be thinking  
Of a world  
As a place of infinite possibilities  
And always keep thinking  
No matter how hopeless  
Or foolish  
It may seem  
Always keep thinking  
  
And toss our coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross our fingers and dream on  
I'll keep on wishing  
We must always keep dreaming  
Of a world  
  
With equality and justice  
Thinking  
There could be a world  
Without poverty and sickness  
Wishing  
Of a world  
  
Without hunger and homelessness  
Dreaming  
Of a world  
Where all people live in peace  
Dreaming  
Of a world  
Dreaming  
On a world

The Bells Of St. Mary's
Vera Lynn
----------------
The bells of St. Mary's  
Ah! hear they are calling  
The young loves, the true loves  
Who come from the sea  
  
And so, my beloved  
When red leaves are falling  
The love bells shall ring out  
Ring out for you and me  
  
The bells of St. Mary's  
At sweet even time  
Shall call me, beloved  
To come to your side  
  
And out in the valley  
In sound of the sea  
I know you'll be waiting  
Yes, waiting for me  
  
At the porch of St. Mary's  
I'll wait there for you  
In your soft wedding dress  
With its ribbons of blue  
  
In the church of St. Mary's  
Sweet voices shall sing  
For you and me, dearest  
The wedding bells ring

Dark And Grey
Kid Rock
----------------
Fuck off  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it therrreee  
  
I never went to college, I ain't got no skills  
I got hair to my shoulders and a bottle of pills  
I got bills stacked up like a turkey club  
I blew my last dime drinkin at the local pub  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins  
I live, each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I'll pay  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it therrrreeee  
  
Rock, rock y'all  
(Rock y'all)  
To the beat y'all  
(Ah, to the beat y'all)  
Check it out y'all  
(Check it out y'all)  
You can't stop y'all  
(You can't stop y'all)  
Rock, rock y'all  
(Rock y'all)  
To the beat y'all  
(Ah, to the beat y'all)  
Check it out y'all  
(Check it out y'all)  
You come alive y'all  
(Alive y'all)  
Come on  
  
I never felt at home, although I grew up loved  
I got a junkies mind in a ramblin man's blood  
Got a flood full of thoughts that's caught in a dam  
Somedays I'm gone, but that's where I am  
I'm fit to slip another rippin rhyme  
I'm so ahead of the game, I feel left behind  
Another dime to boost, I got boots of lead  
Hope I live to see this virus spread  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins I live  
Each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I pay  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it there  
  
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I'm Forever Yours
Planetshakers
----------------
(Verse 1)  
I give my all to you  
Send me and I will go for you  
To the ends of the earth  
I'll follow after you  
I want the world to know  
Your love endures forever  
  
(Verse 2)  
Tell me and I'll obey  
This is far greater than sacrifice  
Trusting you and not myself  
Will always lead to blessing  
Lord have your way in me  
Not my will, yours be done  
  
(Chorus)  
Here I stand within your presence  
Longing for your touch  
A thousand days cannot compare  
To one day in your courts  
  
Hold me now  
And never ever let me go  
My jesus, my precious saviour  
I'm forever yours  
  
(Bridge)  
I will worship you forever  
I will worship you (5x)

For Veronica's Sake
Alice Cooper
----------------
I got a name and number  
I got a bed assigned  
I got a dog in the city pound  
that I left behind  
I'm strapped down and wild eyed  
she's locked up in a pen  
she needs somebody to feed her  
and i'm her only friend  
so for Veronica's sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronica's sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here  
We both been put in cages  
we got our shots and tags  
I got my sweating fist to shake  
she's got her tail to wag  
she has to bark and whimper  
while I can scream and shout  
the clock above the psycho ward  
says time is running out  
so for Veronica's sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronica's sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here  
And I can hear her howling all night  
at the lonely moon  
They're gonna give her the gas  
if I don't get there soon  
I gotta get there soon  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here  
for Veronica's sake she can get pretty weird  
for Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here.

Playing Possum
Carly Simon
----------------
We lived up here in Cambridge  
And browsed in the hippest newsstands  
The we started our own newspaper  
Gave the truth about Uncle Sam  
We loved to be so radical  
But like a ragged love affair  
Some became disenchanted  
And some of us just got scared  
  
Now are you playing possum  
Keeping a low profile  
Are you playing possum for a while  
  
Then you moved to the country  
Bought a farm and tilled the land  
Then you took your books to India  
And got hooked on a holy man  
But the wells they do run dry  
And the speeches turn to words  
And the woods are full of tigers  
And freedom's for the birds  
  
Now you run a bookstore  
And you've taken on a wife  
You wear patches on your elbows  
And you live an easy life  
But are you finally satisfied  
Is it what you were lookin' for  
Or does it sneak up on you  
That there might be something more

Rock N Roll Hero
Meat Loaf
----------------
I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll, when it didn't cost a thing  
Stacks of scratched up 45's and taught myself how to sing  
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king  
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, burnin' it up in a smoke filled club  
Givin' your soul to the world  
  
Chorus:  
  
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, a soldier of fortune in the night  
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, when the white hot lights cut through the night  
And the sound of the thunder starts roaring  
That's when you know what you're savin' it for  
And you're feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero  
  
I owe it all to rock 'n' roll, and I wouldn't want to change a thing  
Got this old guitar strapped round my neck, and my baby waitin' in the wings  
  
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king  
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, a spark in your eyes  
A flame in your soul, givin' it all to the world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Yes you're feeling like, oh you're feeling like  
  
(chorus)  
  
(Like a rock 'n' roll hero, like a rock 'n' roll hero)

Green And Gold
Eminem
----------------
What would it take to push a man,  
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life?  
What would drive someone completely over the edge  
To do some shit like that? the green and gold.  
  
I done filled my lungs up  
With so much of this crack smoke  
My necks bloated, my techs loaded,  
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off,  
Mad at the world I've had it with girls  
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop,  
Just made it and hopped on  
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on  
I spot JOHN a white collar worker  
In clean cut, walked up to em  
He was like what? whatchu mean what? you know what time it is man  
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band.  
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen  
A man holdin' a nine and then  
Shot him from the bottom up  
Stole his keys, put em inside the ignition and got em stuck,  
Hopped out to flee on my feet,  
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat

Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring
Josh Groban
----------------
Jesus, joy of man's desiring  
Holy wisdom, love most bright  
  
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring  
Soar to uncreated light  
  
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned  
With the fire of life impassioned  
Striving still to truth unknown  
Soaring, dying round Thy throne  
  
The original song continues with these words:  
Through the way where hope is guiding  
Hark, what peaceful music rings  
Where the flock, in Thee confiding  
Drink of joy from deathless springs  
Theirs is beauty's fairest pleasure  
Theirs is wisdom's holiest treasure  
Thou dost ever lead Thine own  
In the love of joys unknown)

I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Hey yo, baby, I know why you're here  
I know what you're doing  
I can see it in your eyes, you're up to somethin'  
I know what it is, but we're still cool  
And we can socialize, I'm peepin' ya, baby  
I'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go  
Cause a fool doesn't have a shoulder to cry on  
So give me a kiss and your service  
Whether you like a mister or a miss  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Baby, you're my dear, I know why you're here  
I know why you came, I know what you're thinkin'  
I know what you need, and that's what I've got  
You think I'm goin' crazy, no, I'm not drinking  
I know what you want, I made ya want it  
Take my hand, listen to the man  
You have a plan, don't even risk it  
What do you want, a biscuit?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Six minutes, six minutes  
Six minutes, six minutes  
(I ain't sayin' nothin')  
Six minutes, six minutes  
  
Honey, I know what you're up to, I know how you're livin'  
I know where you go when you leave my house  
I know what your dreams are, but I dream too  
You're with a man your, not with a mouse  
I see how you stare, I see how you smile  
I see right through, now act like you knew  
I know all about where you been runnin'  
Wipe your feet before you come in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, that's smooth, let's just sit here and relax  
While my man plays the piano for us  
Sip somethin' mellow  
And it's us while you're here  
But of course I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Okay, now that you know I know you know that I know you know  
And that's the move, so sit right here  
Whisper in my ear, caress my chest  
And say somethin' smooth, but don't forget  
I'll know what you'll say  
Just what I thought, I know the routine  
I know the routine, just what I thought  
I know you tell the truth, I know you don't lie  
Shh, close your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't tell if you won't tell  
It's cool with me, I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know you don't love me  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
(I know why you're here)  
I ain't sayin'

Utah Carroll
Arlo Guthrie
----------------
Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
In a grave without a headstone  
Without a date or name  
My partner lies there silent  
In the land from which I came  
Long ago we rode together  
We'd ridden side by side  
I loved him like a brother  
And I wept when Utah died  
While riding up one morning  
And our work was almost done  
The cattle quickly started  
On a wild and maddening run  
The boss's little daughter  
Who was riding on that side  
Rushed in to stop the stampede  
It was there my partner died  
Lenore upon her pony  
Tried to turn the cattle right  
But her blanket slipped beneath her  
And she caught and held on tight  
When we all saw that red blanket  
Each cowboy held his breath  
For should her pony fail her  
None could save the girl from death  
When the cattle saw the blanket  
Almost dragging on the ground  
They were maddened in a moment  
And they charged with deafening sound  
The girl soon saw her danger  
And she turned her pony's face  
And bending in her saddle  
Tried the blanket to replace  
Just then she lost her balance  
In the front of that wild tide  
Carroll's voice controlled the round up  
"Lie still, Lenore" he cried  
And then close up beside her  
Came Utah riding fast  
But little did the poor boy know  
The ride would be his last  
Full often from the saddle  
He had caught the trailing rope  
To pick her up at full speed  
Was now his only hope  
He swung low from his saddle  
To take her to his arm  
We thought that he'd succeeded  
That the girl was safe from harm  
But such a strain upon his saddle  
Had ne'er been put before  
And the cinches gave beneath him  
And he fell beside Lenore  
When the girl fell from her saddle  
She had dragged the blanket down  
It lay there close beside them  
Where they lay upon the ground  
Utah took the blanket  
And to Lenore he said  
"Lie still" and quickly running  
Waved the red thing o'er his head  
He turned the maddened cattle  
From Lenore, his little friend  
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him  
He turned to met his end  
And as the herd came on him  
His weapon quickly drew  
He was bound to die defended  
As all brave cowboys do  
The weapon flashed like lightning  
And it sounded loud and clear  
As the cattle rushed and killed him  
He dropped the leading steer  
When I broke through that wide circle  
To where poor Utah lay  
With a thousand wounds and bruises  
His life blood ebbed away  
I knelt down close beside him  
And I knew that all was o'er  
As I heard him faintly whisper  
"Good-bye, my sweet Lenore"  
Next morning at the churchyard  
I heard the preacher say  
"Don't think our kind friend Utah  
Was lost on that great day  
He was a much-loved cowboy  
And not afraid to die  
And we'll meet him at the round up  
On the plains beyond the sky"  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail

Mister Man
Culture Club
----------------
On the street  
They're preaching violence  
Mr man it's in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Ain't it obvious  
I'm just a man like you  
  
Mr man full of love  
Mr man full of hate  
Got his heart on the trigger  
But he pulled it too late  
  
Mr man is a pilot  
Mr man is a fake  
Mr man's feeling hungry  
And he's lying in wait  
  
On the street  
The lights are fighting  
Searching for someone like you  
Better find a good messiah  
To help the sad and lonely through  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Ain't it obvious  
I'm much more black than blue  
  
On the street (they're preaching violence)  
Mr man it's in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead

Kylie Minogue
----------------
Good times bad times baby you're in trouble  
You stole my heart and you're given me up  
And we're not even friends so how can we be lovers  
I wanna know the truth  
'cause I've had enough  
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But your wasting your time  
'cause if you think you've got me right just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now you've lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you  
  
Had your chance but baby you blew it  
You never loved me and baby you knew it  
And every time that you messed with my mind  
I still believed in you  
  
'cause I've had enough  
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But you're way out of line  
'cause if you think you've got me  
Boy just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now you've lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you

Give me a word and give me a sign  
Show me where to go and tell what will I find

Lay me on the ground and fly me through the air  
Show me where to go and tell me will love be there?  
Will love be there?

Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down

Maybe You Heard
Kris Kristofferson
----------------
Maybe you've heard, your ole buddy's gone crazy  
Searching for words, too deep, sweet reason and rhyme  
Living alone, more and more and he's prone to be lazy  
Turning to stone, blasted and blind.  
Chorus:  
Don't turn away there, hey, goddamn you, he was your brother  
Turn on your father, sister, mother, brother  
He was your friend.  
Don't you condemn him, leave it to strangers  
You ought to know him, give him a hand, if you can  
But at least for jesus christ's sake, understand him.  
Maybe you've heard that they say that the lady's been changing  
Day after day, more than her mind  
Learning to play, where the part has her turning to strangers  
Going too far, line after line.  
Chorus:  
Don't turn away there - hey - goddamn you, you used to love her  
Turn on your father, sister, mother, mister  
She was your friend.  
Don't you condemn her, leave it to strangers  
You ought to know her, give her a hand, if you can  
But at least for jesus christ's sake, understand her.

Lilywhite Lilith
Genesis
----------------
The chamber was in confusion - all the voices shouting loud.  
I could only just hear, a voice quite near say, "Please help me through the
crowd:"  
I said if I helped her thru' she could help me too, but I could see that she
wholly blind.  
But from her pale face and her pale skin, a moonlight shined.  
  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna lead you right.  
  
When I'd led her through the people, the angry noise began to grow.  
She said, "Let me feel the way the breezes blow, and I'll show you where to
go."  
So I followed her into a big round cave, she said, "They're coming for you,
now don't be afraid."  
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne, carved in jade.  
  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna lead you right.  
  
She leaves me in my darkness,  
I have to face, face my fear,  
And the darkness closes in on me,  
I can hear a whirring sound growing near.  
I can see the corner of the tunnel,  
Lit up by whatever's coming here.  
Two golden globes float into the room  
And a blaze of white light fills the air.

D.W. Washburn, I heard a sweet voice say.  
D.W. Washburn, this is your lucky day.  
A hot bowl of soup is waitin'.  
A hot bowl of soup and a shave.  
D.W. Washburn, we picked you to say.  
  
Can't you hear the bugle call? Can't you hear the bells?  
Even you can be reborn, you naughty  
If you don't get out of that gutter,  
before the next big rain.  
D.W. Wahsburn, you're gonna wash right down the drain.  
  
Up, up, come on get up off your street.  
If you can only make it from your hands to your knees,  
I know you can make it to your feet. Wooah!  
D.W. Washburn, I said to myself.  
D.W. Washburn, why don't you go save sombody else?  
  
Well, I got no job to go to.  
I don't work and I don't get paid.  
I got a bottle of wine, I'm feelin' fine.  
And I believe I got it made.  
  
I'd like to thank all you good people  
for comin' to my aid.  
But I'm D.W. Washburn.  
I do believe I got it made.  
  
I do believe I got it made, don't need nobody.  
I do believe I got it made, I do believe I got it made.

We Are The World - USA For Africa
Lionel Richie
----------------
There comes a time when we need a certain call  
When the world must come together as one  
There are people dying  
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life  
The greatest gift of all  
  
We can't go on pretending day by day  
That someone, somehow will soon make a change  
We're all a part of God's great big family  
And the truth - you know love is all we need  
  
Chorus:  
We are the world, we are the children  
We are the ones who make a brighter day  
So let's start giving  
There's a choice we're making  
We're saving our own lives  
It's true we'll make a better day  
Just you and me  
  
Well, send'em you your heart  
So they know that someone cares  
And their lives will be stronger and free  
As God has shown us  
By turning stone to bread  
And so we all must lend a helping hand  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
When you're down and out  
There seems no hope at all  
But if you just believe  
There's no way we can fall  
Well, well, well, let's realize  
That one change can only come  
When we stand together as one

I Ain't Got No Business Doin'
Alabama
----------------
I'm gonna call up my boss and tell him I'm ill  
Gonna tell him I'm home, with the fever and chills  
I don't usually lie but for your sweet love I will, I need it so  
  
We won't be disturbed, the phone's off the hook  
And when it comes to lovin' woman, you wrote the book  
And I just saw that 'I want you' look and that's all it took, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Well, the boys at the plant are punching the clock  
If they could see us darlin', oh, what a shock  
They'd do the same if they had what I got  
So please don't stop, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today

Hooverphonic

Suffocate your love  
In a barrel full of doubt  
Suffocate your love  
North east and south  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Hesitate, it's normal  
You can't erase mistakes  
Hesitate, it's normal  
I can't keep awake  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Come closer  
It's you I want to embrace  
Come closer  
It's you I want to debase  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand

Althea
Grateful Dead
----------------
I told Althea I was feeling lost  
Lacking in some direction  
Althea told me upon scrutiny  
That my back might need protection  
I told Althea that treachery  
Was tearing me limb from limb  
Althea told me, now cool down boy  
Settle back easy, Jim  
  
You may be Saturday's child all grown  
Moving with a pinch of grace  
You may be a clown in the burying ground  
Or just another pretty face  
You may be the fate of Ophelia  
Sleeping and perchance to dream  
Honest to the point of recklessness  
Self-centred to the extreme  
  
Ain't nobody messin' with you but you  
Your friends are getting most concerned  
Loose with the truth, maybe its your fire  
Baby I hope you don't get burned  
When the smoke has cleared, she said  
That's what she said to me  
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head  
And a little sympathy  
  
There are things you can replace  
And others you cannot  
The time has come to weigh those things  
This space is gettin' hot  
You know this space is gettin' hot  
  
I told Althea, I'm a roving sign  
That I was born to be a bachelor  
Althea told me, OK that's fine  
So now I'm trying to catch her  
Can't talk to you without talking to me  
We're guilty of the same old things  
Thinking a lot about less and less  
And forgetting the love we bring

Black Coffee
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
I'm feeling mighty lonesome  
Haven't slept a wink  
I walk the floor and watch the door  
And in between I drink  
Black coffee  
Love's a hand me down brew  
I'll never know a Sunday  
In this weekday room  
I'm talking to the shadows  
From 1 o'clock til 4  
And lord, how slow the moments go  
When all I do is pour  
Black coffee  
Since the blues caught my eye  
I'm hanging out on Monday  
My Sunday dreams to dry  
Now a man is born to go a lovin'  
A woman's born to weep and fret  
To stay at home and tend her oven  
And drown her past regrets  
In coffee and cigarettes  
I'm moaning all the morning  
And mourning all the night  
And in between it's nicotine  
And not much heart to fight  
Black coffee  
Feelin' low as the ground  
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around... around  
I'm waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around  
My nerves have gone to pieces  
My hair is turning gray  
All I do is drink black coffee  
Since my man's gone away

A Land Fit For Zeros
Proclaimers
----------------
Hold hands with the person to your right  
Hold hands and try to look sincere-o  
Tell them, though you don't know their name  
That you still can feel their pain  
Yeah you still can feel their pain  
We'll sing "Jerusalem" now boys  
As we build a land fit for zeros  
It's all that I can do to stop  
Fake tears from welling up  
Fake tears from welling up  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
You're too old, you're too poor  
You're too posh  
You'll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
Don't smoke, don't smack  
Don't eat red meat  
This is a tolerant land fit for zeros  
And if you're lost just hear my call  
"Mediocrity is all. Mediocrity is all"  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
You're too old, you're too poor  
You're too posh  
You'll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
The past is all forgotten now  
This is a young, modern land  
Fit for zeros  
And if we fight, it's only when  
We're guaranteed to win  
And should you, just stray  
Just hear my call  
"Mediocrity is all.  
Mediocrity is all"

Night Of The Swallow
Kate Bush
----------------
The night doesn't like it  
Looks just like your face on the moon to me  
And I won't let you do  
What you want to do  
It's funny how, even now, you're laughing.  
  
I won't let you do it!  
  
If you go, I'll let the law know  
And they'll head you off when you touch the ground  
Ooh, please, don't go through with this  
I don't like the sound of it  
It's funny how, even now, you're miles away  
  
I won't let you do it  
I won't let you do it  
I won't let you go through with it!  
  
Meet them over at Dover  
I'll just pilot the motor  
Take them over the water  
  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
  
Like a swallow  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
  
In Malta, catch a swallow  
For all of the guilty to set them free  
Wings fill the window  
And they beat and bleed  
They hold the sky on the other side of borderlines  
  
Meet them over at Dover  
I'll just pilot the motor  
Take them over the water  
Like a swallow flying to Malta  
  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
  
Give me a break!  
Oh, let me try!  
Give me something to show  
For my miserable life!  
Give me something to take!  
Would you break even my wings  
Just like a swallow?  
  
Let me, let me go  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
("Let me, let me go!")  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
  
("Let me, let me go!")  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonight's the night of the flight  
Before you know  
I'll be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
("Let me, let me go!")  
There's no risk  
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
They'll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And I'm home before the morning  
But you're not a swallow!

Don't Talk To Him
Cliff Richard
----------------
If some guy tells you, I don't care  
And tells you lies while I'm not there  
Don't talk to him  
If he tells you, I'm untrue  
Then darling, here what you must do  
Don't talk to him  
And if he tells you I've been seen  
Walking 'round with Sue and Jean  
He's lying again (lying again)  
Do anything that you want to  
But darling, this I beg of you  
Don't talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
He'll break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember what'd I say  
(And) Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him  
  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim (Merely a whim)  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
He'll break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember what'd I say  
Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim (Merely a whim)  
Just close your eyes, count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him

Another Shipwreck
Status Quo
----------------
I woke this morning in a different disguise  
And I was crying, crying  
You said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
I caught the mirror as I opened your letter  
I was lying, lying  
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
It was dying, dying  
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
I hear you every day, I meet you at night  
I see you crying, crying  
You say it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another earthquake  
Another shipwreck, I understand  
It's time to admit  
Despite our endeavors  
Can't find whatever we lost  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home  
I may never see home  
I may never see home again  
I woke this morning in a different disguise  
(Another shipwreck)  
I cracked a mirror as I opened your letter  
(Another shipwreck)  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
(Another shipwreck)  
I hear you every day, I meet you at night  
(Another shipwreck)  
Shipwreck

No Sweeter Name
Kari Jobe
----------------
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
No sweeter name have I ever known  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
No sweeter name have I ever known  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
  
You are the life to my heart and my soul  
You are the light to the darkness around me  
You are the hope to the hopeless and broken  
You are the only truth and the way  
  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
No sweeter name have I ever known  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
No sweeter name have I ever known  
No sweeter name than the name of Jesus  
  
You are the life to my heart and my soul  
You are the light to the darkness around me  
You are the hope to the hopeless and broken  
You are the only truth and the way  
  
You are the life to my heart and my soul  
You are the light to the darkness around me  
You are the hope to the hopeless and broken  
You are the only truth and the way, the truth and the way  
  
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

You are the life to my heart and my soul  
You are the light to the darkness around me  
You are the hope to the hopeless and broken  
You are the only truth and the way

Letters Never Sent
Carly Simon
----------------
In a suitcase tied with string  
On the highest shelf  
In the closet down the hall  
Hidden from myself  
Fits of madness, pools of grief  
Fevers of desire  
How peculiar these remain  
Salvaged from the fire  
For some I crumpled some I burned  
Some I tore to shreds  
Lifetimes later, here they are  
Ones I saved instead  
Letters never sent to you  
Letters never sent  
  
Never reached their destination  
Mostly born of pain  
Resurfaced with the purpose of  
A trip down memory lane  
  
Broken hearted, breaking hearts  
All the way it went  
Evidence of what I saw  
My experiments  
  
Life's a riddle, life's a dream  
Life's an accident  
Now I'm gonna set them free  
Letters never sent  
  
Letters never sent to you  
Letters never sent  
Once upon a time taboo  
Letters never sent  
  
Letters never sent to you  
Letters never sent  
Incongruous, and overdue  
Letters never sent

Cheat
Clash
----------------
I get violent when I'm fucked up  
I get silent when I'm drugged up  
Want excitement, don't get none, I go wild  
  
I don't know what can be done about it  
If you play the game you get nothing out of it  
Find out for yourself try bein' a goody goody  
  
You better cheat cheat  
No reason to play fair  
Cheat cheat or don't get anywhere  
Cheat cheat if you can't win  
  
Nobody knows what they are doing  
It's beyond your control, an' Friday night's a ruin  
If you want to survive you better learn how to lie  
  
Don't use the rules  
They're not for you, they're for the fools  
And you're a fool if you don't know that  
So use the rule you stupid fool

Bad Fish
Sublime
----------------
When you grab a hold of me  
Tell me that I'll never be set free  
But I'm a parasite,  
Creep and crawl I step into the night.  
Two pints of booze  
Tell me are you a badfish too?  
Are you a badfish too?  
Ain't got no money to spend  
I hope the night will never end  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef  
  
Baby you're a big blue whale  
Grab the reef when all duck diving fails  
I swim, but wish I'd never learned  
The water's too polluted with germs  
I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead  
Grab the reef underneath my bed (it's underneath my bed)  
Ain't got no quarrels with God  
Ain't got no time to grow old  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef  
  
Ain't got no quarrels with God  
Ain't got no time to get old  
Lord knows I'm weak  
Won't somebody get me off of this reef

They're really rockin' in boston  
Pittsburg, pa.  
Deep in the heart of texas  
And down in frisco bay  
Way over in st. louis  
Down in new orleans  
The cats they wanna dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
Little sixteen  
Well, she's gotta have  
About half a million  
Half a million autographs  
Oh, but tomorrow morning  
She's got to change her trend  
To be back in the classroom  
She's gotta be back in school again

California Dreamin'
America
----------------
All the leaves are brown  
And the sky is gray  
I went for a walk  
On a winter's day  
I'd be safe and warm  
If I was in L.A.  
California dreamin'  
On such a winter's day  
I stopped into a church  
(Stopped into a church)  
I passed along the way  
(Passed along the way)  
You know, I got down on my knees  
(Got down on my knees)  
And I pretend to pray  
(I pretend to pray)  
Oh, the preacher likes the cold  
(Preacher likes the cold)  
He knows I'm gonna stay  
(Knows I'm gonna stay)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
All the leaves are brown  
(The leaves are brown)  
And the sky is gray  
(And the sky is gray)  
I went for a walk  
(I went for a walk)  
On a winter's day  
(On a winter's day)  
If I didn't tell her  
(If I didn't tell her)  
I could leave today  
(I could leave today)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day

On such a winter's day

Man On The Edge
Iron Maiden
----------------
The freeway is jammed  
And it's backed up for miles  
The car is an oven and baking is wild  
Nothing is ever the way it should be  
What we deserve we just don't get you see  
  
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge  
Each step get closer to losing his head  
Is someone in heaven are they looking down  
Cause nothing is fair just you look around  
  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
  
He's sick of waiting of lying like this  
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss  
Branded a leper because you don't fit  
In the land of the free  
You can't live by your wits  
  
Once he built missiles a nation's defence  
Now he can't even give birthday presents  
Across the city he leaves in his wake  
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

And On The 8Th Day
Kiss
----------------
The sky is fallin' and the wheels of life are grindin' out a brand new beat  
The streets are burnin' with the call of the wild, and I can feel the heat  
They'll call you names and spit in your face, but legends never die  
Just pick up your guitar, on your knees and pray and hold your head up high  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
On the eighth day God created rock and roll  
  
Out of the ashes came the dawn and the shape of things to come  
Never surrender, just carry on, straight to kingdom come  
You sold your soul and virginity, ya can't rape a heart of gold  
Yes you're born to rule, it's destiny, now it can be told  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll (rock and roll)  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll (rock and roll)  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
  
Rock of ages carry the news to the heart of a brave new world  
Feel the noise in the name of rock, let the heavens roar  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll (rock and roll)  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll (rock and roll)  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll

Lifetime Piling Up
Talking Heads
----------------
I have tried marijuana  
I get nervous every time  
There will come a knockin' at the door  
Why is everybody makin' eyes at me?  
I don't want to know  
Excuse and pardon me  
Stay for a while  
Maybe we'll never meet again  
  
I can see my lifetime piling up  
I can see the days turn into nights  
I can see the people on the street  
Open those windows up  
A hundred floors below me  
Pilin' those houses up  
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher  
I can feel them swayin' back and forth  
Building it higher, higher  
This tower's learning over  
  
I got bad coordination  
Stuck a pencil in my eye  
I can hardly wait to get back home  
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid?  
I's only havin' fun  
Scum-bags and superstars  
Tell me your names  
I'll make a bet, you're  
Both the same  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin' up  
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars  
I can see the house where I was born  
When I was growin' up - they say that  
I could never keep my trousers up  
I remember days and crazy nights  
Are there any pirates on this ship?  
And if they sober up - they'll have us  
Home by morning  
  
Cry, cry, cry  
It's just you and I  
Like an automobile  
With no one at the wheel  
Spinning out of control  
We're all over the road  
In our sexy machine  
All the passengers scream  
Scream, scream!  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin' up  
I can see it smashin' into yours  
It was not an accident at all  
Open your window up - I hear you laughin'  
  
Goin' one, two, three, four, five  
Goin' from the bottom to the top  
Maybe I'm holding on too tight  
And now I'm growin' up  
I got a funny feeling  
Pilin' those houses up  
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher  
Building that highway to the stars  
And turning the music up - Hey!  
I got a winning number

Hold On
R. Kelly
----------------
Wars, walls, tumble and falls  
Time, change, clouds and rain  
Through it all, I will stand  
Come what may, um hmm  
Throw in the towel, not today  
'cause where there's a will  
There's a way, whoa  
  
1 - I'm gonna hold  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
I'm gonna hold  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Until the finish  
I'll be strong  
  
Oceans, strong winds, hills and mountains  
Sacrifice, paying the price, yeah  
Struggle all your life  
Through it all, I will stand  
Come what may, yes I will  
Throw in the towel, no not today  
'cause where there's a will  
There's a way, whoa  
  
Repeat 1  
I see tomorrow will surely come  
And I'm gonna be the first to see the sun  
Throw in the towel, not today  
'cause I know that where there's a will  
There's a way, whoa  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 1 while:  
On the highway, and the bi-way  
If I just hold on  
I'mma make it there someday  
Through the storm and through the rain  
You can knock me down  
But I'm gonna stand again  
Yes I will  
Running on this track, hey  
If I keep my pace, hey  
I can see the finish line  
I'm gonna win this race  
Hey, hold on, hold on

Remember When It Rained
Josh Groban
----------------
Wash away the thoughts inside  
That keep my mind away from you  
No more love and no more pride  
And thoughts are all I have to do  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and look up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the darkness I remain  
  
Tears of hope run down my skin  
Tears for you that will not dry  
They magnify the one within  
And let the outside slowly die  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and looked up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the water I remain  
  
Running down

My Head's In Mississippi
ZZ Top
----------------
I'm shufflin' through the Texas sand,  
but my head's in Mississippi.  
I'm shufflin' through the Texas sand,  
but my head's in Mississippi.  
The blues has got a hold of me.  
I believe I'm gettin' dizzy.  
  
Help me now  
  
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis,  
Lord, I thought I was in Heaven.  
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis,  
I thought I was in Heaven.  
But I was stumblin' through the parking lot  
of an invisible seven eleven.  
  
What was I doin out there?  
  
Where's my head baby?  
Somewhere in Mississippi.  
  
Last night I saw a cowgirl.  
She was floatin' across the ceiling.  
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl.  
She was floatin' across the ceiling.  
She was mumblin to some howlin' wolf  
about some voodoo healin'.  
  
Mmm Baby

Window
Out Of Eden

God has given me a window  
And I can finally see the light  
And though, I felt like going under  
I know it's gonna be alright, yeah, yeah  
God has given me a window

Woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
Whenever I feel like just giving up  
Whenever my dreams just fade away

40 Days And 40 Nights
Tim McGraw
----------------
Well its been rainin' on and on  
Ever since you've been gone  
Those dark clouds keep rollin' in  
And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight  
The bottom falls out again  
Well I can barely keep afloat  
I'm up the creek without a boat  
And I've been adriftin' heaven knows how long  
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone  
  
Hey, well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain  
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane  
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm  
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms  
Safe and warm  
Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine  
Baby won't you come back home  
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone  
  
Aw listen to me now  
I keep starin' out the window  
Searchin' for a rainbow  
To signal that the storm will end  
Hey, 'cause I know that the rain'll keep pourin' on the pane  
Until my saint comes back marchin' in  
Oh, girl its been a long time since I've seen sunshine  
Baby won't you come back home  
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone  
Hey, well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain  
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane  
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm  
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms  
Safe and warm  
Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine  
Baby won't you come back home  
'Cause its been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone  
Yeah its been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone

Cum erubuerint  
Infelices in progenie sua,  
Procedentes  
In peregrinatione casus,  
Tunc tu clamas clara voce,  
Hoc modo homines elevans  
De isto malitioso casu.  
O Virgo splendens hic in monte celso  
Miraculis serrato fulgentibus ubique.  
Quem fidelis conscendunt universi.  
Eya, pietatis occulo placato,  
Cene ligatos fune peccatorum  
Ne infernorum ictibus graventur,  
Said cum beatis tua prece vecentur

I've been here before  
But always hit the floor  
I've spent a lifetime running  
And I always get away  
But with you I'm feeling something  
That makes me want to stay  
  
I'm prepared for this  
I never shoot to miss  
But I feel like a storm is coming  
If I'm gonna make it through the day  
Then there's no use in running  
This is something I gotta face  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall?  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall  
  
A million shards of glass  
That haunt me from my past  
As the stars begin to gather  
And the light begins to fade  
When all hope begins to shatter  
Know that I won't be afraid  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall?  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall  
  
The writing's on the wall  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall

Stillness Of Heart
Lenny Kravitz
----------------
I'm out here on the street  
There's no one left to meet  
The things that were so sweet  
No longer move my feet  
But I keep trying  
I keep on trying  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart  
  
I got more than I can eat  
A life that can't be beat  
Yet still I feel this heat  
I'm feeling incomplete  
What am I buying?  
My soul is crying  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart  
  
Where's the love?  
What is this world we live in?  
Where's the love ?  
We've got to keep on giving  
Where's the love ?  
What happened to forgiving ?  
Anyone ?  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart

Dancing The Night Away
Cheap Trick
----------------
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
So you want to believe  
  
Everything that you read  
And you think that you're makin' the grade  
(and) just when you're getting it made  
You're still in love with her  
She'd love you to kiss her  
Hopin' you'll miss her  
  
By takin' your mind off the load  
Just when you're ready to go  
You turn your back on her  
You just got your mind on the things ahead  
At last you're gonna be free  
You'll only miss her  
Just after you kiss her  
  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
  
So you turn on the smiles  
'cause you think of the time  
And nobody knows who you are  
You don't think you'll get very far  
I don't even know your name  
At last they accept you  
In case you go next year  
  
And ask you to reach for the sky  
And just when you're ready to die  
They turn their back on you  
So they put you on ice  
In survival hotel  
  
And wish you would die from the cold  
When all you want is a night alone  
  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
Dancing the night away  
  
Dancing, and the song you sing  
Dancing, every move you make  
Dancing, makes my body go  
Dancing, right across the floor  
Dancing  
Dancing  
Dancing

Damnation's Cellar
Elvis Costello
----------------
Did anybody notice, over marmalade and eggs  
In between the princess' legs  
What with wars and floods and beggars  
Not to mention stocks and shares  
If you have a moment to spare  
Can you write and reassure me that I have seen  
They're constructing a time machine  
There will be no need for the obituary pages  
We can have any hero from the bygone ages  
'Til the truth emerges, the argument rages  
  
[Chorus:]  
The major and the minor  
Turn from tallow into tar  
Should we leave them in their place?  
Down in damnation's cellar  
  
When any form of deity that you might enjoy  
Can be conjured with a test-tube and a flame  
If it's out there then science can explain it  
Or at least remove the blame  
And if there's is anyone you'd like to see again  
The speak up quickly  
  
Send us back Da Vinci then we don't have to ponder  
The maddening smile of "La Giaconda"  
The critics say Nijinsky, the dancer, of course  
While the punters would probably prefer the horse  
You'll find it's quicker than history, cheaper than divorce  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan  
Shakespeare will have to wait his turn  
Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return  
I suppose we live and learn, though it's hard to believe as we  
Cheerfully burn  
It's curious  
Some will call for justice.  
There are murders to solve  
What about Hitler? or at least lee Harvey Oswald  
Give us this day and everything we squander  
Anyone beautiful  
Somebody blonder  
They'll never please mankind, so lie back and enjoy it  
Stop press: they've just decided to destroy it  
  
[Chorus:]

Steal Your Heart
Gloria Estefan
----------------
I don't mean to be the teardrop spilling over your resentments  
Don't intend to be the cry with which you voice your discontent  
I don't wanna be a picture, fading slowly from your memory  
Don't intend to be a shadow simply darkening your passage  
Only wanna lose myself behind the mirror of your eyes  
Be the only balm that soothes the secret passions in your life  
Only want to lose my senses, lose your sorrow calm this madness  
Be the only one you count on to alleviate your sadness  
I'll steal your heart and set it free  
Tear down the walls that would surround you  
I may hold you close to me  
But these ties will never bind you  
I don't mean to be the fire that's igniting your temptations  
Don't intend to be the sword that runs you through with adoration  
I don't want to be a whisper, my emotions wrapped in silence  
Don't intend to be the shout, reminding you that time is priceless  
Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground  
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that we've found  
Only want to breathe your essence, be your comfort, fill with laughter  
Every moment that we live from this day on, forever after  
I'll steal your heart and set it free  
So free, I'm sure it will astound you  
Without my love you'll never be  
In some way, I'll always find you  
I'll steal your heart and set it free  
Tear down the walls that would surround you  
I may hold you close to me  
But these ties will never bind you  
Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground  
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that we've found  
Only want to breathe your essence, be your comfort, fill with laughter  
Every moment that we live from this day on, forever after  
I'll steal your heart and set it free  
So free, I'm sure it will astound you  
Without my love you'll never be  
In some way, I'll always find you  
I'll steal your heart and set it free  
Tear down the walls that would surround you  
I may hold you close to me  
But these ties will never bind you  
I'll steal your heart and set it free

Tuck Away My Lonesome Blues
Wanda Jackson
----------------
(Yodel)  
I'm always blue, feeling so blue  
I wish, I had someone I knew  
Just to help me tuck away my blues  
Lonesome blues  
So won't you be that someone  
To help me lose the blues  
I really need someone to love me, someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me, someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues  
(Yodel)  
I really need someone to love me, someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me, someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues  
(Yodel)

Hold On To Me
John Denver
----------------
We were live on arrival  
Safe home at last  
No cannon fire dockside  
No flags half-mast  
  
We were sold out for silver  
And a string of black pearls  
On the loneliest island  
At the edge of the world  
  
Like destiny's children  
Souls lost at sea  
No room on the lifeboat  
You can hold on to me  
  
Now the voyage is over  
We're back on dry land  
In our eyes are the stories  
The rope and the brand  
  
Like destiny's children  
Souls lost at sea  
No room on the lifeboat  
You can hold on to me

Love Me Tonight
Tom Jones
----------------
I know that it's late and I really must leave you alone  
But you're good to hold and I feel such a long way from home  
Yes I know that our love is still new  
And I promise it's gonna be true  
Please let me stay don't you send me away oh no no  
Ah tell me baby that you need me  
Say you'll never leave me love me tonight  
Hold me now my heart is aching  
And until the dawn is breaking love me tonight  
Something is burning inside  
Something that can be denied  
I can't let you out of my sight darling love me tonight  
I've waited so long for the girl of my dreams to appear  
And now I can't hardly believe that you really are here  
Here in my arms you belong  
How can this feeling be wrong  
Darling be kind for I'm out of my mind over you  
Ah tell me baby that you need me  
Say you'll never leave me love me tonight  
Baby now the pain is stronger  
I can't wait a moment longer love me tonight  
Something is burning inside  
Something that can be denied  
I can't let you out of my sight darling love me tonight  
Let me love you baby  
Let me love you baby  
Let me love you tonight  
Love me tonight

Somebody Somewhere
Loretta Lynn
----------------
Somebody, somewhere  
Don't know what he's missin' tonight.  
It must have all started with that darn'd old Late Show.  
It made me so lonely and sad.  
And to make it all better, I kept getting bluer,  
With each little drink that I had.  
So I tuned in a dj,  
Who played every sad song he owned.  
Lord, I need someone so, but everyone I know,  
Is away, bein' needed at home.  
Somebody, somewhere  
Don't know what he's missin' tonight.  
Lord, here sits a woman,  
Just lonesome enough to be right.  
For love 'em or leave 'em,  
How I need someone to hold tight.  
Somebody, somewhere  
Don't know what he's missin' tonight...

Eternity
Richard Marx
----------------
I was born on the banks of eternity  
A page of the history it teaches  
Not a care, lived my life like a hurricane  
Leaving everything along the way in pieces  
  
Some may have cheered, some may have wondered  
If I am flesh, if I am stone  
Thoughts of you tear through me like thunder  
You are the light that has led me back home  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
I've got no reputation living in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
Let me bury this disguise  
  
A southern boy has it harder sometimes  
It's like you were climbing a razor  
You were there when my dreams had all turned to dust  
And the man in the mirror was a stranger  
  
Look at me now, a soulless survivor  
No mask can hide the man that I've made  
You ease my pain  
Your make it silent  
Slowly I feel it beginning to fade  
  
I want to feel it  
Rushing over me into the tide  
I want to taste it  
Every moment 'til the end of my life  
  
I have laid still, adrift in you memory  
Hoping your faith would erase all the years  
Maybe some time, maybe some magic  
Maybe your love will make everything clear  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
I've got no reputation living in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
Let me bury this disguise  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
There are no expectations hiding in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
And let me bury this disguise

True Colors
Phil Collins
----------------
You with the sad eyes  
Don't be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
It's hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all and the darkness,  
Inside you makes you feel so small  
  
But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Show me a smile then,  
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when  
I last saw you laughing  
If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Just show your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Such sad eyes  
Discouraged now  
Realize  
  
When this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Just show your true colors  
True colors, true colors  
  
'Cause there's a shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors, true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Beautiful, like a rainbow  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Show me your colours  
Show me your rainbow  
  
(That's why I love you) Show me your colours  
Show me your rainbow

Give You What You Like
Avril Lavigne
----------------
Please wrap your drunken arms around me  
And I'll let you call me yours tonight  
Cause slightly broken's just what I need  
And if you give me what I want  
Then I'll give you what you like  
  
Please tell me I'm your one and only  
Or lie and say at least tonight  
I've got a brand new cure for lonely  
And if you give me what I want  
Then I'll give you what you like  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love?  
Maybe some day  
So don't turn on the lights  
I'll give you what you like  
  
Emotions aren't that hard to borrow  
When love is a word you've never learned  
And in a room of empty bottles  
If you don't give me what I want  
Then you'll get what you deserve  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love?  
Maybe some day  
  
I've got this scene in my head  
I'm not sure how it ends  
Is it love?  
Maybe one day  
  
So don't turn on the lights  
I'll give you what you like  
  
I'll give you one last chance to hold me  
If you give me one last cigarette  
By now it's early in the morning  
Now that I gave you what you want  
All I want is to forget  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love?  
Maybe some day  
  
I've got this scene in my head  
I'm not sure how it ends  
Is it love?  
Maybe one day  
So don't turn on the lights  
I'll give you what you like

Oh Louisiana
Chuck Berry
----------------
Oh, Louisiana, I stayed away from you too long  
Oh, Louisiana, how can a true love go so wrong ?  
She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, Louisiana, yea, yea, Creole baby, Cajun queens  
Quaint porches and windows, filet de gumbo, the Basin beans  
Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, Louisiana, yea-e-e, yea, I'm flyin' on Delta Nine-o-three  
Right over St. Louis, high over Memphis, Tennessee  
On southward to the sea, where I long to be  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, o, Louisiana, yea, yea, them Yankee nights are cold and long  
Oh, Louisiana, she broke my heart and wrecked my home  
She shamed me in sorrow, to face my tomorrow  
Oh, take me back, oh, Louisiana

Let's Stay Engaged
Tragically Hip
----------------
It might be late  
But it won't be early  
You got me to the gate  
With time for a coffee  
It's getting late  
Sounds like a departure  
It's getting close  
Sounds to me like a departure  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged  
  
Lies over time  
Float to the surface  
Lies over time  
They equal surface  
Lies over time  
Though the reasons desert us  
Lies over time  
With no apparent purpose  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged  
  
See the dead art  
And you see your reflection  
Fear no art  
And you fear no reflection  
But don't look at me  
I'm not the artist in question  
Sounds good to me  
But I'm not the artist in question  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged

Secret Touch
Rush
----------------
The way out  
Is the way in  
The way out  
Is the way in...  
  
Out of touch  
With the weather and the wind direction  
With the sunrise  
And the phases of the moon  
Out of touch  
With life in the land of the loving  
With the living night  
And the darkness at high noon  
  
You can never break the chain  
There is never love without pain  
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart  
  
Out of sync  
With the rhythm of my own reactions  
With the things that last  
And the things that come apart  
Out of sync  
With love in the land of the living  
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart  
  
A healing hand, a secret touch on the heart  
  
There is never love without pain  
Life is a power that remains

Baby, Won't You Please Come Home
Ella Fitzgerald
----------------
Oh baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama's all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to call your name  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Oh baby, my baby  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama needs some lovin'  
Baby, won't you please come on home?

There But For The Grace Of God
Alan Parsons Project
----------------
An anthem to the human condition  
  
Lead vocal: john miles  
  
What kind of madness rule the world today  
What earthly reason holding sway  
There is no heaven at all  
For some may weep  
And some may sleep  
While some may rise  
And some may fall  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go I  
  
And so we live in lives of fantasy  
And dream of dreams that hold the key  
And we follow like sheep  
We thread the path  
That leads to thee  
We seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go i

R. Kelly

Anything you want baby  
Anything your heart desires  
Because you've been there for me  
(Truly there for me)  
I'm gonna give it to you  
Listen  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby [Repeat: x4]  
  
Anything you want, I'm gonna give it to you girl

Gonna show you all the love I have in store for you  
I gotta let you know that I am truly down with you, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like no other homie, you are always there for me  
The only girl I know that truly satisfies my needs  
When I was down and out you were hangin' by my side  
And now that I am holdin' you, you'll always be in my life, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Taking me to church on Sunday morning, girl is cool  
Because I found a blessing and some happiness in you  
Whenever there is darkness, G you brighten up my day  
I thank the Lord for you because you understand my ways, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I look at you I see the breaking of the day  
I'm mighty glad to know that Heaven sent your love my way  
It's something about the way you do your lovin' when you do  
And now until forever, baby, I'll be lovin' you, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You were always there for me, you know what I'm saying?  
So today I'm taking you out, buy you something real nice  
I'm gonna be here for you until the day becomes the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the bottom of my heart, yes promise me we'll never part  
Let's say a prayer together, say a prayer together baby  
Can we say a prayer together baby  
Heavenly Father which art in heaven  
I pray that you keep this love together  
This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby, I love you

Stories
Hanson
----------------
When we were young, stories were told  
That I would kiss you sweet like  
People said there was a connection between us  
Now that we're older stories are told  
Of how I hold you tight  
Whenever I see those people  
I tell them they were right  
Stories will be told  
From when our children are young  
Until they're old  
About our endless love  
We must have had a blessing from above  
Stories will be told until we're old  
Stories will be told until the end of time  
Stories will be told until we're old  
Stories will be told until the end of time  
Until the sun won't rise  
Oh, let me tell you mine, let me tell you mine  
It all started on 77th Street  
When we were just thirteen  
I had no cares at all  
Until I saw you in the corner of my eye  
It changed my views  
It changed my whole life

Strawberry Fields Forever
Cyndi Lauper
----------------
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
Living is easy with eyes closed,  
Misunderstanding all you see.  
It's getting hard to be someone  
But it all works out,  
It doesn't matter much to me.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
No one I think is in my tree,  
I mean it must be high or low.  
That is you can't you know tune in  
But it's all right, that is  
I think it's not too bad.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
Always, no sometimes, think it's me,  
But you know I know when it's a dream.  
I think I know I mean a 'Yes'  
But it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
Strawberry Fields forever.

Metal
Nine Inch Nails
----------------
We're in the building where they make us grow  
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers  
Like you  
  
My Mallory heart is sure to fail  
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real  
Like you  
  
The sound of metal I want to be you  
I should learn to be a man  
Like you  
  
Plug me in and turn me on  
Oh everything is moving  
  
I need my treatment it's tomorrow they send me  
Singing "I am an American"  
Do you?  
  
Picture this if I should make the change  
I'd like to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you?  
  
And who are you and how can I try  
Here inside I like the metal  
Don't you?  
  
All I know is no one dies  
I'm still confusing love with need

Stuck In The Moment
Justin Bieber
----------------
With you,  
With you,  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place  
  
Now Romeo and Juliet,  
Bet they never felt the way we felt,  
Bonnie and Clyde,  
Never had to hide like,  
We do,  
We do  
  
You and I both know it can't work,  
It's all fun and games,  
'Til someone gets hurt,  
And I don't,  
I won't let that be you  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
There might be something real between us two, who knew?  
Now we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
'Cause I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like Adam and Eve,  
Tragedy was our destiny,  
Like Sunny and Cher,  
I don't care,  
I got you baby  
  
See we both,  
Fightin' every inch of our fiber,  
'Cause ain't no way,  
It's gonna end right but,  
We are both too foolish to stop  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?  
And we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
And I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like,  
Just because this cold cold world saying we can't be,  
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,  
And I ain't with it,  
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,  
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,  
But convention's telling us to let go,  
So we'll never know  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
'Cause everything we did,  
And everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
Yeah  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do,  
(Nothing my heart can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause, (and space)  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you,  
Yeah,

Lend A Helpin' Hand
Lynyrd Skynyrd
----------------
Oh. Now when you think the time's flying  
Take a look around  
'Cause babies are dying from disease  
Sleeping out on the ground  
  
People never seen the tortured eyes  
From a foreign land. No  
When you see somebody who's down and out  
Lend a helpin' hand  
  
You better, lend a helpin' hand. If you can  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Do it if you can  
  
Oh. Every time you feed your face  
Do you bow your head  
Hunger kills each and every day  
Won't you share your bread  
  
If you've ever felt the pain inside  
I know you'd understand  
When you see somebody who's down and out  
Lend a helpin' hand  
  
You better, lend a helpin' hand. If you can  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Do it if you can  
  
Oh. Every time you feed that face  
Do you look around  
For somebody right in your own neighborhood  
Sleepin' out on the ground  
  
And do some down south jukin'  
If you've ever felt the pain inside  
I know you'd understand  
When you see somebody who's down and out  
  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Why don't you, lend a helpin' hand. If you can  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Won't you please lend a helpin' hand

Blackjack County Chains
Christy Moore
----------------
I was sittin' beside the road in Black Jack County.  
Not knowing that the Sheriff paid a bounty,  
For men like me that hadn't got a penny to their name.  
So he locked my leg to 35 pounds of Black Jack County  
Chains.  
  
And all we had to eat was bread and water,  
Each day we built the road a mile and a quarter,  
A Black Snake Whip would cut the back of any man who complained,  
But we couldn't fight back wearing 35 pounds of Black  
Jack County Chains.  
  
One night while the Sheriff he was sleeping,  
We all gathered round him slowly creeping,  
Heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain,  
When we beat him to death with 35 pounds of Black Jack  
County Chains.  
  
Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful,  
There's nothing left but a scar around my ankle.  
But most of all I'm glad no man will be a slave again,  
To a Black Snake Whip and 35 pounds of Black Jack County  
Chains.

Dindi
Natalie Cole
----------------
Sky so vast is the sky  
With far away clouds just wandering by  
Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know  
  
Wind that speaks to the leaves  
Telling Stories that no one believes  
Stories of love belong to you and me  
  
Oh Dindi, if I only had words  
I would say all the beautiful things that I see  
When you're with me, oh, my Dindi  
  
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees  
That's how my heart is singing Dindi  
Happy Dindi when you're with me  
  
I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do  
I'd let you go away if you take me with you  
  
Don't you know, my Dindi?  
I'd be running and searching for you  
Like a river that can't find the sea  
That would be me without you, my Dindi  
  
I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do  
I'd let you go away if you take me with you  
  
Don't you know, Dindi?  
I'd be running and searching for you  
Like a river that can't find the sea  
That would be me without you, without you, yeah  
My Dindi, my Dindi, my Dindi

Stairway To The Stars
Natalie Cole
----------------
Intro  
There's a silver trail of moonlight leading upward to the sky  
And the night is like a velvet lullaby  
There's a heaven of blue  
And we'll go there, just you and I  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
And climb that stairway to the stars  
With love beside us to fill the night with a song  
  
We'll hear the sound of violins  
Out yonder where the blue begins  
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along  
  
Chorus:  
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal  
Over the rim of the hill?  
Can't we sail away on a little dream  
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

Swinging Doors
Wanda Jackson
----------------
This ol' smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to  
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied  
I just called to let you know where I'll be livin'  
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside  
I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a bar stool  
And my new home has a flashing neon sign  
Stop by and see me anytime you want to  
Cause I'm always here at home till closin' time  
  
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy  
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind  
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches  
Thanks to you I'm always here till closin' time  
And I've got swinging doors  
Cause I'm always here at home till closin' time

Three Button Hand Me Down
Faces
----------------
I don't need no one's opinion  
On the matter concerning my dress  
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma  
There were many things I did not possess  
I never complained because my father said  
"son, you'll get your chance before you're my age."  
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit  
Written all over his face  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'."  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down  
  
I had my fair share of neat women  
But they came between me and my suit  
That was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston  
Not forgetting the one in Detroit  
They said, "we like you, boy, and we think you're sweet  
But can't you lose your suit?"  
I said, "no, you can't do that to me."  
I remember what my father said  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'."  
Three button hand me down, ha, ha  
Three button hand me down  
  
I've never been a tidy dresser  
And the fold in my trousers - it ain't straight  
Still, I know a good cloth when I see one  
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit  
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor  
And get myself a smooth outfit  
Then I remember what my father said to me  
I'll make you from the open road  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you go."  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down

Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me
Alice Cooper
----------------
Don't sing me lullabies  
I won't close my eyes,  
I can't close my eyes  
It's true,  
I'm doomed  
'til dawn  
Shines through  
Got too many things to do  
Got friends to see,  
I can't miss a thing  
It's true,  
I'm through  
I'm screwed,  
Unglued  
  
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,  
I never close my eyes  
You see, they're always there with funny hair,  
Oh, I'm so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isn't real  
I'll show you wounds that never heal  
To them I'm just a happy meal  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
  
Make the coffee black as night  
Help me through the night  
I know their appetite for me  
I'm meat  
But I'm sweet  
As can be  
And if I do too much booze  
I begin to snooze  
I hear the big old floppy shoes  
It's true,  
I'm stew,  
Unchewed  
  
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,  
I never close my eyes  
See, they're always there with that funny hair,  
Oh, I'm so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isn't real  
I'll show you wounds that never heal  
To them I'm just a happy meal  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me

Friday
Phish
----------------
I crashed a  
Learned to keep my eye on you  
You always say you'll lead the way, but then you never do  
I slow a swerve but lost my nerve and quickly looked away  
When I looked back, the day was black  
Then I heard you say  
Why is the sun high, and why does it rain  
Why is there danger and why is there pain  
Why can't the burden be carried away  
And why isn't it Friday today  
  
Your lack of trust is hardly just  
So do as you've been told  
Please follow me into the sea  
Don't worry if its cold  
I knew right then my chance again  
Had quickly slipped away  
I crashed, I cried, I burned my eyes  
Ill follow anyway  
  
Why is the sea cold, why is it blue  
Why do I stay here, why is it you  
Notice the danger, don't help it anyway  
Why isn't it Friday today  
  
I knew right then my chance again  
Would quickly slip away  
I crash, I cry, I burn my eyes  
I still follow anyway

Scorpions

Who's gonna tell you when, it's too late  
Who's gonna tell you things, aren't so great  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna pick you up, when you fall  
Who's gonna hang it up, when you call  
Who's gonna pay attention, to your dreams  
Who's gonna plug your ears, when you scream  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna hold you down, when you escape  
Who's gonna come around, when you break  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

Why Don't We Live Together?
Pet Shop Boys
----------------
There comes a time in everyone's life  
When all of the parties every night  
They're not enough  
You want something more (Tell me)  
I want you  
I want you  
  
(Tell)  
(Tell)  
  
I find you when I want you  
And lose you late at night  
The woman in me shouts out  
The man in me just smiles  
I may not always love you  
You may not care  
But if we should live together  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby))  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide  
  
We'll find a home together  
(Baby) And sleep there every night  
(Baby) There's a time and place for most things  
(Baby) This time we'll get it right  
(Aah) You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me, baby  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Baby)  
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide  
  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together? (together baby)  
Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together?  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
(Baby)  
(Ooh, baby, baby, why don't we live?)  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

I may not care  
But intuition tells me, baby  
There's something we could share  
If we dare  
Why don't we?  
  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Ooh ooh))

Why don't we live together? (together)  
Together? (together baby)  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
(Baby, Ooh, baby)  
(Saying why don't we live together)  
  
You won't believe until the day you try ((Baby, baby))  
(Baby) Why don't we live together?  
Why don't we live together?  
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Ooh ooh)  
You won't believe in love until the day you try  
(Baby)  
Without the love, love you feel inside

Set It Up
Xavier Rudd
----------------
Turn around to the jungle  
Turn around outside  
It's out there in the jungle  
There is truth among lies  
And I've been to cold dark places  
And I've had a broken shoulder  
The code of the cold dark places  
Have some bright one feel so warm  
And if you want her up be sure to help you down  
And if you burn it up you take the ashes to the ground  
And if you grow it keep the truth deep, deep down  
And if you set it up be sure to set it down  
See you laugh with those voices  
See you laugh with their heads  
And thoughts that I felt to be pulling  
It send new shades of gray  
And I've been to cold dark places  
And I've had leave old mind  
The code of the cold dark places  
Seem to help the sun to shine  
And if you want her up be sure to help you down  
And if you burn it up you take the ashes to the ground  
And if you grow it up keep the truth deep, deep down  
And if you set it up be sure to set it down  
Searching, searching for close  
Closest to the people that I love the most  
Start to feel you and everything you do  
As everything you do comes back to you  
Spirits, of evil and grace intrusion of the mind  
And intrusion of the space  
And I'm sorry 'cause everything I do  
And everything you do comes back to you  
I feel you and everything I do  
As everything you do comes back to you  
I feel you and everything I do  
'Cause everything I do comes back to you

Set yourself free

You Make Me Crazy
Utopia
----------------
I waited all night  
I smoked a hundred cigarettes  
I chewed my lip 'til it bled  
But the phone made not a sound  
Sometimes I wonder  
If you ever wonder what's become of little old me  
But I ain't no baby  
I ain't gonna cry but baby  
You don't know what's going on inside me  
Why know you make me crazy  
What you do to me  
It's a chemical reaction or an allergy  
Why know you make me crazy  
You're aware of that  
Why don't you come and put me away  
It was a long night  
I could barely keep my head  
I heard a knock on the door  
It was only Harry Jones  
I used to wonder  
What it is that makes me feel like I can't be free  
'Cause you don't give me nothing  
You never give me nothing  
But you don't know what's going on inside me  
Why know you make me crazy  
I'm in misery  
Are you interested enough to see what's left of me  
You scared me  
The way you move in the night  
Your face is something frightening  
You're not so nice  
I'm gonna wonder  
Who you spend your time with  
Everywhere you go and what you see  
I know I'm not your daddy  
I don't want to be your daddy  
But you know what's going on inside me

Not Supposed To Sing The Blues
Europe
----------------
Born in 1963  
In the shadow of Kennedy  
I'm still a kid when the levee breaks  
Man, oh man, that's all it takes  
  
And I'm on my way  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
But all I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done  
  
Back in black and I'm 17  
I've been told, son, let it be  
I got these lines upon my face now  
A room at the heartbreak hotel  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh well, oh well  
Ah yeah  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
All I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done  
  
Oh well, oh well  
Alright  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
But all I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done

Put Yourself In My Place
Kylie Minogue
----------------
I can't take this situation  
It's making me feel so blue  
One moment you walked into my life  
And now you're saying that we're through  
I hear that you're in love now  
Oh babe I don't know what to say  
I can't believe that I still feel this way  
I hear that you're in love now  
Oh babe I don't know what to say  
But before you decide that you won't be mine  
You'd better put yourself in my place  
  
You know the circle will come around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place  
When your lovers bring you down  
And there's no one else around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place  
  
There's no rhyme or reason  
That keeps me playing along  
I guess that I keep believing  
Inside you, love will know right from wrong  
I hear that you're in love now  
Oh babe I don't know what to say  
But before you decide that you won't be mine  
You'd better put yourself in my place  
  
You know the circle will come around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place  
When your lovers bring you down  
And there's no one else around  
You're gonna put yourself in my place

Daddy's Song
Kris Kristofferson
----------------
I got a day without nothing to do  
And a "do not disturb" on my door  
I sorta looked for some mess that she'd made  
Or her sweet little socks on the floor  
But all that she left here was too many rooms  
And just enough silence to break  
And I can't look at her picture right now  
Time's about all I can take.  
Last night I sewed up her toys that were torn  
And packed her suitcase again  
She looked so sweet as she lay there asleep  
Smiling and holding my hand  
We didn't talk all the way to the plane  
But she's too big now to cry  
Then when I kissed her, she held me so tight  
I couldn't tell her goodbye.  
Chorus:  
She said, "I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart"  
It's not so bad out here living alone  
Comfort's a stranger away  
And there's a freedom you find on your own  
That's nearly worth what you pay  
It's just a shame she still wants us to be  
All that we seemed to before  
But we can't blame her for making believe  
Something we don't anymore.  
Chorus:  
She said, "I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart"

Canadian Idiot
Weird Al Yankovic
----------------
Don't want to be a Canadian idiot  
  
Don't want to be some beer swillin' hockey nut  
And do I look like some frost bitten hosehead  
I never learned my alphabet from A to zed  
  
They all live on donuts and moose meat  
And they leave the house without packin' heat  
Never even bring their guns to the mall  
And you know what else is too funny  
Their stupid monopoly money  
Can't take 'em seriously at all  
  
Well maple syrup and snow's what they export  
They treat curling just like it's a real sport  
They think their silly accent is so cute  
Can't understand a thing they're talking aboot  
  
Sure they got their national health care  
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air  
Then again well they got Celine Dion  
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni  
And dream of driving a Zamboni  
All over Saskatchewan  
  
Don't want to be a Canadian idiot  
We'll figure out their temperature in Celsius  
See the map they're hovering right over us  
Tell you the truth it makes me kinda nervous  
  
Always hear the same kind of story  
Break your nose and they'll just say sorry  
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite  
It's gotta mean they're all up to something  
So quick before they see it coming  
Time for a pre-emptive strike

Song To My Assassin
Leonard Cohen
----------------
(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Michael) We were chosen, we were chosen  
Miles and miles apart  
I to love your kingdom  
You to love my heart  
  
(Angels) We were chosen  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
(Michael) The love is intermittent  
The discipline continues  
I work on your spirit  
You work on my sinews.  
  
(Angels) We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
We have fun 'cause  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
(Michael) I watch myself from where you are  
Please do not be mistaken  
The spider web you see me through  
Is the view I've always taken  
  
  
Begin the ceremony now  
That we have been preparing  
I'm tired of this marble floor  
That we have both been sharing.  
  
(Angels) Now we will be sharing  
What he has been preparing!  
  
(Girls) He's the only one  
He's the only one  
He's the riddle of the music  
He's the music of my life  
  
(Boys) Now it begins  
Now it begins  
He's the riddle of the music  
He's the music of the sacrifice  
  
(Valkyries) Messenger  
Messenger  
Our will  
Will be done  
  
(Angels) We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
(Everyone) Begin the ceremony  
Begin the sacrifice ...

Tracy Jacks
Blur
----------------
(Tracy Jacks) works in civil service  
(Tracy Jacks) it's steady employment  
(Tracy Jacks) it's a golfing fanatic  
(Tracy Jacks) but his put is erratic  
(Tracy Jacks) saw a harley street doctor  
(Tracy Jacks) who prescribed healthy living  
(Tracy Jacks) but he's getting past forty  
(Tracy Jacks) and all the seams are splitting  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But it's just so overrated  
  
(Tracy Jacks) left home without warning  
(Tracy Jacks) at five in the morning  
(Tracy Jacks) got on the first train to walton  
(Tracy Jacks) and stood on the seafront  
(Tracy Jacks) threw his clothes in the water  
(Tracy Jacks) and ran around naked  
(Tracy Jacks) got stopped by the police  
(Tracy Jacks) and escorted back home  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But then it's just so overrated  
  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
  
And then it happened on a Tuesday morning  
Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in  
Saying it's just so overrated  
  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But it was always overrated

The World Is Mine
David Guetta
----------------
I believe in the wonder,  
I believe this new life took in,  
Like a God that I'm under,  
There's drugs running through my veins,  
I believe in the wonder,  
I believe I can touch the flame,  
There's a spell that I'm under,  
Got to fly, I don't feel no shame,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
  
Take a look what you've started,  
In the world flashing from your eyes,  
And you know that you've got it,  
From the thunder you feel inside,  
I believe in a feeling,  
Of the pain that you left to die,  
I believe in the livin'  
In life that you give to try,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
Mine,  
Mine,  
The world is mine,  
  
I've lost my fear to what appears,  
I do my best,  
The world is mine,  
You take the price and realize,  
That's in your eyes,  
The world is mine,  
I've lost my fear to what appears,  
I do my best,  
The world is mine,  
You take the price and realize,  
That's in your eyes,  
The world is mine,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine

Dreammare
Uriah Heep
----------------
Grinning demons, smiling sideways  
Laughing in my face  
Here within my troubled sleep  
There's such a lonely place  
Running fast but never moving  
I can't get away  
Strange but realistic objects  
Making me their prey  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Evil dream  
Changing like the sun turn to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Dining with the gods of beauty  
On a distant shore  
Tasting fruits of untold sweetness  
Never seen before  
Dancing stars with crystal voices  
Beckon with their eyes  
Unicorn of many colours  
Rides to paradise  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Sleepless nights that last a lifetime  
Crucify my head  
Dreams of peace and then disaster  
Wish that I were dead  
Looking for the end of darkness  
Seeking out the day  
For escape with speed unthought of  
Bearing me away  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Come into my dream

In My Room
Utada Hikaru
----------------
On a Tuesday morning we pass in the hallway  
But you don't notice  
I'm sure you don't even know my name  
But I don't care about that  
  
With fake nails, color contacts  
Extensions decorating my hair and wearing fake fur  
Why am I looking for true love?  
Fighting is okay, but I'm tired of that  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If I close my mouth, lies and truth are the same  
  
It's a line that moves my soul, but I can't hear anything  
From far away someone is calling me  
But I don't yet want to return  
The noise of the city is comfortable  
  
Cold, kind, I'm enfolded in my own private zone  
Why am I always searching for a place to be?  
I laugh, I cry, I don't mind if I hurt people  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
  
That's why I'm always with you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same  
There are days when I want to run away  
And forget everything  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same

Moth To A Flame
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
I can't break free  
There's some kind of hold over me  
Like a magnet, you attract me like steel  
I'm a kamikaze pilot, it's a one-way flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
I'm a do or die fanatic, no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You don't stand a snowball's chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time before I get  
Over my head in your quicksand bed  
The more I struggle the more I'm sucked in  
Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
I'm a kamikaze pilot, it's a one-way flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
I'm a do or die fanatic, no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You don't stand a snowball's chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time before I get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time  
Moth to a flame  
Missing you in action  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time

I Won't Let You Do That To Me
Luther Vandross
----------------
Wait a minute  
This is where I draw the line  
Tell me what's got into you  
Cuz apparently you've lost your mind  
Repetitious fault just can't be overlooked  
So I'm reading you your rights in case  
You misunderstood  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, honey, dream on  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
Don't think I haven't checked out  
All your alibies  
And the evidence concludes  
That you're just telling me half the truth  
Still I keep giving you  
The benefit of doubt  
Cuz I fell so deep in love with you  
I struggle to get around  
So if you wanna be down for me  
I'm gonna be down for you  
And if twice you break the rules  
I've got to move on  
You believed your first time  
Cost you 25 years to life  
But I won't wait for a third heartbreak  
With my heart it's only two  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
I don't believe you would mistake me for a fool  
So if you're really smart, you better think twice  
Before you move  
I'll be too busy watching to hear a word you say  
Just don't make the same mistake again  
And everything's ok  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me

Children Go Where I Send Thee
Johnny Cash
----------------
Children go where I send thee  
How shall I send thee?  
  
I'm gonna send thee two by two  
Two by Paul and Silas  
One by the little bitty baby  
Born, born, born in Bethlehem  
  
Children go where I send thee

I'm gonna send thee three by three  
Three by the Hebrew children  
Two by Paul and Silas

Born, born, born in Bethlehem  
  
Children go where I send thee  
Children, how shall I send thee?  
  
I'm gonna send thee four by four  
Four by four that stood at the door  
Three by the Hebrew children  
Two by Paul and Silas  
One by the little bitty baby  
Who was born, born, born in Bethlehem  
  
Children go where I send thee  
How shall I send thee?  
  
I'm gonna send thee five by five  
Five by the five it couldn't get by  
Four by the four that stood at the door  
Three by the Hebrew children  
Two by Paul and Silas  
One by the little bitty baby  
Born, born, born in Bethlehem  
  
Children go where I send thee  
How shall I send thee?  
  
I'm gonna send thee six by six  
Six by the six that couldn't get fixed  
Five by the five couldn't get by  
Four by the four that stood at the door  
Three by the Hebrew children  
Two by Paul and Silas  
One by the little bitty baby  
Who was born, born, born in Bethlehem  
  
Six by the six, couldn't get fixed  
Five by the five that couldn't get by  
Four by the four that stood at the door  
Three by the three for the Hebrew children  
Two by two for Paul and Silas  
One by the little bitty baby  
Who was born, born, born in Bethlehem  
  
Who was born, born, born in Bethlehem  
Yes, He was born, born, born in Bethlehem

One Teardrop At A Time
Wanda Jackson
----------------
(One teardrop one teardrop)  
I know that I've cried a lot today and my heart's gonna hurt the same old way  
Cause I'm losin' the love I thought was mine  
The heartache's brought one teardrop at a time  
One teardrop at a time keeps telling me that won't be long until you'll be
leaving me  
When you go I'm gonna cry one more time  
I'll take back my heart one teardrop at a time  
No matter how many tears I cried that old familiar feeling stays inside  
My heart for you won't leave just in time  
I'll cry you from my heart one teardrop at a time  
One teardrop at a time...

I Play The Road
Zac Brown Band
----------------
I play the road,  
And the highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd has come and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
Every exit is a season,  
Every signal is a beacon  
And the wind, it carries me  
And it eases up my load  
Everyday I drag the turns  
Every candle still burns  
And every lesson I have learned  
Brings us closer to the crowd  
  
I play the road,  
And the highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
Well the bus it is our steeple,  
It brings us to the people  
And they will be there waiting,  
Dancing young and old  
And every one of us gets tired,  
But every one remains inspired  
And every one of us require  
To keep picking through our souls  
  
I play the road,  
And the highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
She says, "Daddy where do you go  
When you leave me all these nights  
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand?  
Kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile,  
Where do you go,  
Daddy where do you go?"  
  
I play the road,  
And this highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
Shaking off the miles  
(Shaking off the miles)  
(Mile after mile)  
Mile after mile  
Baby, I'm coming home

Moonshine
Free
----------------
Sitting in a graveyard  
Waiting for the dawn  
Leaning on my tombstone  
Till the night is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh how the moon  
Hangs in black sky  
Wish I could find out  
The reason why  
I sit here alone  
And cry  
  
My woman was so lovely  
Together we were one  
No sunshine in my weary eyes  
Now that she has gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Palm trees whisper to me  
From your spreading height  
Tell me all the lonely stories  
Of the world at night  
  
[Chorus]

Pesawat Tempurku
Iwan Fals
----------------
Waktu kau lewat aku sedang mainkan gitar  
Sebuah lagu yang kunyanyikan tentang dirimu  
Seperti kemarin kamu hanya lemparkan senyum  
Lalu pergi begitu saja bagai pesawat tempur  
Hey... !!! Kau yang manis singgahlah dan ikut bernyanyi  
Sebentar saja nona sebentar saja hanya sebentar  
Rayuan mautku tak membuat kau jadi galak  
Bagai seorang diplomat ulung engkau mengelak  
Kalau saja aku bukanlah penganggur sudah kupacari kau  
Jangan bilang tidak biang saja iya.................  
Iya lebih baik daripada kau menangis.................  
Reff:  
Penguasa.!!!!!!!!!!!! Penguasa!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Berilah hambamu uang  
Beri hamba uang!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beri hamba uang!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Oh Ya........... Andaikata dunia tak punya tentara  
Tentu tak ada perang yang banyak makan biaya  
Oh ya............ Andaikata dana perang buat diriku  
Tantu kau mau singgah bukan cuma tersenyum  
Kalau hanya senyum yang engkau berikan  
Westerling pun tersenyum  
Oh................ Singgahlah sayang....... Pesawat tempurku  
Mendarat mulus didalam sanubariku.............................

Still Within The Sound Of My Voice
Glen Campbell
----------------
Where have you gone, my darling one?  
Are you on your own?  
Are you having fun?  
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad?  
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had?  
  
Does a day go by like a memory?  
Do you ever try to remember me  
In an automobile or a crowded bar?  
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are  
  
And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio  
I just want you to know you were always my only choice  
And where ever you go then I still love you so,  
if you're still within the sound of my voice.  
  
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?  
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all  
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head?  
Was it really me talking to your heart instead?  
  
And if you are still within the sound of my voice  
watching this video, I just want you to know  
That it always made me rejoice  
Just to have you so near  
There's a place for you here  
If you're still within the sound of my voice.  
  
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries  
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies  
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress  
but only you can send a lifeline out to me.  
  
Are you still within the sound of my voice?  
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong  
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will  
Are you still within the sound of my voice  
  
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries  
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies

Unbroken
Zoegirl
----------------
1 2 3  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
Fallen to pieces  
(I am undone)  
The things you said  
(Manipulation)  
I trusted you like a fool  
While you made all the rules  
So you searched me out  
And you took me down  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
The things you found  
(To use against me)  
Have lost their sound  
(When mercy and truth meet)  
I fell to the Father's feet  
His words washed all over me  
And all the scars you made  
Watch them fade away  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet  
Embraced the victory, and some defeat  
I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet  
I found the beauty in the place they meet  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken

The Story Of 100 Aisles
Our Lady Peace
----------------
Help yourself  
If you know why you came  
Cause if you need help she says  
There's something I've got saved  
This is not what you wanted  
These candy coated fakes  
This is not what you wanted  
This is pain  
Anacin, we're stumbling again  
It's the story of a hundred aisles  
Walk away from simple on a tray  
Cause if you need help she says  
These fancy pills don't rate  
This is not what you wanted  
A miracle today  
Time is not for sale today  
Time seems so far away  
You need more than this  
Depressed come here try this

Wild For You Baby
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
Struck by the moon  
Risin' too soon  
I feel a pain deep inside me  
Cold northern winds  
Fist in my chin  
Makin' me wild for you baby  
  
What can I do  
To get back to you  
I'm feeling desperate and lonely  
The city's a river  
Of cold misery  
Makin' me wild for you baby  
  
I'm down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry  
  
Nites I can't sleep  
My tears are cheap  
I'm losin' hold of my senses  
I can't contain  
All of this pain  
And it's makin' me wild for you baby  
  
I'm down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry

Go Now
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
We've already said goodbye  
Since you gotta go, oh you better  
Go now, go now, go now, go now  
Go, before you see me cry  
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now  
'cause how many times do I have to tell you darlin',  
I'm still in love with you now  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh  
  
We've already said so-long  
I don't wanna see you go, oh you better  
Go now, go now, go now, go now  
Don't you even try  
Tellin' me that you don't want me to end up this way  
'cause darlin', darlin', can't you see I want you to stay, stay  
  
We've already said goodbye  
Since you gotta go, oh you better  
Go now, go now, go now, go now  
Go, go!  
  
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now  
'cause how many times do I have to tell you darling,  
I'm still in love still in love with you now  
  
I don't wanna see you go but darling, you better go now

Child In The Sun
Nazareth
----------------
I am just a child in the sun  
Just another soul on the run  
One more of your unwanted sons  
Tell me where can I go  
  
I had a line I tried for a while  
Now I'm walkin' mile after mile  
On my face no trace of a smile  
Why does time pass so slow  
  
Take me down to the river  
Take me down to the sea  
Where I can drown all my sorrows  
Wash all my troubles away  
Watch all my cares sail away  
  
I have no ties my hands are unbound  
There is no friend no love I have found  
I have no ups I'm fixed to the ground  
Tell me river where you flow.

Sweetness
Lloyd Cole
----------------
Oh, you're a precious little prude?  
But tell me the truth now  
Have you ever had a care in the world  
So tell me what's it all about  
You say oh you're so attacked  
Well you'll never be so right  
Oh you can cry yourself dry  
But i'd be surprised if you can munster  
Up a single crocodile  
You'll never be a hopeless child  
Throw caution to the wind  
Forgive yourself your sins  
And don't you know you  
Really are the sweetest thing  
There isn't heart enough from you  
Do you no longer care or feel that  
You no longer have nothing left to prove  
Oh tell me that it isn't true  
I wanted to tell you  
That I used to admire you  
Oh you know really that I don't cared  
No I never cared for you  
But I used to read about you  
And you oftenly would throw caution to the wind  
And don't you know you  
Really are the sweetest thing

Good Ride Cowboy
Garth Brooks
----------------
From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming,  
Where life's wooly and wild  
Came a Navy brat, In a cowboy hat  
And that Copenhagen smile  
  
And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks  
He always sang a cowboy song  
We were much to young, Having too much fun  
As we all sang along  
  
And we sang Life's a Highway  
There's only one way you're gonna get through it  
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes  
And them pickup-men are at your side  
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride."  
  
(Take a ride)  
  
Well gold buckles to gold records  
Once again he was spinnin' round  
Took the whole world on, And he turned us on  
To that Western underground  
  
And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat  
The songs were stronger than his pain  
He would not slow down, From town to town  
Like children running through the rain  
  
And he sang Life's a Highway  
There's only one way you're gonna get through it  
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes  
And them pickup-men are at your side  
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride."  
  
We sang Life's a Highway  
There's only one way you're gonna get through it (yeah!)  
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight ("let me have it!"), and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes  
And them pickup-men are at your side  
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride."  
  
Then he crossed that River Jordan  
With St. Peter on the other side  
Singin' "Good ride, cowboy, good ride"  
Say "Good ride, cowboy, good ride!"

What About Me
Quicksilver Messenger Service
----------------
You poisoned my sweet water.  
You cut down my green trees.  
The food you fed my children  
Was the cause of their disease.  
  
My world is slowly fallin' down  
And the airs not good to breathe.  
And those of us who care enough,  
We have to do something...  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh... oh What you gonna do about me?  
Oh... oh What you gonna do about me?  
  
Your newspapers,  
They just put you on.  
They never tell you  
The whole story.  
  
They just put your  
Young ideas down.  
I was wonderin' could this be the end  
Of your pride and glory?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I work in your factory.  
I study in your schools.  
I fill your penitentiaries.  
And your military too!  
  
And I feel the future trembling,  
As the word is passed around.  
"If you stand up for what you do believe,  
Be prepared to be shot down."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I feel like a stranger  
In the land where I was born  
And I live like an outlaw.  
An' I'm always on the run...  
  
An I'm always getting busted  
And I got to take a stand...  
I believe the revolution  
Must be mighty close at hand...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I smoke marijuana  
But I can't get behind your wars.  
And most of what I do believe  
Is against most of your laws  
  
I'm a fugitive from injustice  
But I'm goin' to be free.  
Cause your rules and regulations  
They don't do the thing for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I feel like a stranger  
In the land where I was born  
And I live just like an outlaw.  
An' I'm always on the run.

Leaving Me Behind
Nick Drake
----------------
The tramp moves on to the end of the street  
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet  
For some there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  
The world humes on at it's breakneck pace  
People fly in their lifelong race  
For them there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  
The chances they come, but the chances have been lost  
Success can be gained, but at too great a cost  
For some there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.  
The wind sweeps up and goes back to it's tree  
The rain flows by and moves to the sea  
For them there's a future to find  
But I think they're leaving me behind.

Christmas Mem'ries
Barbra Streisand
----------------
Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Making footprint in the snow  
Mem'ries  
  
Christmas Mem'ries  
They're the sweetest ones I know  
Cookies baking  
In the kitchen  
  
Cards and ribbons  
Everywhere  
Frosty Christmas Mem'ries  
Float like snowflakes in the air  
  
And oh the joy of waking X-mas morning  
The fam'ly round the tree  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
As merry as can be  
  
I close my eyes and see  
Shiny faces  
Of all the children  
Who now have children of their own  
  
Funny  
But come December'  
I remember every X-mas I've known  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
  
As merry as can be  
I close my eyes and see  
Those shiny faces  
Of all the children who now have children  
  
Of their own  
It's funny  
But come December  
When I remember  
  
Every X-mas I've ever known  
Singing carols  
Stringing popcorn  
Shiny faces of all the children  
  
Precious mem'ries  
Of every Christmas  
I've known...

Get Up
Kinks
----------------
Here's a song for all the little men, who get forgotten  
Trodden time and time again  
Here's a message for the little guy, don't let this situation pass you by  
You're in the middle while the big mouths fight  
You get it from the left and the right, ain't it crazy  
  
So get out of your easy chairs, we've got a lot to do out there  
Well ain't we  
Good's gone bad but right is wrong and I don't know which side I'm on lately  
  
Get up from the down you are in  
Come out of your homes and let's see your faces  
Get up out of your easy chairs, get up and show 'em that you're there  
Get up it's your one salvation  
Wise up to the situation  
  
Somebody gotta get up and shout  
Somebody gotta give us some clout  
You're the ones to make it all work out  
It all depends on you  
  
Get up off your arses men  
Don't let 'em think you're getting lazy  
Get up out of your easy chairs  
We gotta lot to do out there, well ain't we  
Get up, get up, get up,  
Get up, get up, get up

Spiderman
Ramones
----------------
Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies  
Look out, here comes the Spiderman  
  
Is he strong? Listen bud, he's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead  
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman  
  
In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime  
Like a streak of light he arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman  
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward  
Look out, here comes the Spiderman  
  
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman  
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward  
To him, life's a great big bang up, whenever there's a hang up,  
You'll find the Spiderman!

Ramones
----------------
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep, cover me in my dreams  
Carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run  
I got the bead on you, she fires true  
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do  
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun  
  
Triple-O bucks the only shot for me  
Cut any man right off at the knees  
Don't need to bother the police,  
I've got my Mossberg 590  
  
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep,  
Cover me in my dreams carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run  
I got the bead on you, she fires true  
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do  
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun  
  
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep,  
Cover me in my dreams carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, scattergun, scattergun

I Heard That Lonesome Whistle Blow
Johnny Cash
----------------
I was riding number nine  
Heading South from Caraloine  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
I got in trouble, had to roam  
I left my gal an' left my home  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
Just a kid, actin' smart  
I went and broke my darling's heart  
I guess I was too young to know  
  
They took me off the Georgia Main  
Locked me to a ball and chain  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All alone I bear the shame  
I'm a number, not a name  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All I do is sit an' cry  
When that evenin' train goes by  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
An' my hair turns whiter than snow  
  
I'll never see that gal of mine  
I'm in Georgia, doin' time  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

East Of The River
Wet Wet Wet
----------------
Let love shine  
  
Gotta gotta know  
I see the sun in your eyes  
Let me take your hand  
And we'll go to wonderland  
I bet you've asked silly questions  
Like do I still love you  
Better believe it, honey  
  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
  
They all went mad  
On the way out west, hells bells baby  
But you can bet your bottom dollar  
That my arch full flame  
May win you over, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back c'mon now baby  
I'm the lie that tells the truth  
  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
  
Where the grass is always greener  
And the pavements  
Are all paved with gold  
Please please don't be told  
C'mon I said east of the river  
  
I don't want to work for nobody but you  
  
You're the girl from the east of the river  
You're the girl from the east of the river  
You're the girl from the east of the river  
You're the girl from the east of the river

If It Wasn't For The Nights
ABBA
----------------
I got appointments, work I have to do  
Keepin' me so busy all the day through  
They're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you  
Oh baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it  
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say  
And I lose my temper ten times a day  
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
No-one to turn to, you know how it is  
I was not prepared for something like this  
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss  
Oh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it  
I got my business to help me through the day  
People I must write to, bills I must pay  
But everything's so different when night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights

Don't you know when you smile  
I've got to say you're my honey pumpkin lover  
You're my heart's delight  
Don't you want to go out tonight  
You're such a pretty lady  
You're such a sweet girl  
When you dance it brightens up my world  
Come on darling put a pretty dress on  
We're gonna go out tonight  
And dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
Dance, dance, dance  
All night long

Worried Life Blues
Chuck Berry
----------------
Oh lordy Lord, oh lordy Lord  
It hurts me so bad for us to part  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
So many nights since you've been gone  
I've had to worry my life along  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
How many times, how many times since you went away  
Have I set and cried and cried both night and day  
Someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
You're on my mind, baby, every place I go  
How much I love you, nobody knows  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
So that's my story, baby, this is all I got to say to you  
Bye-bye, baby, I don't care what you do  
Someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Ordinary Bummer
Iggy Pop
----------------
Lovely games of yesterday  
Have left me with my soul today  
Felicity flies out the door  
When people lose their warmth  
That's a very ordinary bummer  
I'll hold out for summer days  
  
Stand and laugh and run  
In a quiet movie of mine  
I saw a girl with eyes like fire  
I had to look away  
She was swearing like a sailor  
And demanding her own way  
That was when I knew I had to love her  
  
I opened up my sad old eyes  
And let the feelings run  
With a quiet beauty of mine  
Maybe sometimes we do bad things  
And then other times we do good  
And sometimes from something very bad  
Comes something very good  
In a quiet year of mine

Better Than A Dream (feat. Judy Holliday)
Dean Martin
----------------
with Judy Holliday  
  
  
  
Judy Holiday:  
  
  
  
So that's what you look like  
  
At last I know  
  
You're better better than a dream  
  
What you are is better far better than a dream  
  
Well I tried to picture your face  
  
But now I see you you're out of this world you're out of this sphere you're
out of that outer space  
  
Better better than a dream  
  
What is real is more ideal than a dream  
  
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream  
  
  
  
Dean:  
  
  
  
Can this be a dream  
  
Can I still be asleep on the couch there  
  
Can this girl be really here  
  
She seems to know by sheer intuition how I landed in this condition  
  
Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept
all year  
  
But it's not a dream 'cause look I've got some words on the paper  
  
Steady boy don't faint or scream  
  
Don't ask who sent you this angel it's better better than a dream

Scared Of Yourself
Zornik
----------------
You reach for pain  
You reach for fear  
You reach for everything  
But nothing ever comes your way  
  
And I'm not lying  
You always complain about the way I behave without you  
  
And last night I had a dream  
About it  
And it's very hard to stay faithful  
To a dream of you  
  
CHORUS:  
Think about the lies  
That we told to each other  
We never bothered  
What a big surprise  
That your scared of yourself  
And alone all again  
  
You reach for me  
You reach for us  
You reach for everything  
But nothing ever comes my way  
  
But you  
You are nothing but a state of mind  
From the start until the end  
  
CHORUS x 2

In Denial
Pet Shop Boys
----------------
In denial, no  
My life's a trial  
I'm not denying  
That every little bit hurts  
It's a problem  
That I'm not solving  
Don't mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while, getting away  
Before it gets any worse today  
  
You're in denial  
And that is final  
You're not admitting  
You should be quitting  
All these  
Queens and fairies  
And muscle Marys  
The rough trade boyfriend  
Who in his pathetic own way  
Denies he's gay  
Why can't you see?  
This is a fantasy world  
  
Think I'm going mad  
How do you know if you're  
Going mad?  
  
Look at me I'm lonely  
  
Look at me I'm sad  
  
I'm not denying  
I could be trying  
A little harder  
To deal with some of this stuff  
  
Know what I'm thinking?  
Less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes and you'd feel  
A little less rough  
  
Is that enough?  
My life is absurd, I'm living it  
Upside down  
Like a vampire, working at  
Night, sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows  
He's gay  
  
Can you love me anyway?

Introduction To Solution
Kinks
----------------
While the rich get their kicks with their affluent antics  
Mr. Black sits and ponders their fate.  
He just sits in the gloom of his dimly-lit room  
Waiting for them to swallow the bait.  
  
While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic  
And casually clocks their defeat.  
While the politicians cover up mistakes that they've made  
And all the promises, the lies and deceits.  
  
A military coup has been long overdue.  
Now there's fighting and panic in the streets.  
Amid the mass disillusion, disorder and confusion,  
He will rise now his plan is complete.  
  
But me, I'm only standing here  
Watching it all go on and I'm watching it all go wrong  
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near  
And I wish I could just disappear.  
  
While Flash and his men drink champagne in their den  
And debase life with crude ostentation,  
The poor cry for more, but they're reaching the point  
Where the people can't stand any more.  
  
But me, I'm only standing here  
Watching it all go on, and I'm watching it all go wrong  
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near  
And I wish I could just disappear.

Crazy
Wanda Jackson
----------------
Crazy  
I'm crazy for feelin' so lonely  
I'm crazy  
Crazy for feelin' so-o blue-ue  
  
I knew  
You'd love me  
As long as you wanted  
And the-en someday  
You'd leave me  
For somebody new-ew  
  
Worry  
Oh why do I let myself worry  
Wonderin'  
What in the wor-orld  
Did I do-oo-oo-oo-oo  
  
I'm crazy  
For thinkin' that my lo-ove  
Could hold you  
I'm crazy  
For tryin', crazy for cryin'  
And I'm crazy  
For lo-ovin' you  
  
Oh crazy  
For thinking that my lo-ove  
Could hold you  
I'm crazy for tryin'  
And crazy for cryin'  
And I'm crazy  
For lo-ovin' you-ou...

'Cross The Green Mountain
Bob Dylan
----------------
I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I, I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Can't be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
It's the last day's last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
There's blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair nature's light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
You're walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The ground's froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But he'll be better soon  
He's in a hospital bed  
But he'll never be better  
He's already dead  
  
I'm ten miles outside the city  
And I'm lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day  
  
They were calm, they were gloomed  
We knew them all too well  
We loved each other more than  
We ever dared to tell

Hallucinate
Def Leppard
----------------
Your a roxette  
Undeniable  
Unobtainable  
Is what you are  
In a word  
Indestructible  
Your a cannonball  
Your a star  
  
Gettin' wild  
Gettin' free  
Gettin' touched  
Can't you see  
Gettin' first gallantry  
Get your hands off of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hallucinate  
It's in your head  
Hallucinate  
In every word you say  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
It's more than you can take  
  
Its the way you act  
Its the way you feel  
In your Cadillac  
In your car  
Cause the sheer you wear  
Anything you dare  
Like a superstar  
Is what you are  
  
Let it loose  
Let it go  
Be the last to know  
Get it back  
Get on track  
Be the first to crow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gettin' wild  
Gettin' free  
Gettin' touched  
Can't you say  
Gettin' first gallantry  
Get your hands off of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallucinate  
It's in your head  
Hallucinate  
In every word you say  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucinate  
Its more than you can take  
  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate

Dedicated To The One I Love
Wilson Phillips
----------------
While I'm far away from you, my baby,  
I know it's hard for you, my baby,  
Because it's hard for me, my baby,  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn  
  
Each night before you go to bed, my baby,  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby.  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love.  
  
Love can never be exactly like we want it to be.  
I could be satisfied knowing you love me.  
There's one thing I want you to do especially for me  
And it's something that everybody needs.  
  
While I'm far away from you, my baby,  
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby,  
Because it's hard for me, my baby,  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn.  
  
If there's one thing I want you to do especially for me  
Then it's something that everybody needs  
  
Each night before you go to bed, my baby,  
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby,  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love.  
This is dedicated (to the one I love)  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
This is dedicated (to the one I love)  
This is dedicated

Don't Push
Sublime
----------------
Stolen from an Africa land  
Chased out with a knife  
With a face like Bob Marley and a mouth like a motor bike  
Oh well the bars are always open and the time is always right  
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
If I was Bob Marley I said could you be loved  
If I was Half Pint I'd ball the lord up above  
If I was Mike Tyson I'd look for a fight  
If I was a Boomtown Rats I would be stayin' up all night  
If I was the King Ad-Rock I would get stupid dumb  
If rhymes were Valiums I'd be comfortably numb  
  
If I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do,  
I'd point that shit straight at the sky  
And shoot heaven on down for you  
Because the bars are always open, and the time is always right  
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
I want a lover, I can't find the time  
I want a reason, I can't find the rhyme  
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford,  
Just lay on the ground like I fell off my skateboard  
Now a days, as clear as you please, strap with protection or strap with
disease.  
Laughter, it's free any time just call me  
439-0116 when your down with Sublime you get  
Funky fresh lyrics, you get nothin'  
  
Stolen from an Africa land  
Got chased out of the bar  
I saw my best friend tonight, so don't push me too far  
  
I'm gonna run come down with the new lyrics,  
Get hit get hip don't slip you knuckle heads  
Racism is schism on a serious tip  
You don't believe me that I won't bust your lip.  
I hear the mountain, it hard to climb  
Ruffle the rhythm and it must be Sublime  
Listen yellow lover yeah it right on time  
We got cricket with the quickness and the bass line  
  
Go and raid the sound and tell the people the news oh, hey  
Tell them reggae music is on the loose  
Here I am from the place where the sun keeps shine new style in a unique
fashion  
And good, good vibes that keep on playin', playin'  
  
People want to come up and they want to tell me smokin' crack cocaine better
than sensi  
You're pumpin' that shit yo we're sick of it  
Teakin' every weekend and we just can't take it  
We don't want plastic

Christmas Eve
Christmas Songs
----------------
Snow falling gently on the ground  
'Tis is the night before  
And in my heart there is no doubt  
That this is gonna be  
'Cause here you are with me  
Baby, baby, I can't wait  
  
To spend this special time of year with someone who  
Makes me feel the special way that you do  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
We'll stay up late tonight  
Decorate the tree  
Just look into my eyes  
And I will tell you truthfully  
That I don't need no Santa Claus  
To hear my Christmas wish  
I got you in my arms  
And what could be a better gift  
Than to spend my very favorite time of year  
With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeeeaahhh  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
And the bells are ringing when I hear you say  
We'll do it all again on Christmas Day  
I can't wait  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

Tiger In A Burning Tree
Everclear
----------------
A friend of mine woke me up to tell me about his dream  
All the lights in the world went black  
He felt like a tiger in a burning tree  
It was like he was late for something  
That he did not wanna see  
His life looks better on paper  
He lives like a tiger in a burning tree  
  
Blow out the candles and make a wish  
  
A woman from the city in the South  
She lost her cow when the bottom fell out  
She sold her life to the deep blue sea  
She left a message for the world to see  
She knows better what it's like to be  
A tiger in a burning tree  
  
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath  
Blow out the candles and look away  
  
I was a child that painted my toys angel blue and devil red  
I broke him into pieces, set them on fire  
Swept him under my bed  
I never learned how to play nice with all the other kids  
I never learned how to draw inside the lines and probably never will  
  
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath  
Imagine a world so much better than this  
Now close your eyes and jump to a place you attain to be  
And you can tell me what it feels like  
To be a tiger in a burning tree

I'm Hurting Inside
Bob Marley
----------------
When I was just a little child (little child)  
Happiness was there awhile (there awhile)  
And from me it... It slipped one day  
Happiness come back I say  
  
Cause if you don't come  
I've got to go looking  
For happiness  
  
Well if you don't come  
I've got to go looking  
God, for happiness, happiness  
  
Say that  
Say I'm hurting  
And it's no sense  
I'm hurting, I'm hurting  
Deep inside  
Oh good god now  
  
Oh hear my cry, hear my cry  
Yeah my my my my my my my cry  
  
Been together like school children (school children)  
Then you hurt me just in vain (just in vain)  
Oh, Lord, I'm your weary child  
Oh, happiness come back awhile  
  
Cause if you don't come  
I'm gonna go looking  
For happiness (the road is dangerous)  
I've got to go looking  
For happiness, happiness  
  
Said I'm  
Don't you know I'm  
I'm hurting, hurting inside  
Oh I'm hurting  
Who cares  
Who cares  
  
Does the one who love, oh  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain  
  
Does the one who love  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain

Love Is A Many Splendored Thing
Engelbert Humperdinck
----------------
Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing  
  
Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Can't Get High
Widespread Panic
----------------
I've been working all day  
I've been shaking it loose  
It's been raining for hours  
I've been spilling my juice  
Nothing means nothing  
I couldn't care less  
And now that you're gone,  
I can't even guess  
I've got snakes in my cellar  
I've got blood in my bed  
Bombs in the closet  
They're all painted cherry red  
And a feel like a mad scientist  
I've got loose change in my head  
Nothing but trouble these days  
I eat bullets in my bread  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Violent romantic  
On a seven day binge  
Losin' a gamble  
But I get my revenge  
Start thinking about thunder  
And I get mad again  
Soaking up electricity  
Like bourbon and gin  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Hallucinated green light  
And I slammed on the gas  
My performance ain't perfect  
But it's loud and it's fast  
Set sail for the new world  
And I burned down the mast  
Well, it wasn't the first time  
And I know it won't be the last  
  
Now that you're gone, honey,  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't - get - right  
Get right

Georgia Woods
Keith Urban
----------------
What kind of spell is this  
That you've cast on me with your kiss  
Its like I've lost all control of my senses  
Its just not like me, to give in so easily  
And drop my guard and leave my heart defenseless  
Oh, but I'm feelin' good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a surprise, here by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
I waited so long, for something this strong  
And now I gotta be fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you baby  
  
There's nobody here to see  
These sparks between you and me  
We'd better be careful my love, or these woods will be burning  
Or maybe we just give in, throwing caution to the wind  
Its funny how we ain't got any say in the matter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh huh  
Oh take me downtown  
Uh huh  
My sweet angel  
  
Yeah, I waited so long, somethin' is strong  
And I know I'm falling 'cause I'm already callin' you  
Oh  
  
What a surprise, hear by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
Oh waited so long, for something this strong  
And we know I'm fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you  
Oh callin' you baby  
Yeah, uh huh

Proclaimers
----------------
Warmongers, kill yourselves  
Demonstrate the power of the product  
That you're trying to sell  
Gun wavers, shoot yourselves  
Make a big hole in your head with a shiny shell  
What's wrong with that kind of vision?  
What's wrong with that kind of world?  
If I suffered less from indecision  
I'd stand on that platform myself  
Chickenhawks, there's a cell  
Down in hell, where you may fight aswell  
If I may paraphrase John Lennon  
Why fill this world with more pain and fear?  
To every budding Mark Chapman  
I offer these words most sincere  
Warmongers, kill yourselves  
Demonstrate the power of the product  
That you're trying to sell  
Gun wavers, shoot yourselves  
Make a big hole in your head with a shiny shell  
Do it yourself

I Won't Forget You
Loretta Lynn
----------------
I know that I won't forget you  
For I've loved you too much for too long  
Though you don't want me now  
I'll still love you till the breath in my body is gone  
That's how it is with me  
And you'll always be the only love I ever knew  
I'll forget many things in my lifetime  
But darling I won't forget you  
  
That's how it is with me  
And you'll always be the only love I ever knew  
I'll forget many things in my lifetime  
But darling I won't forget you

Buried Alive
Yeah Yeah Yeahs
----------------
Free yourself that leash is long long long [x4]  
  
[Repeat x4]  
I dreamt  
I was buried alive  
  
Prognostic figure of speech to manifesto  
Dr. Octagon move in the dark though  
Multiply darkness, I'm the bright artist  
Hologram image on the interface  
Manage the code to bury them alive  
Manage the code to bury them inside  
Show smoke from the smoke machine  
Lights on the top flash purple and green  
Purple and mean, rise with the vampires  
Look over skies from a high-rise  
Doc Oc operate by the clock  
Medicine bag come down by your block  
Raise the dead, hypnotize with your head  
Chemical react surgery to your head  
Eyeballs up all night turn red  
  
Free yourself that leash is long long long [x4]  
  
I was buried alive, I was buried alive, I was buried alive [x4]  
  
Turn red, turn red, turn red, turn red, turn red

Slow Burn
Doobie Brothers
----------------
Woke up this mornin'  
Jumped to my feet  
Ran to the window  
And down in the street  
The paperboy was jumpin'  
Like a monkey on a leash  
Yellin', read all about it  
Read all about it  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Down on Sunset  
In the summertime  
It gets so hot you think you're goin' blind  
Little girls all dressed up  
And they're ready to go out  
Makes me wanna shout  
Makes me wanna shout  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
You've got nowhere to go  
No one to go there with  
Ain't nobody cares about anything you did  
Lookin' for trouble  
You've got plenty on your mind  
Now we'll read all about it  
Read all about it, baby  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town

Dance The Night Away
Van Halen
----------------
Have you seen her? So fine and pretty  
Fooled me with her style and ease  
And I feel her from across the room  
Yes, it's love in the third degree  
  
Ooh, baby baby  
Won't-cha turn your head my way?  
Ooh, baby baby  
Ah come on! Take a chance  
You're old enough to  
  
Dance the night away  
Whoa-oh (Ah) Come on g-girl, dance the night away  
  
A live wire, barely a beginner  
But just watch that lady go  
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than-uh  
Anything else she knows  
  
Ooh, baby baby  
Won't-cha turn your head my way?  
Ooh, baby baby  
Well don't skip romance 'cause  
You're old enough to  
  
Dance the night away  
Oh-oh-oh (Ah) Come on g-girl, dance the night away

Sensible
Face To Face
----------------
Someone tell me that I'm wrong  
Someone tell me that I'm right  
Someone tell me where I'm going  
  
I guess it's safe to say  
I don't know what I want  
But I can't wait forever  
It isn't difficult at all  
I don't know what I want  
But I can't wait forever  
It isn't difficult at all  
  
It makes no sense to me  
  
Someone tell me that it's black  
Someone tell me that it's white  
Someone tell me that it's going to make a difference  
  
I don't know what I want  
But I can't wait forever  
It isn't difficult at all  
It makes no sense to me

Black Eye
Uncle Tupelo
----------------
He had a black eye  
He was proud of  
Like some of his friends  
It made him feel somewhere outside  
Of everything and everywhere he'd been  
  
Like his brothers  
He emptied himself  
And played it safe  
Like their father  
He wanted to remember  
But he almost always  
Forgot what he was gonna say  
  
Black eye  
Black eye  
  
When he realized  
That this one was here to stay  
He took down  
All the mirrors in the hallway  
And thought only of his younger face  
  
Black eye  
Black eye

Searching For A Heart
Warren Zevon
----------------
Darkness in the morning  
Shadows on the land  
Certain individuals  
Aren't sticking with the plan  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
Leaving in the evening  
Traveling at night  
Staying inconspicuous  
I'm staying out of sight  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
They tell me love requires a little standing in line  
And I've been waiting for you, lover, for a long, long time  
I've been pacing the floor  
I've been watching the door  
Meanwhile I'll keep searching for a heart  
Searching high and low for you  
Trying to track you down  
Certain individuals  
Have finally come around  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
They tell me love requires a little standing in line  
And I've been waiting for you, lover, for a long, long time  
I've been pacing the floor I've been watching the door  
Meanwhile I'll keep searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car

Pressure
Michael Jackson
----------------
Why can't you admit  
You've done of what's you've told  
Like the dog waiting for the bone  
You greed, can't you, just tell the truth  
You did what you have to,  
And so you decided to sold me, out (for the money)  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you  
  
Close your eyes and count to the ten,  
This won't take a long, just a few seconds (left ahead)  
It doesn't hurt so much either, I'll promise it  
(From all my heart, why would I lie to you my friend)  
  
The pain you made, the pressure you gave  
I held it all, inside of me 'til I past  
Now I shall salute you, the assassin of 2012  
Are you clapping your hands together, that's what I assume  
  
Tonight you'll suffer with the endless pain,  
Dying while dreaming of my forgiveness,  
So this time, I feel like I win  
  
You should just left me on my own  
And take those steps back before you told  
That you can be trusted but seems like you don't  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, doesn't it hurt and yeah, I love you.

Both Ends Burning
Roxy Music
----------------
Please don't ever let me down  
'Cause you know I'm not so sure  
Do I have the speed to carry on  
Burn you out of my mind, I know  
You're a flame that never fades  
Jungle red's a deadly shade  
Both ends burning, will the fires keep  
Somewhere deep in my soul tonight  
Both ends burning  
Burning  
Burn  
  
Now my course is plain as day  
Running bold across to play  
Both ends burning with a strange desire  
That feeds the fire in my soul tonight  
I will dance the night away  
Living only for today  
Both ends burning while you're counting sheep  
Hell, who can sleep in this heat this night?  
Tell me will I ever learn?  
  
It's too late, the rush is on  
Both ends burning and I can't control  
The fires raging in my soul tonight  
Oh will it never end?  
Put your foot around the bend  
Drive me crazy to an early grave  
Tell me what is there to save tonight  
Both ends burning  
Burning  
Burn  
  
Keep on burning till the end, until the end  
Keep on burning till the end, the very end

Time Is Passing
Who
----------------
I'm playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jar  
The glass sets up a sound like people laughing  
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain  
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing  
Mmm.  
I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me  
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish  
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around  
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing  
Find it, I got to hear it all again  
My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it, as my tears fall again  
It's only by the music I'll be free  
There's something in the whisper of the trees  
Millions hear it, still they can't believe  
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves  
As an empire of dead men leave their graves  
Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls  
Don't listen to me or words from men above  
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greeds  
Just hear it in the sound of time a-passing  
Find it, I got to hear it all again  
My heart has heard the sound of harmony  
Blind to it, as my tears fall again  
It's only by the music I'll be free

Red Right Hand
Nick Cave
----------------
Take a litle walk to the edge of town  
Go across the tracks  
Where the viaduct looms,  
Like a bird of doom  
As it shifts and cracks  
Where secrets lie in the border fires,  
In the humming wires  
Hey man, you know  
You're never coming back  
Past the square, past the bridge,  
Past the mills, past the stacks  
On a gathering storm comes  
A tall handsome man  
In a dusty black coat with  
A red right hand  
  
He'll wrap you in his arms,  
Tell you that you've been a good boy  
He'll rekindle all the dreams  
It took you a lifetime to destroy  
He'll reach deep into the hole,  
Heal your shrinking soul  
Hey buddy, you know you're  
Never ever coming back  
He's a god, he's a man,  
He's a ghost, he's a guru  
They're whispering his name  
Through this disappearing land  
But hidden in his coat  
Is a red right hand  
  
You ain't got no money?  
He'll get you some  
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one  
You ain't got no self-respect,  
You feel like an insect  
Well don't you worry buddy,  
Cause here he comes  
Through the ghettos and the barrio  
And the bowery and the slum  
A shadow is cast wherever he stands  
Stacks of green paper in his  
Red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
You'll see him in your nightmares,  
You'll see him in your dreams  
He'll appear out of nowhere but  
He ain't what he seems  
You'll see him in your head,  
On the tv screen  
And hey buddy, I'm warning  
You to turn it off  
He's a ghost, he's a god,  
He's a man, he's a guru  
You're one microscopic cog  
In his catastrophic plan  
Designed and directed by  
His red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack):  
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake  
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake  
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't  
Getting near much as he will take.  
  
He's a...  
  
He's mumbling words you can't understand  
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.

I Love
Tom T. Hall
----------------
I love little baby ducks, old pickup trucks  
Slow-movin' trains and rain  
I love little country streams, sleep without dreams  
Sunday school in May and hay  
And I love you, too  
  
I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends  
Birds of the world and squirrels  
I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups  
Bourbon in a glass, and grass.  
And I love you, too  
  
I love honest, open smiles, kisses from a child  
Tomatoes on the vine and onions  
I love winners when they cry, losers when they try  
Music when it's good and life  
And I love you, too.

Secrets
Tears For Fears
----------------
It seems we caused a forest fire  
With just a flicker of a flame  
And now I set alight to everything  
Now all I do is cause you pain  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child  
  
I used to think the time would come  
When man would rise above the beast  
I gave up thinking that way long ago  
In conversation with a priest  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child  
  
We could have heal this blindness  
With some human kindness  
I know secrets kill you  
But my love can fill you  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
  
It would be so fine  
If you could be mine  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child

Heavenly Houseboat Blues
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
I'm building a houseboat in heaven  
To sail those deep and holy seas  
I'm building a houseboat in heaven  
And it's welcome aboard you sweet peace  
  
The bow she is made of solid silver  
And the hall she is made of solid gold  
She ain't much long the line's a-floating  
But she's yours, babe, to have and to hold  
  
I rode my old guitar to heaven  
But heaven didn't feel too much like home  
So I'm headed out on to them lonesome oceans  
In my rubystudded houseboat to roam

One Of Those Days
Weird Al Yankovic
----------------
Got to work late 'cause my alarm was busted  
The boss chewed me out and everybody's disgusted  
'Cause it's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
I lost one of my socks in the drier  
I can't find my wallet and my hair is on fire  
Just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree  
A big swarm of locusts is following me  
There's not even anything good on TV  
It's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
Left all my Beatles records out in the sun  
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue  
It's just one of those days  
Gonna be one of those days  
  
The Nazis tied me up and covered me with ants  
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants  
Just one of those days  
Ever have one of those days?  
  
The bank called me up and told me I'm overdrawn  
Some freaks are burnin' crosses out on my front lawn  
And I can't believe it, all the Cheetos are gone!  
It just...just one of those, one of those days  
Just one of those, one of those days  
  
The F.B.I. has got a tap on my phone  
Those darn Russian spies won't leave me alone  
Shouldn't have got up this morning, shoulda known  
It's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
A 747 crashed into my den  
And there's nothin' but tater tots for dinner again  
It's just one of those days  
Never mind, it's just one of those days  
  
Big steamroller just ran over my mom  
And I cut myself shaving and they're dropping the bomb  
It's just one of those days  
That's all, it's just one of those days  
  
Then late at night, just before I go to bed  
The world blows up and now everybody's dead  
You just can't deny it, it's just like I said  
Just...just one of those, one of those days  
Just one of those days, one of those days

Cry Baby
Gino Vannelli
----------------
Cry baby shed a thousand tears  
Cry baby 'til all the dry land disappears  
You can sugar-coat the truth  
With all sweetness and light  
You can beg me for mercy  
But pardon my spite  
Cry it's your turn tonight  
Cry baby for all the good times we had  
Cry baby no the good don't outshine the bad  
You can grease me with kisses  
'til your red lips turn blue  
Offer me affection  
But what good would it do  
Cry like I cried for you  
I'm tired of making love together  
When you're apt to forget my given name  
It's over it's finished and what's better  
I am completely without pain  
Cry baby like a cloudburst in the sky  
Cry baby in other words goodbye  
You can try to move a mountain  
Attempt to calm the sea  
You'd sooner raise a dead man  
Than my deep sympathy  
Cry it don't matter to me  
It's over it's finished and what's better  
I am completely without pain  
Cry baby oooh  
Cry baby in other words goodbye  
You can try to move a mountain  
Attempt to calm the sea  
You'd sooner raise a dead man  
Than my deep sympathy  
Cry it just don't matter to me  
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry  
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry  
I want you to cry cry cry cry cry  
Cry baby cry baby  
Cry cry cry cry cry  
Cry cry cry cry cry  
Cry cry cry cry cry

Hard Luck
Elvis Presley
----------------
Oh I'm really feeling mighty low  
No, no, no, I got no place that I can go  
So I've got some blues to sing  
And oh, so much remembering, woe  
  
Black cats, keep away from me  
Take my advice, go shinning up a tree  
I got hard luck, the hardest kind a luck you'll find  
I ain't lyin', I've got the bluest kinda blues  
Drivin' me right outta my mind  
  
She's gone, said toodle-loo  
Kissed her good-bye and my-my, my money too  
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck you've seen  
I mean, the way I'm runnin' lately  
My lucky number is thirteen  
  
Where do I belong, everything I do is wrong, all wrong  
Wrong as can be  
Who's stacking all the decks, lady luck has got the hex on me  
I'm on her knee  
  
Shove off, oh I'm warning you  
This thing I caught, you know could be catchin' too  
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck there can be  
Yes siree, I guess hard luck always chooses  
Natural born losers like me

Sweet Toxic Love (Deliverance Mix)
Culture Club
----------------
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
  
I'm not your lover, I wanna be your friend  
But I need something, do you comprehend?  
It took a long time for this heart to mend  
There's something wrong with the love you send  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up to make me insane  
  
I'm not your punch bag I'm not your floor  
You can't walk on me until you get bored  
Before you break it, you must be sure  
That you can't use this love no more  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up, to make me insane  
  
God would have loved you but he never had the chance  
Love it means nothing till it's slipping through your hands  
And all the people with their problems and their plans  
Though it's nothing new for me and you, I still know who I am  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up, to make me insane  
  
Oh Lord, gimme stregth  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love

Change
Oingo Boingo
----------------
Don't you ever wonder why, nothing ever seems to change  
If it does it's for the worse, seems it's just a modern curse  
Sometimes when I take a peek outside of my little cage,  
Everyone looks so asleep, will they die before they wake  
And, hey. . . Don't you know? We're just products of our time and Hey . . .  
What d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Better dumb and happy than smart and without any friends  
Better cute and better loud, better join up with the crowd  
Keep up or be left behind, there's a dust storm in my mind  
Seems I can't see straight these days, doesn't matter anyway  
Hey . . . Don't you know? We're just products of our times and  
Hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -  
Oh God, here's that question now. The one that makes me go insane  
I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change  
Do you want to change? Do you want to change right now?  
Do you want to change . . . I like my stupid life, just the way it is  
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs  
And I like you just the way you are, I like your face just the way it is  
And I wouldn't even change it for a herd of screaming kids  
And I like you just the way you are, I like you though you may not like me
back  
I would dazzle you with brilliance, if I only had the knack  
'Cause I like you just the way you are, I like this life just the way it is  
And the castles all around me, have been melting now for years  
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here  
All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears  
And I'm dreaming again . . . Floating in a pool of mud  
Try to get back where I was and I don't really care  
Got a little talking to, by the mirror in my room, and I don't really care . .
.  
Whispering voices from the dead, come from underneath my bed  
And I don't really care . . .  
I like my stupid life just the way it is  
And the chaos that surrounds me like a flock of screaming pigs  
And it hurts my brain to think of all the stupid things I've said  
And if I could change the future I would change the past instead  
And I'm dreaming again . . . and I'm dreaming again . . .  
Baby - sometimes I worry about you  
Sometimes you're so far away, tell me what to do  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you  
Sometimes I just can't believe everything you do  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you  
Every day I feel the same, don't you feel it too  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Seems I'm falling down a lot, in between the scenes  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Getting harder all the time, harder now to see  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Light another cigarette, have another dream  
It's the same thing every day, nothing ever seems to change and I . . .  
Do you really want to change?  
Testaments and growing pains. Tranquilizers for the soul.  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained - evolution's cruelest joke  
Why is everyone upset? I once knew but I forget. Something happened,  
Something strange, something it appears has changed  
Hey . . . Don't you know? We're just products of our times  
And hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -  
Oh God, here's that question now, the one that makes me go insane  
I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change

Space Station No 5
Iron Maiden
----------------
Start, with the sun  
And move on out  
The future's in the skies above  
The heavens unfold  
And a new star is born  
Space and time makin' love  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh what a time we had  
Living on the ground  
I've moved to station No. 5  
See you next time around,  
Next time around  
  
As far you want, as close as you need  
It's all in the mind, you know  
This old world hasn't really seen it's day  
It's here, time to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember when it was so clear  
We were young, but the memory still remains  
To pick fruit from a tree  
Fish from the seas  
Now nothing's left here, but the stains  
Well I can't cry no more  
Can only be glad  
There's other places we can be  
If the time suits you right  
I'm leaving tonight  
Come fly away with me  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Start, with the sun  
And move on out  
The future's in the skies above  
The heavens unfold  
A new star is born  
Space and time makin' love  
  
[Chorus]

Old man sailin' in a dinghy boat  
Down there  
Old man down is baitin' a hook  
On there  
Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook  
Gonna pull man into the suckling brook

Oh yeah!  
Who's on the table, who's to tell me?  
Oh yeah!  
Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell?  
The forty-nine of you like bats out of hell  
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree

Paradise
Coldplay
----------------
When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach  
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of  
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise  
Every time she closed her eyes  
  
When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth  
Life goes on, it gets so heavy  
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall  
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes  
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly  
  
And dream of para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)  
  
She'd dream of para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)  
  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
And so lying underneath those stormy skies  
She'd say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I know the sun must set to rise"  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Would you believe me if I said  
That we are the ones who can make the change  
In the world today  
Would you believe me if I said  
That all of the dreams in your heart  
Can come true today  
Would you believe me if I said  
That life could be all that you want it to be today  
  
And if I had wings I would fly  
'cause all that I need You are  
And if the world caved in around me  
  
To You I'd still hold on  
'cause Your all that I believe  
And the one that created me  
Jesus because of You I'm Free  
  
Would you believe me if I said  
That God can make miracles happen today  
Would you believe me if I said  
That you don't need to wait for the answer before  
You step out in faith  
Would you believe me if I said  
That nothin' is ever impossible for God  
  
Just live you life with God inside  
You won our regret one moment of it  
And give all that you can for God. for God

The Lark In The Clear Air
John McDermott
----------------
The lark in the clear air : to my sister margaret  
  
Dear thoughts are in my mind  
And my soul soars enchanted  
As I hear the sweet lark sing  
In the clear air of the day  
For a tender beaming smile  
To my hope has been granted  
And tomorrow she shall hear  
All my fond heart would say  
I should tell her all my love  
All my soul's adoration  
And I think she will hear me  
And will not say me nay  
It is this that gives my soul  
All it's joyous elation  
As I hear the sweet lark sing  
In the clear air of the day

The Raging Storm
W.A.S.P.
----------------
[Jesse to God]  
  
A storm is come  
One war of sun and rain - within me  
A raging storm  
Lost crossroads thundering - in the wind  
Dark and son  
Who's the only one  
To lay claim of me  
Altars of store  
Righteous temptations  
Here at my feet  
  
Give me love  
To rage in me can you see?  
Only love  
Is saving me  
Give me love, oh love  
That rage in me  
  
It rages on  
Of mourn and memories  
In the wind  
A warring storm  
My soul is bargaining - in the end  
Is there no sun?  
With only love in vain - and it's pain  
Hear me oh Lord  
Cleanse me evermore with  
Your blood of rain  
  
Holy war for my soul  
Scares of memories remain  
Oh, tell me why am I here  
Storms of crossroads are rage

Well, you can see her walkin' down on Peachtree Street  
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek  
She's lookin' good, she's headed downtown  
Ain't got no money, honey  
She knows her way around  
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
  
Well these Georgia Peaches  
Son they know their way around  
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town  
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine  
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime  
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
  
Well, peaches, peaches  
Love them Georgia Peaches  
Well, peaches, peaches  
Love them Georgia Peaches  
  
Well them Georgia Peaches  
Sure do got the style  
They'll steal your heart with a Southern smile  
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine  
  
The older they get, I swear its like good wine  
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
  
I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things

Deacon Blues
Steely Dan
----------------
This is the day of the expanding man  
That shape is my shade  
There where I used to stand  
It seems like only yesterday  
I gazed through the glass  
At ramblers, wild gamblers  
That's all in the past  
  
You call me a fool  
You say it's a crazy scheme  
This one's for real  
I already bought the dream  
So useless to ask me why  
Throw a kiss and say goodbye  
I'll make it this time  
I'm ready to cross that fine line  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll learn to work the saxophone  
I play just what I feel  
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long  
And die behind the wheel  
They got a name for the winners in the world  
And I want a name when I lose  
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide  
Call me Deacon Blues  
  
My back to the wall  
A victim of laughing chance  
This is for me  
The essence of true romance  
Sharing the things we know and love  
With those of my kind  
Libations  
Sensations  
That stagger the mind  
  
I crawl like a viper  
Through these suburban streets  
Make love to these women  
Languid and bittersweet  
I'll rise when the sun goes down  
Cover every game in town  
A world of my own  
I'll make it my home sweet home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the night of the expanding man  
I take one last drag  
As I approach the stand  
I cried when I wrote this song  
Sue me if I play too long  
This brother is free  
I'll be what I want to be

Azwethinkweiz
Incubus
----------------
Floatin' round my brain,  
Tryin' to think about the other thing.  
Than that thought you know I'm considering.  
What if what I thought,  
About who I think I though I was,  
Was nothing more than my cerebellum slobbering?  
Azwethinkweizm is hard to think about,  
But simple to trust.  
  
You'll know your on it  
When your brain won't stop to take a break, no!  
So when donut boy comes askin' around,  
Tryin' to figure out somethin' new,  
You just smile and say,  
"Pardon you! I'm sifting through  
Some particles and farcing through some folds.  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds!"  
  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinkin' about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught!  
Well I think I thought  
I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
  
Some think I'm insane,  
'Cause I think about the other thing,  
Than that one thought you call reality.  
What if what you thought,  
About who you think you thought you were,  
Was nothing more than illusion rapidly crumbling!  
Azwethinkweism should be a topic we all can trust.  
  
It's just to bad it makes your  
Head go zippity crack dang!  
So when donut boy comes sniffing around  
Trying to figure out something new,  
You just laugh and say, "Pardon you,  
I'm sifting through some particles and  
Farcing through some folds.  
  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds."  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinking about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught.  
  
Well I think I thought I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
So what if you thought about the thinkweiz  
Was nothing like you think you are?  
You'd probably more than likely be a  
Looky-loo lookin' like you think you do.  
Like you think you do.

We Were Born To Fly
Scorpions
----------------
Hello again  
You've been alone awhile  
And I can use a friend  
Your shades are down  
And I've been waiting here for you to come around  
And it's not about forgiveness  
Cause it's all about the love anyhow  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
  
Take another breath  
Just close your eyes my love let nature do the rest  
Open up your wings  
And with the wind we'll rise above to higher things  
We'll forget about tomorrow  
And we'll live another day today  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
We were born to fly  
To reach beyond the sky  
To carry on forever after  
You and I  
You keep my faith alive  
With you I'm not afraid  
To rise and fall and face disaster  
You and I  
We were born to fly

Anarchy In The Uk
Megadeth
----------------
Right now  
I am an anti-Christ  
And I am an anarchist  
Don't know what I want, but I know how get it  
I want to destroy, possibly?  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, no dog's body  
Anarchy for the U.S.A.  
It's coming sometime, it may be  
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light  
Your future dream is a shopping spree  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, in the city  
Of many ways to get what you want  
I use the best, I use the rest  
I use the enemy  
I use anarchy  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, it's the only way to be  
Is this the M.P.L.A.?  
Is this the U.D.A.?  
Is this the I.R.A.?  
I thought it was the U.S.A., or just another country  
And other cunt-like tendencies  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, 'cause I want to be  
Anarchy, you know what I mean?  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchist, again I'm pissed  
Destroy!

Had a dream about you, baby  
Had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and I woke up cryin'  
Well, I can try but I just can't stop  
And the time is draggin' by, tick-tock  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you  
  
Well, I'm high and dry and lonely  
I'm as lonesome as can be  
And I stare out of my window  
Well, I can play but I just can't win  
And the weather's lookin' mighty grim  
Oh my heart, it just can't love no one but you

Cereal Killer
Quincy Punx
----------------
Wake in the morning my mind is all confused  
Don't no where to turn or what to do, pour myself  
A great big bowl of crispy bits of rice, the cereal  
That talks gives me some advice  
  
[Chorus]  
My rice krispies told me to kill you tonight  
My rice krispies never lie  
My rice krispies  
  
Told me so many things you see, like how the  
Phone company killed kennedy, how oprah is an  
Alien and nixon never lied, and by tommorow  
Morning you gotta die [chorus] this morning  
Breakfast message was so crystal clear  
It was so strange I couldn't believe my ears  
  
My cereal informed me your an agent for  
The feds, the CIA they want me dead  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Elvis is alive living in New Jersey  
That's right they gotta give me a lobotomy  
One day the aliens are gonna come for me  
I gotta kill you if I wanna be free

The Howler
King Crimson
----------------
Here is the angel of the world's desire  
Placed on trial  
To hide in shrouded alley silhouettes  
With cigarette coiled  
To strike at passing voices  
Dark and suspect  
Here is the howling ire  
  
Here is the sacred face of rendezvous  
In subway sour  
Whose grand delusions prey like intellect  
In lunatic minds  
Intent and focused on  
The long thin matches  
To light the howling fire  
  
No, no, not me,  
Burn, I don't want to burn

A Place In The Sun
Diana Ross
----------------
Like a long lonely stream  
I keep runnin' towards a dream  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
Like a branch on a tree  
I keep reachin' to be free  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
'Cause there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
Yeah, there's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Gotta find me a place in the sun  
  
Like an old dusty road  
I get weary from the load  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
Like this tired, troubled earth  
I've been rollin' since my birth  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
There's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
I know, there's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Gotta find me a place in the sun  
  
You know, when times are bad  
And you're feeling sad  
I want you to always remember  
  
Yes, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
Yeah, I know, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
Yeah, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone

2000 Light Years From Home
Rolling Stones
----------------
Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion  
We're setting off with soft explosion  
Bound for a star with fiery oceans  
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home  
  
Freezing red deserts turn to dark  
Energy here in every part  
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home  
  
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home  
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home  
  
Bell flight fourteen you now can land  
Seen you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand  
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home  
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home

Fishing
Widespread Panic
----------------
Inspirtation,  
Oh, she barely waits a moment  
Elevator doors open  
Hear her footsteps touch the stairs  
  
Words walk by  
Describing definition  
Stop and talk about it  
  
Narcissus  
Is just too easy to see  
We're always looking  
When we see fishes  
When we go fishin'  
  
Thoughts meander  
Risin' all around us  
Rise and fall and rise again  
Oh, we stop and talk about it  
  
Strong beliefs  
Like ideas come to life  
Turn atoms into rain and stone  
Sands and tall trees  
  
Worlds passed by  
Defyin' description  
Stop and talk about it  
Talk about it  
  
And Maia, she dances  
She dissolves into the light  
Illusions of light  
Oh Maia, she dances  
  
Deep romance and poetry  
Songs and movies  
Virtue for la de da  
She dances in the light  
Dance in the light  
  
Maia, she dances  
Oh Maia, she dances

Bury Me Deep
Hank Snow
----------------
Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
(Dark and cold and all alone)  
Tired of life all alone and  
Blue happiness I never knew  
In this cold world  
There's nothing for me now  
Won't you hear my only plea  
And bury me deep  
Where the sun doesn't shine  
Because sunshine I've never known  
Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
Dark and cold and all alone  
You were my love  
Only love I knew  
And tonight I find I can't have you  
Trouble and tears are all that I see  
Now you are gone please hear my plea  
Bury me deep where the sun...

Trash
Korn
----------------
How did it start?  
Well, I don't know.  
I just feel the craving.  
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.  
And it's just there for the taking.  
These little girls they make me feel so goddamn  
Exhilarated.  
I feel them up, I can't give it up.  
The pain that I'm just erasing.  
I tell my lies and I despise.  
Every second I'm with you.  
So I run away and you still stay.  
So what the fuck is with you.  
  
Your feelings I can't help but rape them.  
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.  
My heart inside is constantly hating.  
I'm sorry I just throw you away.  
  
I don't know why I'm so fucking cold?  
I don't know why it hurts me.  
All I want to do is get with you.  
And make the pain go away.  
Why do I have a conscience?  
All it does is fuck with me.  
Why do I have this torment?  
All I want to do is fuck it away.  
  
I tell my lies and I despise.  
Every second I'm with you.  
So I run away and you still stay.  
So what the fuck is with you.  
  
Your feelings I can't help but rape them.  
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.  
My heart inside is constantly hating.  
I'm sorry I just throw you away.  
  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.

I Need You Like This Hole In My Head
Sting
----------------
Lady Dolphin and her dolphin beau  
Were swimming out to sea one day  
All the other lady dolphins smiled  
But they were smiling in that subtle dolphin way  
  
So they pretended that they'd pay it no mind  
But she was female, of the jealous kind  
She couldn't stand it - not to ask him why  
She could see that he was flattered by the twinkle in his eye  
  
She said, "How much do you need me?  
How much do you need me?  
Would you stay with me till this ocean floor is dry?  
But if you cannot find the words that say  
I'm the only one you love that way  
I guess we'll have to say goodbye."  
  
He said, "My love for you is wider than the wide Sargasso Sea  
There ain't no bigger number, I know, but  
I never counted every ripple on the sea."  
  
He said that words had never failed him yet  
"But before our future course is set  
I have to find a way to win you, dear  
But there's two atmospheres of pressure on me here"  
  
"How much do I need you? How much do I need you?  
Can't seem to find the words to make you stay  
But remember all the things I've said  
That I'll love you till the day I'm dead  
'Cause I need you like this hole in my head  
I need you like this hole in my head

You And I
Enrique Iglesias
----------------
You and I  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
All I need is your hand  
And your heart  
  
Let's be free  
Run away from it all  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Here we are  
Face to face  
One more time  
  
In the light  
In the dark  
We will shine  
  
There's nobody, we're alone-lone-lone  
Take all of your worries, let them go, let them go  
I'll bring you to a place that only we know tonight  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
here we are  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Oh, we go higher baby  
Oh, we go higher baby

Out Of The Blue
Roxy Music
----------------
All you cares  
Now they seem  
Oh so far away  
All your fears  
I fear I once shared  
Now I know  
  
There's a future  
For all of us  
Not so long ago  
I was so scared  
You seemed so sad  
I could see  
  
Through your twisted smile  
So unsure  
Always confused  
Pale blue eyes  
Gazing down  
From your ivory tower  
Through the haze  
  
All broken and bruised  
Then: out of the blue  
Love came rushing in  
Out of the sky  
Came the sun  
Out of left field  
Came a lucky day  
Out of the blue  
No more pain  
I don't mind  
If it's only  
A passing craze  
Throwaway lines  
Often ring true  
If I were you  
  
I would stay  
For a little while  
I you were me  
Would you walk out  
In style?

Black Rose
Thin Lizzy
----------------
Tell me the legends of long ago  
When the kings and queens would dance in the realm of the Black Rose  
Play me the melodies I want to know  
So I can teach my children, oh  
  
Pray tell me the story of young Cuchulainn  
How his eyes were dark his expression sullen  
And how he'd fight and always won  
And how they cried when he was fallen  
  
Oh tell me the story of the Queen of this land  
And how her sons died at her own hand  
And how fools obey commands  
Oh tell me the legends of long ago  
  
Where the mountains of Mourne come down to the sea  
Will she no come back to me  
Will she no come back to me  
Oh Shenandoah I hear you calling  
  
Far away you rolling river  
Roll down the mountain side  
On down on down go lassie go  
Oh Tell me the legends of long ago  
  
When the kings and queens would dance in the realms of the Black Rose  
Play me the melodies so I might know  
So I can tell my children, oh  
My Roisin Dubh is my one and only true love  
  
It was a joy that Joyce brought to me  
While William Butler waits  
And Oscar, he's going Wilde  
Ah sure, Brendan where have you Behan?  
  
Looking for a girl with green eyes  
My dark Rosaleen is my only colleen  
That Georgie knows Best  
But Van is the man  
  
Starvation once again  
Drinking whiskey in the jar-o  
Synge's Playboy of the Western World  
As Shaw, Sean I was born and reared there  
  
Where the Mountains of Mourne come down to the sea  
Is such a long, long way from Tipperary

Accidentally In Love - Counting Crows
Soundtracks
----------------
So she said, "What's the problem, baby?"  
What's the problem I don't know  
Well, maybe I'm in love (love)  
Think about it everytime  
I think about it  
Can't stop thinkin about it  
  
How much longer will it take to cure this?  
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)  
Makes me wanna turn around and face me  
But I don't know nothing about love  
  
Come on, come on  
Turn a little faster  
Come on, come on  
The world will follow after  
Come on, come on  
Because everybody's after love  
  
So I said I'm a snowball running  
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  
Melting under blue skies  
Belting out sunlight  
Shimmering love  
  
Well baby I surrender  
To the strawberry ice cream  
Never ever end of all this love  
Well I didn't mean to do it  
But there's no escaping your love  
  
These lines of lightning  
Mean we're never alone,  
Never alone, no, no  
  
Come on, Come on  
Move a little closer  
Come on, Come on  
I want to hear you whisper  
Come on, Come on  
Settle down inside my love  
Come on, come on  
Jump a little higher  
Come on, come on  
If you feel a little lighter  
Come on, come on  
We were once  
Upon a time in love  
We're accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love (x7)  
Accidentally  
I'm In Love, I'm in Love,  
I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  
I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  
Accidentally (X 2)  
Come on, come on  
Spin a little tighter  
Come on, come on  
And the world's a little brighter  
Come on, come on  
Just get yourself inside her  
Love... I'm in love

Ten Storey Love Song
Stone Roses
----------------
When your heart is black and broken  
And you need a helping hand  
When you're so much in love  
You don't know just how much you can stand  
  
When your questions go unanswered  
And the silence is killing you  
Take my hand baby I'm your man  
I got love maybe enough for two  
  
Ten story love song  
I built this thing for you  
Who can take you higher  
Than twin deep mountain blue  
Oh well I've built this thing for you  
And I love you true  
  
There's no sure-fire set solutions  
No short-cut through the trees  
No breach in no wall that  
They put there to keep you from me  
  
As you're lying awake in this darkness  
This everlasting night  
Some day soon don't know where or when  
You're gonna wake up and see the light  
  
Ten story love song  
I built this thing for you  
Who can take you higher  
Than twin deep mountain blue  
Oh well I've built this thing for you  
And I love you true  
  
Ten story love song  
I built this thing for you  
Who can take you higher  
Than twin deep mountain blue  
Oh well I've built this thing for you  
And I love you true

Stay
Michael Bolton
----------------
As I search this heart of mine  
For words to tell you  
If you give me time I swear  
I'll find a way  
How I've come to feel about you  
I couldn't think of life without you  
These words could never say  
  
Like a fool I let my pride mislead me  
In this world I call myself a man  
But without your love to guide me  
Who could ease the pain inside me  
Somethin' only you could understand  
  
  
CHORUS  
Stay, please stay  
Oh stay, please stay  
'Cause I need you by my side  
On this long and lonely ride  
And there's so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
  
  
So I search this heart of mine  
For words to tell you  
If you give me time I swear  
I'll find a way  
How I've come to feel about you  
I couldn't think of life without you  
What I'm feeling now  
These words could never say  
  
  
CHORUS  
Stay, please stay  
Oh stay, please stay  
Oh, I need you by my side  
On this long and lonely ride  
And there's so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
There is so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
I've got so much love to give you  
If you'd stay  
  
  
Please stay

Cornucopia
Black Sabbath
----------------
Too much near the truth they say  
Keep it 'til another day  
Let them have their little game  
Delusion helps to keep them sane  
  
Let them have their little toys  
Matchbox cars and more kids joys  
Exciting in their plastic ways  
Frozen food in a concrete place  
  
Your gonna go insane  
I'm tryin' to save your brain  
  
Alright!  
  
I don't know what's happening  
My head's all torn inside  
People say I'm heavy  
They don't know what I hide  
  
Take a life it's going cheap  
Kill someone no one will weep  
Freedom's yours just pay your dues  
We just want your soul to use  
  
Your gonna go insane  
I'm tryin' to save your brain

The Fighter
Kris Kristofferson
----------------
I seen an old fighter, tired and in trouble  
Who just couldn't take anymore  
Somethin' inside him kept fighting to finish  
With only his feet on the floor-yeah  
  
Lord, I know that it's worth any price you could pay  
To see truth in whatever disguise  
But I'd payed double for one look of pleasure  
A piece of relief in his eyes.  
  
Ain't that clown, laughin' like crazy  
Ain't his eyes empty and deep  
Don't he sound sad as a baby  
When she cries out in her sleep  
  
We measured the space between Waylon and Willie  
And Willie and Waylon and me  
But there wasn't nothin' like Billy Jo Shaver  
What Billy Jo Shaver should be-no  
  
When he showed up sick later all bit by a spider  
And crazy to look in the eye  
He put on a show that was sad as it should of been  
And nobody even knew why  
  
Ain't that clown laughin' like crazy  
Ain't his eyes empty and deep  
Don't he sound sad as a baby  
When she cries out in her sleep

Don't Fence Me In
Frank Sinatra
----------------
Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above, don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love, don't fence me in.  
Oh let me be by myself in the evening breeze,  
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,  
Send me off forever but I ask you please, don't fence me in.  
  
Just turn me loose and I'll straddle on my saddle underneath the western
skies.  
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise.  
Oh let me ride to the ridge where the west commences,  
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses,  
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences, don't fence me in.

Foot Ball
Iggy Pop
----------------
I'm a football baby,  
  
Rollin' round the field.  
I've been passed and fumbled,  
Till I don't know what I feel.  
Everybody's the same,  
They're all footballs too.  
Setting up the big play  
  
And trying to score.  
  
I'm a football baby  
In a football game  
  
Run--kick  
I'm a football baby  
  
  
Life's a football game,  
As every chump and champ knows.  
  
We don't touch, we collide,  
Till we're worn out inside.  
We're kicking each other,  
Right where it hurts,  
Setting up the big play,  
And trying to score.  
  
I'm a football baby,  
  
In a football game  
I'm a football baby,  
I'm a football baby,  
In a football game  
I'm a football baby,  
  
Block--pass  
I'm a football baby,  
  
In a football game  
I'm a football baby,  
Run---kick---hit---goal .

Come to me, baby mine  
And I'll make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew

The days they seemed like years  
Right by your side I'm gonna stay  
Kiss away your tears

I won't hardly shake you  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
And I'll make sweet love to you  
Hold me tight, don't let go  
We'll dream the whole day through  
I missed you more than you could know  
I love only you

Yeah, we're comin' back then with another bombtrack  
Think ya know what it's all about  
Huh!  
Hey yo, so check this out  
Yeah!  
Know your enemy!  
Come on!  
  
Born with insight and a raised fist  
A witness to the slit wrist, that's with  
As we move into '92  
Still in a room without a view  
Ya got to know  
Ya got to know  
That when I say go, go, go  
Amp up and amplify  
Defy  
I'm a brother with a furious mind  
Action must be taken  
We don't need the key  
We'll break in  
  
Something must be done  
About vengeance, a badge and a gun  
Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system  
I was born to rage against 'em  
  
Fist in ya face, in the place  
And I'll drop the style clearly  
Know your enemy...Know your enemy!  
Yeah!  
  
Hey yo, and dick with this uggh!  
Word is born  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Now I got no patience  
So sick of complacence  
With the D the E the F the I the A the N the C the E  
Mind of a revolutionary  
So clear the lane  
The finger to the land of the chains  
What? The land of the free?  
Whoever told you that is your enemy?  
  
Now something must be done  
About vengeance, a badge and a gun  
Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system  
I was born to rage against 'em  
  
Now action must be taken  
We don't need the key  
We'll break in  
  
I've got no patience now  
So sick of complacence now  
I've got no patience now  
So sick of complacence now  
Sick of sick of sick of sick of you  
Time has come to pay  
Know your enemy!  
  
Come on!  
Yes I know my enemies  
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me  
Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission  
Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite  
All of which are American dreams

And I won't leave until I'm done  
So that's why you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don' t know why we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We haven't changed and rearranged  
And turn this planet back to one  
So tell me why we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
we've got to love and rub-a-dub  
We've got to dance and fall in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know got to know

You Were Meant For Me
Regine Velasquez
----------------
Oooh ooh oo....  
I have loved you for so long  
Can't imagine myself with another  
You're so much a part of me  
You're inside me  
I wanna be good enough for you  
In everything I do  
Don't you ever set me free  
I'd rather be locked up in your arms can't you see  
There's no place I would rather be  
I'll go wherever your love takes me  
Refrain:  
('Cause) You were meant for me  
As I was meant for you  
You were meant for me  
Together we will always be  
('Cause) You were meant for me  
You were meant for me  
My love gets stronger day by day  
Strong enough to stand the test of time  
And even when times are rough  
We were tough enough  
There's nothing I can do  
With you I'll see life through  
No one else can make me feel  
So good with your love so real  
Nothing else can ever replace  
Your kisses and your warm embrace  
(Repeat Refrain)  
Bridge:  
I love you so much, baby  
You just drive me crazy  
I'm hooked on your lovin' touch  
With you this life worth living  
For you I'll keep on trying  
I'll never, ever let you down  
Instrumental  
I'll keep holding on  
Instrumental  
(Repeat Refrain, ad lib, fade out)

Banks Of The Roses
Nick Cave
----------------
A traditional song which was a likely inspiration for Where The Wild Roses
Grow. Nick's song is also available.  
  
When I was a wee thing, I heard my mother say  
That I was meant for rambling and would easy go astray  
And before that I would work, I would rather sport and play  
With my Johnny on the banks of red roses  
  
  
On the banks of red roses, my love and I sat down  
He took out his tuning box to play his love a tune  
In the middle of the tune, his love got up and cried  
Oh Johnny, lovely Johnny, would you leave me?  
  
  
So they walked and they talked until they came upon a cave  
Where the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave  
Aye, the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave  
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of red roses  
  
  
Oh no, oh no, cried she, that grave's not meant for me  
Yes, oh yes, my darling, that your bridal bed shall be  
Yes, oh yes, my darling, that your bridal bed shall be  
And he's made her to lie down on red roses  
  
  
And all on his way homeward, his heart was filled with fear  
Every maid he came upon, he thought it was his dear  
Yes, every maid he came upon, he thought it was his dear  
Who he made to lie down on red roses

A Painter Passing Through
Gordon Lightfoot
----------------
Once upon a time I was on my own  
Once upon a time like you've never known  
Once upon a time I would be impressed  
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright  
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night  
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great  
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
I was in my stride, always at my game  
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame  
I was in demand, always in control  
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold  
Once upon a time, I was in a daze  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Now that I am old, let me rest a spell  
All that I am told, I can never tell  
Never in my life, never will it pass  
I am still alone, remembering at last  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history

Strange Times
Moody Blues
----------------
Long time ago  
Back in the mist of time  
Back when the crystal waters flowed  
There was a world  
So strange and so beautiful  
All life would flourish and would grow  
Years went by, time just fell away  
Love was worshiped like the sun  
But as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
What do we need?  
What do we hunger for?  
Who holds the secrets, who will know?  
Temples of greed  
In ruins on the river bed  
Wastelands that lived before the snow  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
It's you and I forever  
We won't be afraid  
Even if the stars are falling down  
Down, down, down, down  
Falling down  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times

River Lullaby
Ofra Haza
----------------
Hush now my baby  
Be still and don't cry,  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream  
Sleep and remember, my lullaby  
And I'll be with you when you dream  
  
Drift on a river  
That flows through my arms  
Drift as I'm singing to you,  
I see you smiling, so peaceful and calm  
Holding you I'm smiling too  
  
Here in my arms  
Safe from all harm  
Holding you I'm smiling too  
  
Hush now my baby  
Be still and don't cry,  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream  
Sleep and remember, my lullaby  
And I'll be with you when you dream  
  
Here in my arms  
Safe from all harm  
Holding you I'm smiling too  
  
Sleep and remember, this river lullaby  
I'll be with you when you dream  
(2x)  
  
I'll be with you when you dream

Every Little Thing
The Beatles
----------------
When I'm walking beside her  
People tell me I'm lucky.  
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy.  
I remember the first time  
I was lonely without her.  
Can't stop thinking about her now.  
  
Every little thing she does,  
She does for me, yeah.  
And you know the things she does,  
She does for me, oooh.  
When I'm with her I'm happy  
Just to know that she loves me.  
Yes, I know that she loves me now.  
  
There is one thing I'm sure of,  
I will love her forever.  
For I know love will never die.  
  
Every little thing she does,  
She does for me, yeah.  
And you know the things she does,  
She does for me, ooh.

Fabolous

Yeah, Uh, Ride, Ride, Ride, Uh.

If you ain't up on things  
Fabolous is the name, street fam is the game  
Screamin' 718 while them hammers bang  
Like bludda ludda lacca bludda ludda lacca  
Kick game like I know a little bit of socca  
Spic, dames, ass and a little bit of knockas  
Give them nick names and a little bit of vodka  
Then I'm game change, (A very freaky girl)  
You know who got the gold like the kid from "The Last Dragon"  
You know who got the low on the spokes and the ass saggin'  
You know who got the gold that'll have your ass gaggin'  
You know who got the boat that'll have the task naggin'  
But I fuck bitches, and get money  
My truck switches like,  
You got to duck bitches when you get twenties  
And plug switches that make you sit funny  
I'm a rider..  
  
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg (Fabolous)]  
If you ain't up on things  
(Don't come close to me  
Unless you ride like you supposed to be)  
If you ain't up on things  
(Don't come close to me  
Unless you pimpin' like you supposed to be)  
If you ain't up on things  
(Don't come close to me  
Unless you banging like you supposed to be)

Unless you gangsta like you supposed to be)

If I freeze up its kilos now  
Pick trees up its 3-4 pounds  
Fill the bees up 'til these bro's drown  
I snatch a few g's up and flea those towns  
Busta's freeze up when my "v" slow down  
I ease up with these 4 pounds  
Squeeze up to 3-4 rounds  
I pick these up its G code now  
Ya'll better call the D's up before I reload now  
I'm "The Boss" something like Springsteen  
I got something that bring green  
That look something like string beans  
I make sure the hustlers keep something to sling the fiends  
White, yellow, and a little something that bling green  
We going to blast if we going I been doing  
this since Jabbar was hooking off the glass in the forum (ghetto)  
Your grandparents has to assume  
Cause the face look like a magnifying glass on the poem (oh boy)

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]  
So my niggas (niggas)

It's the kid with the D. O. double G.  
After blowing 3-4 dubs of trees  
My eyes are below double g's  
After sipping pin-o bubbly skee-o rubbing me  
We'll probably go below publicly  
I'm a coast to coast G I keep the toast to mostly  
For those who pose to closely (backup)  
Keep a piece in the vest that's how we ride  
From the north to the south to the east to the west

Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky
Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
I cry, I cry  
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand  
God damn what I am  
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face  
My race has been disgraced  
  
Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky  
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky  
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky  
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky Johnny,  
Johnny, Johnny  
Puts us in a pumpkin shell where you keep us very well  
It's hell, where I dwell  
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist  
I'm pissed at this  
What this country claims to be  
It's a lie  
No place for me  
I bleed  
Kill my trust if you must  
But in my blood there is lust  
For life  
That's right  
Apache blood is in my heart thrashing though me like a shark  
Crashing though the dark  
What am I supposed to do  
I feel like I'm cut into confused  
By rules  
Do these cultures clash or am I living in the past  
I ask please tell me fast  
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong  
I took my foot kicked a hole in the sky  
I proceeded to plead fathers help me decide  
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye  
I turned around and found that I was still alive  
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky  
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides  
Then it dawned on my like the mornin' sun  
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes  
Glowing embers tend to remember when  
The power that is peace was treated as a friend  
I am a master of and I've got to take action  
I'm a man, the animal man

A Message 2 Fat Cuzz
Snoop Dogg
----------------
Ya oh  
I was juz told  
You get your freedom  
By telling you're enemy  
That  
You'll do anything to get you're freedom  
Then you'll get it  
Its the only way you'll get it  
When you get that kinda attitude  
Then they label you as a crazy negro  
Or they'll just call you a crazy nigga  
They dun say negro  
Or they'll call you an extremest or a subversive  
Or a sedetiast  
Or a red or a radical  
But when you stay radical long enough  
And get enough people to like you  
You'll get your freedom  
So dun run around here trying  
To to make friends with someone who will deprive you of you're rights  
There not you're friends  
No, there you're enemy's  
And treat them like that  
And fight them  
And you'll get you're freedom  
And after you get you're freedom you're enemy will respect you  
And well respect you  
And I say that with no hate  
Cause I dun have no hate in me  
I have no hate at all  
So I say to you  
Big man I'm the man you think you are  
If you want to no what ill do  
Figure out what you'll do and ill do the same only more of it

Winter Wonderland
Michael Buble
----------------
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, Are you married?  
We'll say, No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland

Deez Hollywood Nights
Snoop Dogg
----------------
[Chorus: x2]  
Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Huh, it's like that that there  
They love it when I let down my hair  
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson  
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel  
So I let 'em all come to my back table  
Roll up and lick the paper if they able  
Bottles of everything, models and everything  
Everything goes and yes I mean everything  
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'  
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'  
So, I invite her over to my party  
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie  
No autographs, I ain't signin' now  
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down  
My life is like one big highlight  
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion  
With some whites, some asians and persians  
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'  
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains  
She say she wanna be an actress  
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled action!  
Take one, take two, now cut  
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck  
Huh, yeah, here we go again  
I gotta go behind the club just to get in  
They say I'm just too much commotion  
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open  
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub  
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, "One Love"  
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass  
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room  
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues  
I just stepped in for a quick cameo  
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio  
He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe  
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go  
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight  
Yes, these Hollywood nights  
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out  
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out  
Cameras flashin', police passin'  
Every little model wanna give me some action  
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it  
Get some menage, durin' every visit  
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me  
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Sunshine
Uriah Heep
----------------
For many years I felt like a man  
Feeling his way through darkness  
This priceless treasure  
For which Ive searched  
  
Appeared to me nothing more  
Than a mirage in the sea  
But when the vision faded  
From this struggle and dream  
Suddenly my illusion is diary  
I've now discovered what is reality  
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine  
Ive found you  
  
Even if you're only  
Even if you're only  
Even if you're only  
Destined for a while  
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine  
  
Ive found you  
Even if you're only  
Destined for a while  
I'll be both most impressions  
  
And I arrive this with a smile  
As the picture book shows Stanley  
Standing at the source of the Nile

Shaking that thing for everybody to see  
Oh, everyone's thinking just like me  
Wonder who the lucky fool's going to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Get it while the gettin's good baby  
Take it cause the others would  
Ain't no hesitating, they just might be waiting  
Get it while the gettin's good  
  
Look at that dude in the parking lot  
Taken it for granted, everything he's got  
So if he hands you a dollar  
Say, Thank you sir, cause I've been up and down  
And I know what it's worth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I gotta have it, ain't no doubt about it  
Get it while the gettin's good  
  
You can say you don't want it  
But deep inside you know, you really do  
You know what I'm talking about  
Well everybody's thinking just like me  
Wonder who the lucky fool's going to be  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You gotta get it while the gettin's good baby  
You gotta get it while the gettin's good  
Oh you better get it while the gettin's good baby

Oh, I was moved by your screen dream  
Celluloid pictures living  
Your death could not kill my love for you  
Take two people romantic  
Smoky nightclub situation  
Your cigarette traces a ladder  
Here's looking at you kid  
Celebrate years  
Here's looking at you kid  
Wipe away tears  
Long time since we're together  
Now I hope it's forever  
Ideal love flies away now  
White jacket black tie wings too  
You gave her away to the hero  
Words don't express my meaning  
Notes could not spell out the score  
But finding not keeping's the lesson  
Here's looking at you kid  
Hard to forget  
Here's looking at you kid  
At least not yet  
Your memory stays  
It lingers ever  
Will fade away never

B is for blossom  
  
C is for cantelope  
  
D is for dog-gone awesome  
  
E is extremely blessed and endowed  
  
F is for fabulous  
  
That's what this song's all about  
  
Big top women sure do bounce around  
  
I love to see them walkin' up and down  
  
The steps of the courthouse make you go downtown  
  
I had to get some new tags  
  
My plates had done run out  
  
I had to get some new tags  
  
My plates had done run out  
  
And the tax assesor certainly left no doubt  
  
That the big top women sure do bounce around  
  
I love to see them walkin' up and down  
  
Ba-Ba-Boom Ba-Ba-Boom Ba-Ba-Boom  
  
Make you go down town  
  
I met this meter maid, Nadine  
  
She didn't carry no gun around  
  
But she was packin' some 38's  
  
Big tittie man get right down on the ground  
  
Now the big top women sure do bounce around  
  
I love to see them walkin' up and down  
  
Steps of the courthouse  
  
Make you wanna get a ticket and  
  
Go downtown  
  
I went downtown after work  
  
This joint called the hot house  
  
They had some big top women there  
  
And whoo, they then came out  
  
I said girl you sure look fine  
  
With your uniform gone  
  
She had hundred dollar bills  
  
Stuck in her thong  
  
Yea, big top women sure got it goin' on

Echo
Cyndi Lauper

Woke up to the clock  
What knob makes it stop  
Time to be aware  
Time to just be there  
You go, go , go, go,  
I go, go , go, go,  
Conversations rare  
Trail off in the air  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
All that rolls our way  
Wheels that time will play  
Happiness grows back  
Heartache leaves a scratch  
You go, go, go,go,  
I go, go, go , go  
Everyplace I go  
Never told you so  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
[Chorus]  
All of my days, all of my life  
Standing by you  
All of my days, all of my life  
I will find you  
All of my days, all of my life  
Standing by you  
All of my days all of my life  
Landing next to you  
  
When you're on the top  
Notice what you've got  
I will be your frail  
When your on the trail  
You go, go, go, go  
I go, go, go, go  
Everything you know  
Everywhere you go  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I go back back back  
You go from the top  
Once till we drop  
Never like to stop

Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, you know, I need someone  
Help  
  
(When)  
When I was younger, so much younger than today (I never needed)  
I never needed anybody's help in any way (now)  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured (and now I find)  
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you, please, please help me?  
  
(Now)  
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways (my independence)  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze (but)  
But every now and then I feel so insecure (I know that I)  
I know that I just need you like I've never done before  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you, please, please help me?  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in any way (now)  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured (and now I find)  
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you, please, please help me?  
Help me, help me

Smile
Michael Jackson
----------------
Smile, though your heart is aching  
Smile, even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky  
You'll get by  
  
If you smile  
With your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear may be ever so near  
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just  
  
Smile, though your heart is aching  
Smile, even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky  
You'll get by  
  
If you smile  
Through your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just smile  
  
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just smile

Lady - Oh
Neil Diamond
----------------
Lady-oh, lady-oh, I walked the streets again last night.  
I saw you in the city light like a vision, lady-oh.  
Lady I, lady I, I've been waitin' around such a long long time  
Believin' I could make you mine, just wanting you lady-oh.  
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.  
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.  
Oh, lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before?  
City lights, city lights burn so warm and they burn so bright,  
But me, I walk the city night to forget you, lady-oh.  
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.  
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.  
Oh, lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before

On The Mend
Foo Fighters
----------------
One more day that I've survived  
Another night alone  
Pay no mind I'm doing fine  
I'm breathing on my own  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
Wake me when the hour arrives  
Wake me with my name  
See you somewhere down the line  
We're tethered once again  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
Was it you?  
Sat alone  
Here we go  
  
Close and stay a while  
To take me where you go  
Single file we walk the mile  
Who's wandering back home  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
Was it you?  
Sat alone  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go

Mr. Cellophane (Chicago Soundtrack)
Billy Joel
----------------
If someone stood up in a crowd  
And raised his voice up way out loud  
And waved his arm  
And shook his leg  
You'd notice him  
  
If someone in a movie show  
Yelled "fire in the second row,  
This whole place is a powder keg! "  
You'd notice him  
  
And even without clucking like a hen  
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,  
Unless, of course, that personage should  
Be  
Invisible, inconsequential me!  
  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there!  
  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there. ..  
  
Suppose you was a little cat  
Residin' in a person's flat  
Who fed you fish and scratched your  
Ears?  
You'd notice him  
  
Suppoose you was a woman wed  
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years  
You'd notice him  
  
A human being's made of more than air  
With all that bulk, you're bound to see  
Him there  
  
Unless that human bein' next to you  
Is unimpressive, undistinguished  
You know who. ..  
  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should I bend my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
Never even know I'm there

Strange Fruit
Sting
----------------
Southern trees bear Strange Fruits  
Blood on the leaves, blood at the roots  
Black (belly's) body's swinging in the southern reek  
Strange fruit hanging from the popular tree.  
  
Past star will sing from the gallon south  
Bulging eyes and a twisted mouth  
Send up magnolia, sweet and fresh  
And the sudden smell of burning flesh.  
  
Here is the fruit for the crows to pluck  
For (but) the rain to gather for the wind to suck  
For the sun to rot for the tree to drop  
Here is the strange and bitter crop.

Awol
Eurythmics
----------------
Kat was in the bedroom  
Playing hidehideho  
Lou was in the kitchen  
Kissing Michelangelo  
Ray was in a coffin  
Taking measurements  
With string  
Jean was cleaning  
Windows trying to  
Teach the world to sing  
The satellite was beaming  
In a cabaret show were  
Juliet was arguing with stupid romeo  
The dog was reading poetry by  
Poe and valerie  
And I was sat there thinking  
How happy we could be  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I don't know why  
We're off to see the wizard!  
A.W.O.L.  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now the sneaky fat magician  
He stole my handkerchief  
He blew his nose and gave  
Himself 20 years of grief  
And I was so dumbfounded  
When he asked me for a loan  
I told him to repeat it  
To my tiny dictaphone  
And all the lazy bastards  
That ever walked the earth  
Were trying to get hold of me  
From Tokyo to Perth  
But I was up the cundy  
Combing my goatee  
You thought I was surrounded  
But with one bound ... our hero was free  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I don't know why  
We're off to see the wizard!  
A.W.O.L.  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now all you gay lieutenants  
Who follow the yellow brick  
Be sure to take your happy pills  
Before you get seasick  
The journey is long-winded  
With many twists and snakes  
And I forgot to mention  
There were never any breaks

Don't Drop Out
Dolly Parton
----------------
Am I to face these lonely halls alone  
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home  
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more  
And you're the one I adore so baby  
Chorus:  
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
You're not prepared to do anything  
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well  
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out  
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try  
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry  
They say you're no good so baby do what you should  
And stay here by my side oh darlin'  
Repeat Chorus  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
Don't drop out of my life  
Baby, don't drop out  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)

Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Lessons Of Love
Lea Salonga
----------------
See the children play  
Listen to the things they say  
One-on-one to one another  
They're just having fun  
Finding out it can be done  
They don't separate by cover  
Ooh, young hearts  
Facing to feel it so naturally  
And the flower grows from the seed and  
  
Chorus:  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin' enough  
And we're bound to be learning  
The lessons of love  
Coz we're never too old and never too young  
To be teaching each other the lessons of love  
  
Got some work to do  
There's so much we can improve  
Piece by piece we come together, yeah  
In the neighborhood  
I know we can make it good  
But we've got to make it better  
  
Oh woh oh, inside each of us has a romelody  
But we've got to find our harmony  
  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin' rnough  
And we've got to remember  
The lessons of love  
Coz we're never too old and never too young  
To be teaching each other the lessons of love  
  
Bridge:  
Imagine how this world could be  
If all of us would live in peace  
Nothing good comes easily  
Together starts with you and me  
Yeah, oh yeah, aha  
Lessons of love  
  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin' enough  
And we're bound to be learning  
The lessons of love  
Coz we're never too old and never too young

To be teaching each other the lessons of love  
  
Practice makes perfect, try it enough

Bolivian Ragamuffin
Aerosmith
----------------
Pack up your troubles in your old gym bag  
You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin  
I'll take short breaks, love her to the outbreaks  
  
Standing on the seashore, lookin' at the city  
See the street light, dog bite, go lady on the TD8  
The wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves  
There's others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby  
  
Can't break, cabbage head  
Try and get a salad made  
Hold my pickle, hold the lettuce  
Session waters don't upset us  
  
Kick, stand, face look so evil, like Knieval  
Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner  
Like a squawk eight fool in I don't know orogotus  
If I have to do rock a roller up a jello  
  
Facial, connish lie  
Smoke a bowl of feeling fine  
Burn and people, try to let us  
Session waters won't upset us  
  
Hee lee cans (Kick in the pants)  
Water fall (got on a dance)  
Blame it all (Say gotta eve us a trance)  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it...

Sleeping Pill
Queen Adreena

Oh so, my love  
This sleeping pill  
Will watch you through the night  
And come dawn  
I'll be long, long gone  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
We feed upon the broken branch  
We kiss the stars goodbye  
For the sun can't fight this overcast  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
The spider's web  
It can't break our fall  
I whisper to the sky  
I pray she takes you in her arms  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
I.. Tried..  
Storm warning in the sand  
She evaporates beneath my fingernails  
The road is lost underwater  
She's running down a river with eels  
She is lost to me.

And Dream Of Sheep (Live) [Act Two]
Kate Bush

[Verse 1]  
Little light shining  
Little light will guide them to me  
My face is all lit up  
My face is all lit up  
  
[Chorus 1]  
If they find me racing white horses  
They'll not take me for a buoy  
Let me be weak, let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ooh, I'll wake up to any sound of engines  
Every gull a seeking craft  
I can't keep my eyes open  
Wish I had my radio  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I'd tune into some friendly voices  
Talking 'bout stupid things  
I can't be left to my imagination  
Let me be weak, let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
[Outro]  
Ooh, their breath is warm  
And they smell like sleep  
And they say they take me home  
Like poppies, heavy with seed  
They take me deeper and deeper

Loretta Lynn

It's too late but something tells me I was wrong  
For doing the one thing that I did  
Ah I'd prove I can I had let you have your way

When we made love it brought the meanings to my life  
You taught me a brand new way to live  
Ah now it's debtful if I'll ever be your wife  
And I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
I gave you the part of me that no one else had touched  
Because I loved you and you said you wanted me so much  
Now you've changed and it's because of what I did  
I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
You don't know the hurt you've put deep in the heart of me  
You've got what you wanted now you want no part of me  
Mhm now you've changed and it's because of what I did  
I gave everything that a girl in love should never give

I Ain't Been Licked
Diana Ross
----------------
Roll down the gangway  
So they'll see that it's me  
I know they'll wonder about my recovery  
Yes, I lost a love that promised happiness  
What my heart wouldn't accept  
Put me to the test  
They keep a holding me down  
But I rise, yes, it can be done  
They keep a holding me down  
But I rise, they can't make me run  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, got my second wind  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, tell 'em I'm back again  
Just say, I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
Tell 'em for me, I ain't been licked  
Like outta nowhere  
My whole world fell apart  
Till this day no one knows  
What I felt in my heart  
All those precious things  
Inside me tried to still  
Hands I thought would help  
Pushed me over the hill  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, yes, it can be done  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, they can't make me run  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, got my second wind  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, tell 'em I'm back again  
Just say, I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
Tell 'em for me, I ain't been licked  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise just to start again  
Rise, show 'em that I can  
Rise, found a brand new dream  
Rise just to prove one thing  
Just say, I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
Tell 'em for me, I ain't been licked  
I want the world to see  
I ain't been licked  
Although my love is gone  
I ain't been licked  
Somehow I carry one  
I ain't been licked  
I'll find the strength somehow  
I ain't been licked  
I think I'm ready now  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked

No More
Billie Holiday
----------------
You ain't gonna bother me no more  
No how  
Love just goes so far  
No more  
Woke up this morning and found  
I didn't care for you no more  
No how  
  
Never felt so good before  
You're down to my size  
It's over and done  
So honey, step down from your throne  
That look in your eyes  
Don't bother me none  
Can take or leave you alone  
From my window  
Sky's ain't gray no more  
Not now  
  
Here's the day  
That I've been waiting for  
Got only one heart  
One heart with no spares  
Must save it for loving  
Somebody who cares  
So you ain't gonna bother me  
No more, no more

Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe
Bette Midler
----------------
It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe.  
He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow.  
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh  
When they know little Joe's passing by.  
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare,  
But then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere.  
Troubles fly away and life is easy go.  
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know.  
Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe.  
  
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare,  
But then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere.  
Troubles fly away and life is easy go.  
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know.  
Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe.  
Little Joe, my little Joe, little Joe.

Ring around the rosie

Then comes marriage  
Then comes Adam  
In a baby carriage

Slow Drag
Fastball
----------------
Slow drag of a cigarette  
Slow drag and I'm lying in my bed  
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna lay you down in the ground alright  
Slow drag and I can't get up now  
Slow drag, you've been messing with my mind  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me no more  
You're nothing to me  
Nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me no more  
You're nothing to me  
Nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
  
Ain't nothing to me  
You're nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
No more, oh  
No more, no

Pearl In The Shell
Howard Jones
----------------
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing.  
Under his nose was a dream come true  
Been there all the time and he almost knew.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .  
Under his nose was a dream come true. ..  
Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well  
  
His duty was to use it - left his pearl in the shell.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .

Been Here All Along
Miley Cyrus
----------------
Mmm. Yeaah  
Sunrise and I lifted my head  
Then I smiled at your picture sittin' next to my bed  
Sunset and you're feelin' okay  
Cause you smile at the letter that I sent you today  
  
And I can't wait till I see you again  
And we'll both say remember when  
The band played on the 4th of July  
And you held me on your shoulders way up high  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
You've been here all along  
You've been here all along  
  
Back then you walked me to school  
Tell me to be careful and to follow the rules  
Fast forward, you taught me to drive  
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride  
  
And I can't wait till I see you again  
And we both say, remember when  
I'm holding on to moments like that  
And I know that they're coming back  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
You've been here all along.  
  
Yeahh  
  
All along, the way  
I keep you in my heart  
And in my breath  
You'll always be the one  
That cares the most  
Counting all the days  
I see you runnin' up to say  
I miss you  
I miss you  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
Cuz you're with me  
You've been here all along  
You've been here all along

Little Empty Boat
Nick Cave
----------------
You found me at some party,  
You thought I'd understand,  
You barreled over to me,  
With a drink in each hand.  
I respect your beliefs girl  
And I consider you a friend,  
But I've already been born once,  
I don't want to be born again.  
Your knowledge is impressive  
And your argument is good,  
But I am the resurrection babe  
And your standin' on my foot  
  
[Chorus]  
But my little boat is empty,  
It don't go  
And my oar is broken,  
It don't row row row,  
My little boat is empty,  
It don't go,  
And my oar is broken,  
It don't row row row  
  
Your tiny little face  
Keeps yappin' in the gloom  
Seven steps behind me  
With your dust-pan and broom.  
I can't help but imagine you  
All postured and prone,  
But there's a little guy on my shoulder  
Says I should go home alone  
But you keep leaning in on me  
And you're lookin' pretty pissed  
That grave you've dug between  
Your legs is hard to resist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give to God what belongs to God  
And give the rest to me,  
Tell our gracious host to fuck himself,  
It's time for us to leave  
  
[Chorus]

Forget To Remember
Megadeth
----------------
Sands in the hourglass fall for us all  
You don't answer me anymore when I call  
So much is trapped inside, tangled in your brain  
It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain  
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in  
  
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,  
You forget to remember  
  
If this is living, what the hell is living for?  
You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door  
I'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face  
You can't recall me at all,  
There's not a trace, not a trace, not a trace  
I don't know where you are and my world is crumbling in  
  
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,  
You forget to remember  
  
I just want to talk  
What do you want?  
But you've nothing to say  
Leave me alone  
I beg you to come  
Get away from me  
And you just walk away  
I have no idea who you are!  
I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray  
  
A burning candle in-between and at both ends  
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend  
I just wish you could say my name again  
  
They made the lock and broke the key,  
The culprit was the mercury  
The vaccine wipes your memories,  
Till you forget even how to breathe  
A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive  
  
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by  
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie  
  
You forget to remember it's time to say the long goodbye

Dying To Meet You
Judas Priest
----------------
Came in this morning high on a bird's wing  
Quite open minded but still quite aware  
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning  
Picking out landmarks that said I was there  
Led to positions by stern faced leaders  
Who never let one smile depart from their face  
  
Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started  
One or two crack up and start to cry  
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow  
Every few moments I see I friend die  
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight  
As into the battle we are all led  
  
Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay  
Maiming, destroying, every single day  
Is this the way that you get your fun  
Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun  
  
Get out, get out, go and do your job  
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob  
You make me sick, getting paid for murder  
You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no  
You never ever dream to hurt her  
  
Hero, hero, you have done so well  
So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell  
Take your medal, wear it now with pride  
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside

Wheels Of Life
Gino Vannelli
----------------
The wheels of life are turning so much faster  
The restless hands of time pass me by  
There are dreams I'll never live to see  
But as long as you believe in me  
I'll still feel them on the way  
As I take life day by day  
  
Oh the wheels of time are turning so much stronger  
The blues of days gone by weigh me down  
But maybe love will come to rescue me  
And I'll never set you free  
Like the sea runs to the shore  
I've come back yo you once more  
  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life keep turning round and round  
  
And if I should only have one tomorrow  
It's a lifetime if I knew  
I could spend that day with you  
  
Ooh, the wheels of love will turn my world forever  
I want you in my arms for all time  
And maybe love will come to rescue me  
And I'll never ever set you free  
Like the sea runs to the shore  
I'll love you forever more  
  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life keep turning round and round  
  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life keep turning so much faster  
The wheels of life are turning so much stronger

Gives You Hell
Glee
----------------
I wake up every evening  
With a big smile on my face  
And it never feels out of place.  
And you're still probably working  
At a 9 to 5 pace  
I wonder how bad that tastes  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
  
Now where's your picket fence love?  
And where's that shiny car?  
Did it ever get you far?  
You never seem so tense, love  
I never seen you fall so hard  
Do you know where you are?  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told I'm lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
Hope it gives you hell  
  
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself  
Yeah. Where did it all go wrong?  
But the list goes on and on  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told I'm lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
Now you'll never see  
What you've done to me  
You can take back your memories  
They're no good to me  
And here's all your lies  
You can look me in the eyes  
With the sad, sad look  
That you wear so well  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
(hope it gives you hell)  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
(hope it gives you hell)  
When you hear this song and you sing along well you'll never tell  
(you'll never tell)  
Then you're the fool I've just as well I hope it gives you hell  
(gives you hell)  
When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell  
(give you hell)  
You can sing along I hope that he will treat you well

Delia
Bob Dylan
----------------
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,  
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West,  
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned,  
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low,  
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,  
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,  
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"  
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"  
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup,  
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.

Ritual
Journey
----------------
Caught up in the daily grind  
Hard to find some peace of mind  
'Round here lately  
  
Trying to escape the beaten path  
To near the wrath of the world  
It just had me crazy  
Ooh crazy  
  
Just something to look forward to  
Along with you  
I still get lost in you baby  
It's always you, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all that comes together  
We're meant, two animals  
We've got something sacred  
You've become a ritual  
Our spirits feed each other  
We never get our fill  
Onward for your sweet religion  
You've become my ritual  
  
When I am with you all time stands still  
If I had the will then  
Pressure just doesn't phase me  
  
You more than take my breath way  
You captivate, we levitate  
You amaze me  
Ooh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My ritual  
I want you baby  
  
Celebrate the love we found  
Make my world go round  
In your arms where I belong  
Makes me love all night long  
All night long  
  
You're all I see  
Heaven's here with me  
Need this time alone  
Send my spirit free  
Free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My ritual

I Only Have Eyes For You
Carly Simon
----------------
My love must be a kind of blind love  
I can't see anyone but you  
Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
The moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
  
'Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue, you are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
  
And I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue, you are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
  
And I only have eyes, yes I only have eyes  
I only have eyes for you, only have eyes for you  
Only have eyes for you, only for you

Love the one youre with  
When youre down and confused  
And you don't remember who youre talking to  
Consentration gonna slip away

Mother Mary
Ufo
----------------
[Chorus 1]  
Try to make some changes really on the line  
Given your religion, never ever time  
All the jokers laughing, queens upon the floor  
Mothers understand it, baby needs some more  
  
Head held up to ransom, by a quick hand and a gun  
Just your education, hard to understand  
Will the teenage legend make a mark on you  
Make a big time status, with a pen we'll stab it through  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Mother Mary could you ever really feel the same  
And would you try to understand a wild colonial boy  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2]

Left Hand
Crowded House
----------------
It was typical of you  
To give it to me plain  
The sign on your door  
Said make your mind up or go away  
  
It was difficult for me  
To figure you out  
Left hand  
Always wants to know what the right is doing  
  
Tell the way we miss out on something  
We're free  
But there is nothing when I present  
It was typical of you  
  
To feather your nest  
Try to explain  
Me and my big mouth were laid to rest  
There's nowhere to go  
  
But I'm not hanging around  
Left hand  
Pick me up and then you put me down  
Left hand  
  
Always wants to know what the right is doing  
Tell the way we miss out on something  
We're free  
But there is one thing when I present  
  
Left hand  
Left hand  
Left hand

Only You Know
Veruca Salt
----------------
Don't thank me for what you got  
I've given you love I've given you too much thought  
Don't blame me for sinking the ship  
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Don't thank me for what you got  
I've given you love I've given you too much thought  
Don't shame me for calling it quits  
You're a hopeless sinner and an optimist  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Hey, don't hate me for what you got  
I've given you drugs I've given you too much fun  
Don't blame me for flunking the test  
I would rather think that you were honest  
Don't blame me cause you got caught  
You've given me up, you've taken everything I got  
Those lies came straight from your mouth  
I never dreamed that you would be a sellout  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Don't use me as your last crutch  
I've taken you in, I've trusted you way too much  
Don't wear me around your wrist  
You should've thought it through before you blew it  
Same day, same life, different person  
Your ghost, my pride, perfect  
Don't hate me for what you got  
I've given you love, I've given you too much thought.  
Don't shame me for sinking the ship  
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite  
Don't hate me for what you're not  
I'm aiming your gun  
I'm lining up the perfect shot  
Don't waste me  
On something stupid like this  
  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know

I Am
Train
----------------
I never been on a railroad, as many times as they pass me by  
I never crashed in the desert or seen a rodeo  
I don't know much about the world wars or Vietnam  
I've yet to read about Uncle Tom  
Never climbed a real rock or seen Colorado  
Am I the son I think I am  
Am I the friend I think I am  
Am I the man I think I wanna be hey  
I never had a day where money didn't get in my way  
I never listened to much Elvis  
I can't remember a warm December  
Am I the son I think I am  
Am I the friend I think I am  
Am I the man I think I wanna be hey  
'Cause I'm here for my sanity sanity  
I am here for you  
I'm here for your fantasy sanity, I am here  
I am  
Am I the son I think I am  
Am I the friend I think I am  
Am I the man I think I wanna be  
'Cause I'm here for my sanity sanity I am here for you  
Whether or not I'm walkin' in  
Whether or not I'm walkin' out  
I'm always here for you

Pass Me By
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
Pass Me By  
"Does this excite you? Think about it! Does it not stagger the  
imagination? No builder on earth can concieve any structure to  
compare to the mansions above. Won't that be something when you go  
to live in your own mansion? There'll be no concern about paying for it,  
it's already taken care of. There'll be no worry about veing moved out  
of it. It will be yours forever."  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I got shot, ah!, the murder was heinous  
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus  
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot  
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot  
And I'm sittin in a '64 Reinkeys  
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys  
I look around I can't believe that it's possible  
I'm dead, and I made it to the carnival  
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of  
Everybody and they momma got clown luv  
Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese,  
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto g's. (woowoo)  
Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers  
Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers  
I see my old homey, he died in a drag  
Chillin with two bitches, "What up, Shaggs?"  
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk  
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it  
And to think, I always been afraid to die  
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why.  
[Chorus (2x)]  
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry  
Even though most never try  
I'm not gonna let this pass me bye, no  
[Violent J]  
I was born, first, they threw me in a shit pile  
I dealt with it, and lived there for a while  
I got dissed on, pissed on, and beat down  
Mutilated, and tossed out a dead clown  
Next thing ya know, I'm chillin' at the big top  
Free money, and mad bitches non-stop  
No water, it's Faygo on tap  
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack with it  
'cause I can, 'cause I'm phat paid  
I got a five story funhouse with a maid  
And she walks around with her titties hanging out  
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off (woowoo)  
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see  
Jimi Hendrix, Selena, and Eazy E  
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off  
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt  
There's no fights, it's a perfect match  
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin' to cabbage patch  
And to think, I've always been afraid to die  
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why.  
[Chorus (2x)]  
[Violent J]  
Did ya ever burn your finger on somethin? hey  
Well picture this, your nuts burnin that way  
And a roman candle stickin' in your butthole  
That's where the greedy skank motherfuckers go  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
This is all hell now, we livin' in it  
But this bullshit'll be over in a minute  
Then it's off to the Faygos and neden hoes  
New clothes, and patent leather for your toes (woo-woo)  
[Violent J]  
And while you sit around cryin' for your dead friend  
He's chillin' up there, paid, getting mad ends  
He's probably there tryin to figure out why you're sad  
He's on the beach gettin' fat, you got it bad  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
And for those who ain't down for the next man  
Who rob from the poor, and snatch all ya can  
And any chicken talkin' shit, lemme tell ya something  
Hold a lighter to your balls, and you'll see what's coming  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"Does this excite you? Think about it! Does it not stagger the  
imagination? No builder on earth can concieve any structure to compare  
to the mansions above. Won't that be something when you go to live  
in your own mansion? There'll be no concern about paying for it,  
it's already taken care of. There'll be no worry about veing moved out  
of it. It will be yours forever."  
[Chorus (10x)]

Human Touch, The
Nina Simone
----------------
No one seems to care as much  
No time to smile, laugh or cry as much  
Have we lost the touch that means so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
  
No one wants to be alone  
To walk or talk and sleep and weep alone  
Have we lost the touch that does so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
  
Touch me now and let me know  
Hold me tight so i can go  
Through this misery unafraid  
And really knowin' what lift is all about  
  
No one wants to live alone  
Who wants to smile, laugh or cry alone  
Have we lost the touch that means so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
Yes, yes, yes

More Than This
Norah Jones
----------------
I could feel at the time  
There was no way of knowing  
Fallen leaves in the night  
Who can say where they're blowing  
As free as the wind  
And hopefully learning  
Why the sea on the tide  
Has no way of turning  
  
[Chorus]  
More than this  
There is nothing  
Oh more than this  
You tell me one thing  
More than this  
You know there's nothing  
  
It was fine for a while  
There was no way of knowing  
Like a dream in the night  
Who can say where we're going  
No cares in the world  
And baby I'm learning  
Why the sea on the tide  
It has no way of turning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More than this  
You know there is nothing  
Much more than this  
You tell me one thing  
More than this  
There is nothing  
More than this

Shades Of Gray
The Monkees
----------------
When the world and I were young,  
Just yesterday.  
Life was such a simple game,  
A child could play.  
It was easy then to tell right from wrong.  
Easy then to tell weak from strong.  
When a man should stand and fight,  
Or just go along.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
I remember when the answers seemed so clear  
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.  
It was easy then to tell truth from lies  
Selling out from compromise  
Who to love and who to hate,  
The foolish from the wise.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
It was easy then to know what was fair  
When to keep and when to share.  
How much to protect your heart  
And how much to care.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
Only shades of gray.

Be Here To Love Me
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine  
Though you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine  
That's got you to feeling this way, but I don't care,  
I want you to stay  
And hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
  
Children are dancin', the gamblers are chancin' their all  
The window's accusing the door of abusing the wall  
But who cares what the night watchmen say  
The stage has been set for the play  
Hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
  
The moon's come and gone but a few stars hang on on to the sky  
The wind's runnin' free but it ain't up to me ask why  
The poets are demanding their pay  
They've left me with nothin' to say  
'Cept hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today  
Just hold me and tell me that you'll be here to love me today

Stardust
Michael Buble
----------------
And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadows of my heart  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wandered down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that would not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
The lonely nights dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
And beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You were in my arms  
Nightingale tells it's fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses grew  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it always will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain  
  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
Oh, but that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You were in my arms  
The nightingale tell it's fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses grew  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

Paul McCartney

You made me cry when you said goodbye  
Ain't that a shame?  
My tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
  
Oh well, goodbye, although I'm crying

Fast Train
Kate Bush
----------------
Written by: myles goodwyn  
  
I read the colors this mornin'  
I read the colors today  
About a man who left from nowhere to be someone  
And every day he has to pay in every way  
  
I met a man from new york city  
He spoke of things I've yet to find  
A good man driven from his homeland  
Tryin' to find some piece of mind  
  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train

Do Right Woman, Do Right Man
Willie Nelson
----------------
Take her to heart  
And she'll always love you  
And nobody can make her do wrong  
But take her for granted  
Leavin' your love unshown  
Makes will power weak  
And temptation strong  
A woman's only human  
This you should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
And if you want  
A do right all day's woman  
You gotta be  
A do right all night's man  
  
A woman's only human  
This you should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
And if you want  
A do right all day's woman  
You gotta be  
A do right all night's man

Port Arthur High School Reunion
Janis Joplin
----------------
What do you think about your town since you've left and come back ?  
It's fantastic! I was across the river from the club last night, I never had
more fun in my life! except sometimes in california I have more fun.  
Do you plan to come back soon ?  
Oh ? er, er, er, I have no immediate plans, ha ha ha!!  
Did you entertain in high school, at the high school, when you went back at
the high school ?  
Only when I walked down the aisles, man. no, I did, no, I was, er, I was a
painter, and a sort of a recluse in high school. I've changed.  
What happened ?  
I got liberated! I don't know, I just started to sing and singing makes you
want to come out because painting, I feel, keeps you inside, you know ? and
once you start singing you just sort of wa  
O talk to people more and go out more and, you know, your lifestyle's becomes
more a come-out, flow-out thing instead of a hold-it-and-be-quiet type.  
How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager ?  
I don't know, why don't you ask them ?  
Did they make you different ?  
No.  
Otherwise were you different in comparison with them, or were you ?  
I felt apart from them.  
Did you take a part in football games ?  
I think not. I didn't go to the high school prom, and er ...  
Oh, you were asked, weren't you ?  
No, I wasn't. I don't think, I don't think they wanted to take me. till I'll
be a hundred and sufferin'! it's enough to make you wanna sing the blues!

White Christmas
Queensryche
----------------
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all  
Your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white  
Christmas with you  
Jingle Bells  
All the way, all the way

Lucky
Donna Summer
----------------
Scared and lonely  
Going out for the night  
Shakin' all over  
And wishing I'd never  
Come here  
  
He pulled up in a cloud of smoke  
So much was said  
But nobody spoke a word  
  
So I took a chance  
And he followed me home  
I knew he wouldn't beg  
So I gave in without fighting  
  
Been so long since I've been this way  
Since I loved this way  
So I asked him if he would stay for a while  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
We talked a while  
And he told me nice  
We laughed and we cried and  
I knew that I could love him  
He got up to say goodbye  
I said where you going,  
He said that he must leave  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
Lucky takes you out for a ride  
For a ride  
Lucky takes you out for a ride  
For a ride  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
  
Lucky come easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride

Don't Cry Daddy
Conway Twitty
----------------
Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing around my head  
My pillow still wet  
From last nights tears  
And as I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Keeps crying out  
And ringing in my ears.  
  
Don't cry daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me, Jimmy and Johnny  
Together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry.  
  
Why must children be the first  
To feel the pain and hurt the worst  
It's true somehow it don't seem right  
And ev'ry time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so  
I wonder will it be the same tonight?  
  
Don't cry daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me, Jimmy and Joni  
Together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy ride us on your back again.  
  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry  
Well daddy, please don't cry

The Best Of Love
Michael Bolton
----------------
I've got this somethin' to tell you  
There ain't no doubt in my mind  
All I'm askin' is to keep you near forever  
Just till the end of time  
  
Baby, I know where love grows  
My heart is overflowin'  
You're so fine and so true  
I want to spend my time, spendin' time with you, baby  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
You know you've got me by my deepest emotion  
'Cause you keep givin' me the best of love  
  
Passion and sweet inspiration  
So rare and so hard to find  
You are my journey and my destination  
Queen of this heart of mine  
  
Baby, I know where love grows  
In my life it's overflowin'  
You're so fine and it's so true  
I know I've got it all, all because of you, baby  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
You know ya reach into my deepest emotion  
And you keep givin' me, the best of love  
  
With every moment that passes by  
This love goes on  
It keeps growin' stronger  
And the more we're together  
The best keeps gettin' better, baby  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
You know you're down inside my deepest emotion  
So just keep givin' me, the best of love  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
Ain't nothin' finer than that sweetest emotion  
Just keep givin' me, just keep on givin' me  
The best of love, best of love, best of love

The Last Straw
Widespread Panic
----------------
Straw can bury us  
We can carry the hay  
But straws can break  
Like the reasons for my behavior  
  
Straws mend  
And straws bend  
And dry ones catch like  
A secret worth never paid for  
  
Strong muscles  
My strong muscles  
Plowman, come and dig my farm  
It's only making my body sneeze  
  
Straw  
  
Straw can bury us  
We can carry us  
But you better jump right now  
Cause these brakes left some sparks  
And now the wagon's caught fire  
  
Let's jump up on the camel's back  
Not one straw there gonna break his back  
Not one straw there gonna break his back  
Just the weight of five short men  
  
Let's jump up on the camel's back  
Not one straw there gonna break his back  
Not one straw there gonna break his back  
Just the weight of six young men

Electricity
Elton John
----------------
I can't really explain it  
I haven't got the words  
It's a feeling that you can't control  
I suppose its like forgetting,  
Losing who you are,  
And at the same time,  
Something makes you whole,  
Its like that there's a music,  
Playing in your ear,  
And I'm listening, and I'm listening  
And then I disappear  
  
And then I feel a change  
Like a fire deep inside  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
And suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
  
It's a bit like being angry,  
It's a bit like being scared,  
Confused and all mixed up,  
And mad as hell,  
It's like when you've been crying,  
And you're empty, and you're full,  
I don't know what it is,  
It's hard to tell,  
  
Its like that there's some music,  
Playing in your ear,  
But the music,  
Is impossible,  
Impossible to hear,  
  
But then I feel it move me,  
Like a burning deep inside,  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
Then suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
Oh oh whoa.  
I'm free.

Above All
Hillsong United
----------------
Above all powers, above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind a stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Above all powers, above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind a stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind a stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all

Rockin' Chair Money
Hank Williams
----------------
Rockin' chair money  
Now I got rockin' chair money  
But I got it the hard, hard way  
I fought in every battle  
From the start to the VJ day  
Now I'll rock, yeah, rock  
Oh baby rock, rock on down the line  
Now some folks seem to be jealous  
Some don't seem to care  
But I got rockin' chair money, honey  
To rock on away from here  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, rock on down the line  
I rocked away out on the ocean  
I rocked from here and there  
My baby stepped out while I was gone  
Now she don't get my rockin' chair  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, rock on down the line  
I'll soon get my big check, baby  
And then we'll have some fun  
This rockin' chair money, honey  
Is better than totin' a gun  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, let's rock on down the line  
Now honey, let's go honky-tonkin'  
Let's honky-tonk all night  
Let's lolly gag and smooch and love  
And do it all upright  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, let's rock on down the line

Old Time Rock N Roll
Chuck Berry
----------------
Just take those old records off the shelf  
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Don't try to take me to a disco  
You'll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Won't go to hear them play a tango  
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul  
There's only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll  
Call me a relic, call me what you will  
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Repeat Chorus x3  
  
I like the Old time Rock 'n' Rock

Changing Of The Tide
Hank Snow
----------------
On days like this we would linger by the ocean  
Then we would dream as we lay there side by side  
I don't know why but one day you got the notion  
To sit and watch for the changing of the tide  
And then he came just to ask a foolish question  
But jealousy in my heart I could not hide  
Though I don't believe it was really your intention  
In your eyes I saw the changing of the tide  
Now you're gone from me all you left to me is the restless sea to keep me
company  
Now I'm here alone where we used to be together  
I can't forget guess I never really try  
Fool that I am I'll go on and on forever just watching for the changing of the
tide

Don't Make Me Wait On Love
Michael Bolton
----------------
(duet with kenny G)  
Sittin' here, just starin' at your picture  
Waiting for your call  
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion  
We could have it all  
Time and time again, You tell me to be patient  
But we can't let love slip away  
  
Chorus:  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't make me wait for love  
  
I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness  
Fall asleep alone  
Give me a sign, a man's not suppose to face life  
Standing on his own  
When you're near me, I can't help but see forever  
Come and rescue me tonight  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't you see I need ya, gotta have ya  
Oh baby, don't make me wait for love this time  
Oh Oh darlin', a love like this is hard to find  
Don't make me wait for love  
  
Oh baby, don't make me wait  
Don't make me wait for love this time  
No No I need you right now, I need you right now  
Oh darlin', a love like this, a love like this  
Is so very hard to find, don't make me wait  
Don't make me wait for love

So you made it, this far,

You special, Marley, don't shoot  
You know what this is?  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Yeah, you still in the carter 2 people  
  
Hey yeah,  
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise  
A fist full of dollars, a list full of problems  
I'll address them like P.O. Boxes  
Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit  
We so out of it, zero tolerance  
Gangster gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it  
I'm wealthy, still fuckin' with that block shit  
Wet your ass up, head to feet till your sock a drip  
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass  
No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass  
I hear 'em but they talking under mass  
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass  
That's Cash Money, honey pie  
We ain't runnin', we don't hide screamin' fuck the other side  
Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind  
I'll put your heart on it and walk on it  
The chalks only for the art homie  
How they trace ya after I erase ya  
Look around, we at war and you still in preparation  
I'm riding for them reparations, no patience  
Slow paper is better than no paper  
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it  
You gotta know that paper  
If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper  
Gotta know that photo-fobia, no Kodak moments  
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em  
Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook  
I don't do too much posin', got a cool killer look  
Career crook, get your career took  
I'm back like a brassiere hook  
Bitch cheer, camouflage gear, the hunter's here  
Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer  
Around here and this here is The Carter  
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama  
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter  
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada  
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em  
On the head at the bottom  
You ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em  
And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em  
Get 'em

Insane Clown Posse

Um anybody else have another  
Halloween story they'de like to share with the class?  
I have another one. Well you have just told your story J  
So what bitch, you sit here every day and tell stories  
I'll tell a story in this mutha fucka  
See he doesn't want me to tell my story  
'cause he knows my story, it's about Mr. Rotten Treats  
All your parentes know my story too  
They don't tell you about him though  
Long ago they all killed Mr. Rotten Treats  
They're scared that you'll talk about 'em, they're scared that  
He'll come back from the dead, they're all scared  
he'll cut your fuckin' ass  
Welcome too, the other side  
that's what they told me when I died  
I was stabbed in the head  
Look what ya done dead  
All the blood bleed, one juggalo dead  
It was a cold, dark, scary Halloween  
So my neighbors and my people,  
they didn't really like me right?  
So they came and burn down my world  
Just because I like to murder their boys and girls  
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one  
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun  
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to  
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?  
I come back from the other side  
I come for the people that took away my life  
Trick or treat bitch, my dead body speaks  
You tricked me now it's only right  
that you try my rotten treats  
Trick or treat, trick or treat  
Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)  
Mr. Rotten Treats got all the good shit  
over hereboys and girls, I got balls freshly  
picked form Detroits biggest nutsacks, I got  
Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling  
I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds rarest fudge packer  
Must return to the other side  
But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride  
Murder go round the dead body clown  
Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around  
Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?  
Thank you sonny here's a little treat now run along  
Hey buddy, you thought I was dead, man  
You probably stuffed the fuckin' shank in my head  
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one  
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun  
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to  
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?  
I send you to the other side  
Your buddies and your neighbors can come along for the ride  
Weak bitches, you thought that you had me beat  
But this aolloween I'm commin back with my Rotten Treats  
Trick or treat, trick or treat  
Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)  
Mr. Rotten Treats runs this bitch, bitch, I got  
Fried titty nipples, sweet acid drops, sweet  
chocolate coverd nipple nuggets with the fresh creamy

What The Hell Happened To Me?
Adam Sandler
----------------
Hey you guys, I just wanted to thank you for listening to the record and I
hope you had as much fun as I did and here's one last little diddy just for
you.  
I used to ride my big wheel, and sell lemonade,  
Eat popcorn with grandpa while we watched the parade  
But now I'm only happy when I'm drinking J.D.  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
I used to have fun throwing snowballs with my best friend Billy  
And Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly  
But now I only get excited when I see a girl pee  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
I used to be the nicest kid in the neighborhood  
I only did the things that Momma said I should  
But now I just do whatever I want  
I even whipped it out in a restaurant  
  
I used to help clean the park in the middle of town  
And then played kickball til the sun went down  
But now all I do is get VD,  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
It makes no sense  
I can't believe I ended on me  
I'm out of my gourd  
Won't somebody please, help me?  
  
A do-do-do-do doo a do-do waa do-do-we-oh  
  
I'm kind of a wierdo

Adam Sandler

When I'm feeling down  
And feeling sad  
You come around  
And make me glad  
I got you  
Oh, my little chicken  
  
I love your feet  
I love your breasts  
I love the way you eat gravel  
To help you digest  
Oh, my little chicken  
  
People say you're using me  
In your heart you're a killer  
But I know the worst  
I should fear is  
A slight case of salmonella  
So lie right back  
Don't you cry  
If an egg can fit in there  
Why can't I.....mmmmmmm  
Oh my little  
  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawk  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawk  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawking Bawk,  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawking Bawk

My little chicken likes  
To wear garter belts

Charisma
W.A.S.P.
----------------
I've a breathe in minds of men  
No man's ever ruled the world  
With the lies I breath  
Vanity in the lust of men  
Not knowing the curse of me  
I'm some of the seven sins  
I'm the Alfa - omega man  
I'll show you who I am  
My soul has a dark embrace  
Hypnotic charm, mesmerizing face  
Till I'm your king  
A magic tongue, I'll seduce you all  
Till ya know my charisma  
Vatican Man  
I'm a liar blinding your vision  
Preaching fear and using religion  
I wrap myself in the American Flag  
With the bible and Koran  
And tell people I'm for which it stands  
Till you believe, till you know my charisma  
I'm coming back till you know I'm God  
I'm a fear from a shadow land  
I seduce you all  
Here I come new messiah man  
To bow to me, make me your God  
I got them all marching to the rhythm  
Believing me, oh yeah, their new religion  
I'm a racist with a waving flag  
  
I'm gonna be the new world leader  
Of domination with a fascist plan  
I got a lot of 9 millimeter baby eaters  
I'm coming back til you know I'm God  
Till you belive, till you know I'm charisma  
Charisma - do you know my name  
I'm the God that you pray  
Charisma - are you idolizing me?  
When you worship my name  
I'm a dangerous thing  
Your new messiah's me

Miranda
Fleetwood Mac
----------------
At the end of the day  
The end of the light  
She keeps the remains of all of her foes  
Miranda is dying with all of her might  
She never comes  
She always goes  
  
She sticks the camera right into her arm  
Anything to forget what the trouble's about  
It causes her pain,  
That's part of the charm  
She's down for the count then finally out  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
She sees her face in another magazine  
And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight  
Can't stand to be loved,  
But she loves to be seen  
She slips down headlong into the night  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
And then all at once the sun starts to rise  
She sees her father holding her down  
All the daylight is poison to her eyes  
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
The lights shine down the marina  
All across her safety zone  
But loneliness follows Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
Miranda is always alone  
Miranda is always alone  
  
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

When I Need You
Luther Vandross
----------------
No one knows the side of you that I know  
No one gets to see, to feel you  
To hear you when they call  
I'm the only one you answer  
Because I know what to do  
I know what to do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
Miles and miles of empty space in between us  
A telephone can't take the place of your smile  
But I won't be traveling forever  
It's cold out, but hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
It's not easy when the road is your driver  
But honey that's the heavy load that we bear  
But I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out, but hold out  
And do like I do  
When I need you  
  
But I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out, oh honey, hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you baby  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
Honey, when I need you  
  
I'm in a cloud and I'm holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out for you

And talk forever just to pass the time  
I would smile as the shivers and chills  
Run down my spine  
And your eyes are locked on mine  
Oh, we'll fill the metro skies with country air  
And when you close your tired eyes  
I'll meet you there  
  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
  
Deep inside of you  
There's a ruby glow  
And it gets brighter  
Than you and I will ever know  
There's a rushing sound  
That surrounds us  
When we walk alone  
And it's everything we've never known  
  
(Wonder down the street and I will be the pavement beneath your feet)  
  
If we could just be immobile for some time  
And finally figure out the way we feel  
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks  
That still look a bit surreal  
Oh, I tend to disappear  
Here and there  
So concentrate and you'll feel me  
Everywhere  
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air  
If you're lost when you close your eyes  
I'll meet you there  
  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
I'll meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
I'll meet you there

Let Me Know
Gloria Gaynor
----------------
I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead, oh  
Just love me and mean it, I'll follow you blind  
Lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
I'll take it, I'll make it  
Ooh, yes, I will  
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Listen, listen  
  
I'm livin' each minute with all that I've got  
Each breath is in pardon, each heartbeat is hot  
That's the way we were way back, you forgot [he forgot, he forgot], ooh  
You leave me so empty, it's makin' me sad  
To know that our good thing has turned for the bad  
Both of us are here, but where's the love we had  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
Let me know, let me know  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
I'll take it  
Heaven knows I'll make it  
  
I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, and no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead, listen  
Just love me and mean it, I'll follow you blind  
Lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind, listen  
  
I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead, oh  
Just love me and mean it, I'll follow you blind  
But lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
I'll take it, I'll make it  
You know I will, you know I will  
  
I'm livin' each minute with all that I've got  
Each breath is in pardon, each heartbeat is hot  
That's the way we were way back, you forgot [he forgot, he forgot], ooh  
You leave me so empty, it's makin' me sad  
To know that our good thing has turned for the bad  
Both of us are here, but where's the love we had  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
I'll take it, I'll make it  
You know I will, you know I will  
Oh, yes, I will  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love, ooh, have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
Let me know, I've got to know, I have a right  
Before you touch me and, oh, touch me right  
Have I won your love, I don't wanna lose the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face and don't try to be polite, hoo  
  
Let me know, let me know  
Let me know, let me know, I've got a right  
I got to plan my future, my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite

Don't Let Go
Deep Purple
----------------
I get lost on a regular basis  
I'm not alone I see the same old faces  
Back on the road it's a worthy opponent  
I get home in the heat of the moment  
  
What's that stuff always rise to the surface  
College cream, it always emerges  
Be what you are I tell myself  
And myself tells me we can't be anybody else  
  
You always sleep with a smile on your face  
Much as I want to put myself in your place  
Not my business I've got dreams of my own  
I try to recall but when I wake up it's gone  
  
Don't let go of that image  
You'll never see it again  
  
I can hear voices they're buzzing in my head  
Eyebrows raised was it something I said  
A long hot night, it crept in like a thief  
The engine stopped, the seat belt popped  
And her jaw dropped in disbelief  
  
Don't let go of that beast  
You'll never see it again  
  
Don't let go of that whiskey bottle  
You'll never see it again

My Way Of Giving
Rod Stewart
----------------
I've been told it's just a matter of time  
before you meet someone who opens your eyes  
But time's on my side so nevertheless  
I know the pain of too much happiness  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all part of my way of giving  
and I'm giving it all to you  
More than love it's a way of living  
and what more would you have me do  
  
Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt  
and if at times it seems our love won't work  
I tell you honey, you must surely realize  
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt  
and if at times it seems our love won't work  
I tell you honey you must surely realize  
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes  
  
[Chorus]

Blue Water Baboon Farm
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
Walking by the river's edge  
Reach my hands to cup the sky  
Run down my arms a bitter blue  
Turn to red and the gashes grew  
  
The river taste me  
I'm so much more than I have ever been  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Take this my arms  
Take this my eyes  
Take this my mouth  
And God it seems to be  
Completely true  
Oh, oh, oh, oh... Yeah  
  
Walking by the river's edge  
Reach my hands to cup the sky  
While on my arms a bitter blue  
Turn to red and the grew  
  
The river taste me  
I'm so much more than I have ever been  
Oh, oh, oh

Just Not Today
Kenny Chesney
----------------
She played third base on a softball team  
Had a pretty good arm and a real nice swing  
I was workin' part time out at Gentry's farm  
Had a thing for a girl in a uniform  
After the game she was mine, young, wild and free  
Yeah old Mr. Gentry was pretty cool he said "son, I know where I'd be  
And what I'd say if it was me"  
  
[Chorus:]  
One of these days, I'm gonna have to grow up  
Have to get real jobs and be adult some day, just not today  
Have to worry about things out of our control  
Like kids, love and money and gettin' old someday, just not today  
Just not today  
  
Had a rope swing hanging from a sycamore tree  
By a deep little spot on white sand creek  
Used to walk barefoot down a little dirt path  
We'd throw out the beach towels and lay on our backs  
Had four wheel drive trucks parked up in the shade  
With those speakers blasting we never knew how much we really had it made  
Without a care in the world we'd say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have to show some maturity, responsibility  
Pay the ole fiddler, face reality  
Maybe tomorrow the older and wiser we'll be  
God love us we'll be  
  
One of these days, we're gonna have to grow up  
Have to get real jobs and be adult some day, just not today  
Have to worry about things out of our control  
Like kids, love and money and gettin' old someday, just not today  
Just not today  
Just not today  
Just not today

Keep Breathing
Ingrid Michaelson
----------------
The storm is coming but I don't mind.  
People are dying, I close my blinds.  
All that I know is I'm breathing now.  
  
I want to change the world, instead I sleep.  
I want to believe in more than you and me.  
But all that I know is I'm breathing.  
All I can do is keep breathing.  
All we can do is keep breathing  
Now I, now I  
Now I, now, now  
  
All that I know is I'm breathing.  
All I can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]  
  
All we can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]  
Now

I Will Praise The Lord
Ray Boltz
----------------
I Will Praise The Lord  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz  
Bleeding in the darkness  
The cell was cold and black  
Driven to unconsciousness  
By the stripes upon His back  
He heard a voice call out his name  
His mind began to clear  
And in the darkness he replied,  
Silas, I am here  
You know my brother Silas,  
Paul uttered with a groan,  
Today I thought for sure  
We were going home  
And when I opened up my eyes  
I'd look upon His face  
But here we are together  
In this dreadful place  
Chorus:  
But I will praise the Lord  
I will praise the Lord  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
Or what it has in store  
I know I will praise the Lord  
This may be a prison  
These may be chains  
Still I am free  
Free to praise His name  
In tribulation  
My heart still sings  
He is Messiah  
He is the King of Kings  
Prisoners started waking up  
Singing filled their ears  
Some men started swearing  
Others were in tears  
Then suddenly it happened  
There was no mistake  
As Paul and Silas praised the Lord  
The walls began to shake  
Chorus  
1989 Shepherd Boy Musicascap.

I've Always Been Crazy
Waylon Jennings
----------------
I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through  
And busted for things that I did, and I didn't do  
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done  
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone  
  
I've always been different with one foot over the line  
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind  
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane  
  
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand  
The chances your taking loving a free living man  
Are you really sure you really want what you see  
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be  
  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane  
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame  
So, far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane

Schizo
Venom
----------------
Children gather round him,  
Mystery surrounds him,  
What terrible secret does he hide,  
An ordinary man,  
Doing what he can,  
But what goes on inside his mind.  
  
The night draws nigh,  
With darkened sky's,  
Axe blade shines,  
Midnight chimes.  
  
Morning comes around,  
Headless bodies found,  
Our little friend just sits and smiles ha ha,  
Take them home and love them,  
Read the bible to them,  
Be sure to kiss each one goodnight.  
  
But come the night,  
You'll freeze with fright,  
Axe drawn high,  
Another dies.  
  
Creeping and searching for victims unknowing,  
What fate doth await round each corner,  
The take in the night,  
He's got you in his sight.  
  
Now that I have warned you,  
Always look behind you,  
You'll never know just who'll be there,  
That harmless looking dear,  
May be the one to fear,  
So never trust those you don't know.  
  
But come the night,  
You'll freeze with fright,  
Axe drawn high,  
The bastards die.

Never Tear Us Apart
INXS
----------------
Don't ask me  
What you know is true  
Don't have to tell you  
I love your precious heart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
We could live  
For a thousand years  
But if I hurt you  
I'd make wine from your tears  
  
I told you  
That we could fly  
'Cause we all have wings  
But some of us don't know why  
  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never ever tear us apart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
You were standing  
I was there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided

Am I Blue
George Strait
----------------
[Chorus]  
Am I blue  
Yes I'm blue  
It started the day I lost you  
Nobody ever loved somebody like I do  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
  
Just this mornin'  
over coffee  
I sat there cryin'  
cause you're gone long gone  
I didn't know just how much  
I was gonna miss you  
till I spent my first night alone  
Am I blue  
Yes I'm blue  
How could I have been such a fool  
Now look at all the misery I'm going through  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
Tried to call and say I'm sorry  
I couldn't get you on the line  
You'll never know just how much  
I'm wishin' you would show up  
and say you've changed your mind  
  
[Chorus]

Images Of Loving
Squeeze
----------------
Your initials on the singles  
That you chose to leave behind  
Sit in my collection  
They get played from time to time  
Left to remind me of something I'd forgot  
The images of loving before I lost the plot  
What was love to us  
Just sensation  
What was love to us  
The invitation  
To sit on my bed stand by a tree  
What were we feeling  
What was love to us  
  
The stagecoach would get held up  
On a Sunday afternoon  
We're dozing by the TV  
On a sofa with no room  
No room to lay out flat with her there by my side  
One eye on her movements one eye on Rawhide  
  
I just wasn't made for these times  
Spun around my record deck  
How green was my valley  
How blue the eyes that wept  
Looking back I don't think that I really cared  
This was my first lesson with nothing to compare

So many girls in here, where do I begin?

Just the other day mi go London, saw that, kids down the street

Coming through the club all the girls in the back of me

Looking like he wanna good time like really  
Said he had a friend for my home girl Lilly Lilly, Lilly, Lilly

One Fine Day
Offspring
----------------
If I had a perfect day  
I would have it start this way  
Open up the fridge and have a tall boy  
Yeah  
  
Then I'd meet up with my friends  
Head out to the game again  
We don't even really care who wins (hey) wins (hey) 1, 2, 3  
  
[Chorus]  
Now excitement seems to grow  
When we're hangin' with the bro's  
When we're chillin' and we pound  
A case of stroh's  
Now the game is cool to see  
You can high five on TV  
Count the riot on the 1, 2, 3  
Operation is in sight  
And the field is open wide  
When you break it then you know you're still alive  
If the cops don't make you pay  
And you make your getaway  
Then you know  
That's one fine day  
  
On that day before we're through  
We could torch a car or two  
Then have ourselves another tall boy  
Yeah  
  
Water hoses and batons  
That's the real game that's on  
I don't really give a shit who wins (hey) wins (hey) 1, 2, 3  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe it's my God-given right  
To destroy everything in my sight  
'cause it never gets dull  
It never gets old (whoa-oh)  
The only thing it gets is more bold (whoa-oh-oh)  
Drinkin', fightin', going to the game (whoa-oh)  
In our world it's a way to stay sane (whoa-oh-oh)  
If you're asking me (whoa-oh-oh-oh)  
To have it my way (whoa-oh)  
I'd say that's one fine day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then you know that it's one fine day  
(Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Don't Leave Me This Way
Tina Turner
----------------
All of my life, all of my life  
I've been searching for a love like ours  
Somewhere to stay, somewhere safe in your arms  
I was so sure  
Are you really saying your heart's changing  
Do you really mean goodbye  
  
Don't leave me this way, no, no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
  
Say what's on your mind, one thing at a time  
And I promise you we'll talk it through  
Don't walk away, there's so much more to say  
Though my words seem lost on you  
Can't believe you're talking like we're just friends  
Can't you see the tears I cry  
  
Don't leave me this way, no, no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
  
Are you really saying your heart's changing  
Do you really mean it this time  
Baby  
  
Don't leave me this way, oh no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
No, don't tell me that it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (don't leave me this way)  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (oh you're gonna leave me now)  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way  
  
Don't leave me this way  
If you'll just take a little bit of time  
You just might want to change your mind  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way

Look Through My Eyes
Phil Collins
----------------
There are things in life you learn  
And oh in time you'll see  
It's out there somewhere  
It's all waiting  
If you keep believing  
So don't run  
Don't hide  
It will be alright  
You'll see  
Trust me  
I'll be there watching over you  
  
Just take a look through my eyes  
There's a better place somewhere out there  
Just take a look through my eyes  
Everything changes  
You'll be amazed what you'll find  
(There's a better place)  
If you look through my eyes  
  
There will be times on this journey  
All you'll see is darkness  
But out there somewhere  
Daylight finds you  
If you keep believing  
So don't run  
Don't hide  
It will be alright  
You'll see  
Trust me  
I'll be there watching over you  
  
Just take a look through my eyes  
there's better place somewhere out there  
Just take a look through my eyes  
Everything changes  
You'll be amazed what you'll find  
(There's a better place)  
If you look through my eyes  
  
All the things that you can change  
There's a meaning in everything  
And you will find all you need  
There's so much to understand  
Take a look (take a look) through my eyes  
there's a better place somewhere out there  
Just take a look (take a look) through my eyes  
Everything changes  
You'll be amazed what you'll find  
(You'll be amazed if you just take a look)  
Look through my eyes there's a better place somewhere out there  
Just take a look through my eyes  
Everything changes  
You'll be amazed what you'll find  
If you look through my eyes  
Just take a look through my eyes  
If you look through my eyes  
Take a look through my eyes

Home
Natalie Grant
----------------
You keep watching the rain come down (yeah)  
Pretty princess, broken crown (yeah)  
And your dreams have all burned out  
But don't you know that they brought you  
Here somehow, all you need to know is  
  
You're home, where secrets are told  
See a new world unfolding  
Where hearts are one, the pain's undone  
And your finally belonging, yeah  
And you need to know, you need to know  
You're home, yeah  
You need to know, you need to know  
You're home  
So take your coat off and stay awhile (yeah)  
What made you cry can make you smile again  
You can hold your head up high  
Cause don't you know that you  
Oh, girl you were born to fly  
When you realize  
You're home, where secrets are told  
See a new world unfolding  
Where hearts are one, the pain's undone  
And your finally belonging, yeah  
And you need to know, you need to know  
You're home, yeah  
You need to know  
All you really need to know is you're home  
Welcome home  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Cause you're home  
Feel the sun, your day has come  
You're not alone  
You're home

Tennessee Square
Whiskeytown
----------------
Red ribbons hanging up  
Tennessee Square  
Old people laughing and singing  
And dancing down there  
I'd like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddy's chair  
Ferris wheel lights look like pictures  
I'd seen in a book somewhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me I'm going nowhere  
I'd like to join them  
I got no money to spare  
So I sit here and watch from the porch  
Drinking whiskey in granddaddy's chair  
It's difficult to go on  
Knowing you're out there somwhere  
Vacant parking lots across the street  
Remind me I'm going nowhere

James
Billy Joel
----------------
James, we were always friends  
From our childhood days  
And we made our plans  
And we had to go our separate ways.  
I went on the road  
You pursued an education.  
  
James, do you like your life?  
Can you find release?  
Will you ever change?  
Will you ever write your masterpiece?  
Are you still in school  
Living up to expectations? James  
  
You were so relied upon  
Everybody knows how hard you tried.  
Hey, look at what a job you've done  
Carrying the weight of family pride.  
  
James, you've been well behaved,  
You've been working hard  
But will you always stay  
Someone else's dream of who you are?  
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.  
  
I went on the road,  
You pursued an education, James  
  
How you gonna know for sure?  
Everything was so well organized.  
Hey, now everything is so secure  
And everybody else is satisfied.  
  
James, do you like your life?  
Can you find release?  
Will you ever change?  
When will you write your masterpiece?  
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.

Georgy Porgy
Toto
----------------
It's not your situation, I just need contemplation over you  
I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love  
  
Not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Just think how long I've known you, it's long for me to own you, lock and key  
It's really not confusing, I'm just the young illusion, can't you see  
  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry  
  
It's not your situation, I just need contemplation over you  
I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love  
  
Not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them high  
  
Georgy Porgy  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them high  
Georgy Porgy  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry

Momma Cried
Alison Krauss
----------------
Momma loved us, every one  
Every daughter, every son  
She gave herself so happily  
That's just the way she was, you see  
From dawn to dark she'd find a chore  
And work it 'til it was no more  
And every day until she died  
In the evening, momma cried  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
Her little girl was snatched away  
She was there and then just gone one day  
And momma blamed herself, I'd say  
But all of us had debts to pay  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
I did my best to cheer her pride  
That day that something broke inside  
I swore I'd find her and I tried  
In the evening, momma cried  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone

If I Walk Away
Josh Groban
----------------
Lately, I've been the quiet one  
Waiting searching the lines of the songs you played for me  
Sailing into the misty air  
Fading bound for I don't know where  
When I'm there I'll see  
  
And If I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Weightless drifting through stars I got  
Faithless woke in the dark and I made this from my dream  
Play me all your sweet rhymes  
Recreate me, now comes the time when I'll need your truth to see  
  
And if I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Walk away  
Let the fear fall away  
Into the fire you made  
Scarlet and gold  
Walk away  
Head for the light of day  
Follow a brighter way  
Out of the cold and dark  
Down to the one bright spark  
Futures that all might start  
Someday  
  
So if I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Fragments shells of a long ago lifetime  
Faces that once were mine  
Thrown down by the sea  
  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Would you please follow me

The Table
Beautiful South
----------------
This table has four sturdy legs  
And a heart of very near wild oak  
When others would have screamed out loud my friend  
This one never even spoke  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
This table's been pushed against the door  
When tempers, well tempers flare at night  
Banged upon with knuckles clenched my friend  
When someone thinks that they are right  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
Tables only turn when tables learn  
Put me on a bonfire, watch me burn  
Treat me with some dignity, don't treat me like a slave  
Or I'll turn into the coffin in your grave  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
Tables only turn when tables learn  
Put me on a bonfire, watch me burn  
Treat me with some dignity, don't treat me like a slave  
Or I'll turn into the coffin in your grave

White Dove
Lynyrd Skynyrd
----------------
One, two, three, two, two, three  
  
White dove sittin' on a blackberry bush  
Is there any questioning why  
Tell me what heaven you're bound for today  
Feel just like I could cry  
Feel just like I could cry  
  
Little squirrel sitting on a flat slanted rock  
Wondering where the winter meal is coming from  
Tired of fighting for it, gonna lay down my gun  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
  
Little boy blue now come blow your horn  
No more of the sheep is around  
Said I'm tired of fighting, gonna lay down my gun  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done

California Sunshine Woman
Roy Orbison
----------------
California woman  
Hanging heavy on my mind  
Never found another like her  
Guess she was just one of a kind  
She never wrapped no strings around me  
She could treat a man so fine  
I still see her golden hair  
And the Caliifornia sunshine  
Mississippi rain falling on my head  
No California woman sleeping in my bed  
Makes me wanna move on, leave all this behind  
I need my California woman and the California sunshine  
Golden California beaches  
Knocking on a beach house door  
They say that California woman  
She don't live here anymore  
They say she left with a stranger  
Leaving nothing left behind  
She buried all my dreams here  
In the California sunshine  
Mississippi rain falling on my head  
No California woman sleeping in my bed  
Makes me wanna move on, leave all this behind  
I need my California woman and the California sunshine  
I need my California woman and the California sunshine

Alma Mater
Grease
----------------
As I go travelling down lifes highway  
whatever course my fortunes may foretell  
I shall not go alone on my way  
for thou shall always be with me Rydell  
  
When I seek rest from worldly matters  
in palace or in hovel I may dwell  
and though my bed be silk or tatters  
my dreams shall always be of thee Rydell  
  
Through all the years, Rydell  
And tears, Rydell  
We give three cheers Rydell for thee  
  
Through everything Rydell  
We cling, Rydell  
And sing, Rydell to thee

Dark Side Of The Sun
John Waite
----------------
I looked over my shoulder  
Straight into your eyes  
As you stood in my shadow  
In some loud disguise  
  
You were lookin' straight through me  
Like a piece of glass  
Out of step with the fashion  
Fashions always pass  
  
I've been living  
On the dark side of the sun  
Waiting for something  
That would never come  
  
Feeling restless and jaded  
My heartbeat paralyzed  
Like some refugee hero  
To beat denounced and denied  
  
In some rock and roll wasteland  
In a thousand hours  
While Madonnas keep smiling  
Present them with the flowers  
  
I've been living  
On the dark side of the sun  
Waiting for something  
That would never come  
  
And I've been running down the shadows  
Like a street gang to survive  
Hoping for something to keep me alive  
I looked over my shoulder  
  
Fire in my eyes  
We were looking for justice  
What we got was a great big surprise  
We've been living  
  
On the dark side of the sun  
Waiting for something  
That would never come  
And we've been running from the shadows  
  
Like some street gang to survive  
Waiting for something to keep us alive  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Been living on the dark side  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
And I've been running from the shadows  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh

The Three Day Man
Waterboys
----------------
I'm the three day man  
It's three days too long  
Everything is in its right place but  
Something is wrong  
Time is on wheels  
And my legs shake  
I have to live with every decision  
That you make  
  
And that doesn't mean  
That I'll be your slave  
It doesn't mean you're here to stay  
It doesn't mean we're friends for life  
You know I want you  
You know that I love you  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
  
Sixes and sevens  
Oh how it rains  
Sleep is a station  
Life is a train  
People snatch instinctively for  
Whatever crutch they need  
But I promise not to abuse you  
If you don't love me leave  
  
And that means  
That I'll be never your slave  
It means that you're not here to stay  
Means that we're not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
  
And that means  
That I'll be never your slave  
It means you're not here to stay  
Means we're not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you!

Going To A Go-Go
Rolling Stones
----------------
Going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go, c'mon now  
Going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go, c'mon now  
  
Well there's a brand new place I found  
People coming from miles around  
They come from everywhere  
If you drop in there  
You see everyone in town  
  
Going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go, c'mon now  
Don't you wanna go  
And that's alright tell me  
  
Going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go  
  
It doesn't matter if you're black  
It doesn't matter if you're white  
Take a dollar fifty  
A six pack of beer  
And we goin' dance all night  
  
Going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go, c'mon now  
Don't you wanna go  
And that's alright, tell me  
  
Yeah, don't you wanna go, and that's alright, tell me  
  
Going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go  
  
It doesn't matter you come in drag  
It doesn't matter you come in stag  
I'm telling everyone to get down here  
Every taxi that you flag  
  
Is going to a go go, everybody  
Going to a go go  
Don't you wanna go  
And that's alright, tell me, yeah  
That's alright, yeah

Dominic
Elvis Presley
----------------
Dominic, Dominic why are you stallin'  
Don't you hear love callin' to you  
Moo, moo, move your little foot do  
  
Dominic, Dominic pick one of them ticker  
There's acres and acres to choose  
Oh, oh, only a fool would refuse  
  
I, I, if I had your trouble  
Life would be double good sweet  
There'd be no grass growin' under my feet  
  
Listen Dominic, Dominic when will you hunger  
You ain't gettin' younger my friend  
Love, love, love 'em all right to the end  
  
I, I, I can't understand you, leavin' them beauties forlorn  
It's time to take the old bull by the horn  
Come on Dominic, Dominic, they're itchin' and twitchin'  
Better start pickin' some woo  
Moo, moo, move your little foot do!

Wear Me Down
Blur
----------------
Every time I come here  
I'm not sure what to say  
I know it should be easy  
But it never seems that way  
  
You, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why, why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still?  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I can't fight  
You, you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I can't fight  
  
I can't say I love you easily  
But you wouldn't want me to  
So I'd rather just say nothing  
And leave it up to you  
  
Then it's easy to forget  
You're just as small as me  
Then it's easy to forget  
You're just as foolish as me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why, why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still?  
  
[Chorus]

Written In Sand
Santana
----------------
Your eyes are the color of the sea  
You look my way and the waves  
Wash over me  
Your body shivers with the  
Fading light  
You say,  
"Baby, let's just make it last tonight"  
  
And when the morning comes  
You take me by the hand  
And say our love is written in sand  
Written in sand  
  
We hear the ocean roar  
We're swept away on to some  
Distant shore  
You whisper secrets of the heart  
They keep us close when the  
World keeps us apart  
  
Until tomorrow comes  
Time is on our hands  
Because this love is written in  
Sand  
Written in sand  
  
Nothing lies between  
A woman and a man  
When their love is written in sand  
When their love is written in sand  
When their love is written in sand

How Do I Tell Her
Luther Vandross
----------------
(How)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(Oh, yeah)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
I'm doing all I can to try and understand  
Why my feelings faded away  
She's been nothin' but good to me  
I don't wanna hurt her but I must be free  
I can't stay in this love, how do I say goodbye  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(No)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(I don't wanna be here)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
She pretends she cannot see  
The love is gone from me  
She carries on as if it is what it was before  
But I don't love her anymore  
I have to let her know  
That I must let her go  
I can't stay in this life  
How do I say goodbye  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(Oh, girl)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
Oh, I don't know what to do about it  
Gotta tell her, gotta tell her, gotta tell her  
Oh, there's no way to go around it  
I've got to tell her now but I don't know how  
(Listen, listen, baby)  
(Listen closely, baby)  
I just gotta tell you  
All the love we once had is through  
(Listen, listen, baby)  
(Listen closely, baby)  
(Closely)  
I don't wanna be with you anymore  
(Anymore)  
I can't stay, I can't stay  
(I can't stay)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(I don't wanna be here)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(I don't)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't know)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her

Leave
Tragically Hip
----------------
Do you mean the attack is routine?  
A bird asked of a bird  
In this context, a concave nest  
How do we learn to hurt?  
Do you mean there's no variation?  
Watching a dog charge a flock  
Of birds exploding in congregation  
Why plan, when when we stop?  
I don't know but why suppose  
'Cause it's not the way it should be?  
When you can fly above the great waiting list  
As the crow implies, we won't be missed  
We can leave, we can leave, we can leave, you leave  
It's a routine flight for this bird tonight  
There's more worms than earth in the after life  
Where the blind feed the blind, whispering things like  
"On the money" and "Bullseye"  
She picks up the little leaves  
Where human wrecks are left to seed  
Left to repaint their deities  
And plaster away at their villainies  
Where there's love and there's hope  
And do you hope those earthbound poets  
Could learn to sing as good as us?  
So we can sit back and enjoy our illusions and our quietus?  
Well I don't know but why suppose  
It's not the way it should be  
When you can squawk and wait for a word from above  
And change yourself into something you love when you leave?  
You leave, you leave

Rosemary
Lenny Kravitz
----------------
Little Mary was five years old  
Her parents left her, she was out in the cold  
Alone to live and find her way  
In this great world of heartache and pain  
  
Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold  
Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled  
Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare  
Who could have left a child so rare  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm beggin you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
A burning heart and tired eyes  
Howling winds for lullabys  
No one there to soothe her fright  
Nowhere to turn but the inward light  
Because life is for believing  
That your heart can turn to gold  
All you need is Christ to receive it  
There's eternal life for every soul  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm begging you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
He loves you He needs you He wants you  
So don't let Him down

In The Misty Moonlight
Hank Snow
----------------
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right long as I'm with you  
In a faraway land on the trophic sea sand  
If your hand's in my hand I won't be blue  
Way up on the mountain a way down in the valley  
I know I'll be happy anyplace anywhere I don't care  
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight  
Any place is all right long as you are there  
I could be happy in one little room with only a table and a chair  
As happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you were there  
I could be rich or I could be poor in fact if you were by my side  
I could be anything in the whole wide world and I know I'll be satisfied  
Way up on the mountain...

Something Beautiful
Robbie Williams
----------------
You can't manufacture a miracle  
The silence was pitiful that day.  
A love is getting too cynical  
Passion's just physical these days  
You analyze everyone you meet  
But get no sign, love ain't kind  
Every night you admit defeat  
And cry yourself blind  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you can't wake up in the morning  
Cause your bed lies vacant at night  
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely  
Can't control it, try as you might  
May you find that love that won't leave you  
May you find it by the end of the day  
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely  
Something beautiful will come your way  
  
The DJ said on the radio  
Life should be stereo, each day  
In the past you cast the unsuitable  
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait  
All your friends think you're satisfied  
But they can't see your soul no, no, no  
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone  
  
[Chorus  
  
Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4]  
  
All your friends think you're satisfied  
But they can't see your soul no no no  
Forgot the time feeling petrified  
When they lived alone  
  
[Chorus]

Juicy John Pink
Procol Harum
----------------
I opened my eyes this morning and I wasn't at home in bed  
There was four angels standing round me, I thought "I must be dead"  
Well, I opened my eyes this morning, thought "I must be dead"  
Four angels standing round me, and the room was painted red  
  
Won't you have my sugar, on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven it's not hell where I belong  
Yeah  
  
Well, the stars began to tremble, and rain began to fall  
Four angels standing round me an it wasn't no social call  
Well, the stars began to tremble, and rain began to fall  
I got down on my knees praying Lord, but it didn't do no good at all  
  
Won't you have my sugar, on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven it's not hell where I belong  
Yeah

Caribbean Blue
Enya
----------------
Eurus  
Afer Ventus  
  
So the world goes round and round  
With all you ever knew  
They say the sky high above  
Is Caribbean blue  
  
If every man says all he can,  
If every man is true,  
Do I believe the sky above  
Is Caribbean blue  
  
Boreas  
Zephryus  
  
If all you told was turned to gold,  
If all you dreamed were new,  
Imagine sky high above  
In Caribbean blue

Afer Ventus  
Boreas  
Zephryus

After Hours
Velvet Underground
----------------
One, two, three  
If you close the door  
The night could last forever  
Leave the sunshine out  
And say hello to never  
  
All the people are dancing  
And they're having such fun  
I wish it could happen to me  
  
But if you close the door  
I'd never have to see the day again  
  
If you close the door  
The night could last forever  
Leave the wine-glass out  
And drink a toast to never  
  
Oh, someday I know  
Someone will look into my eyes  
And say hello  
You're my very special one  
  
But if you close the door  
I'd never have to see the day again  
  
Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars  
And the people on subways and trains  
Looking gray in the rain,  
As they stand disarrayed  
Oh, but people look well in the dark  
  
And if you close the door  
The night could last forever  
Leave the sunshine out  
And say hello to never  
  
All the people are dancing  
And they're having such fun  
I wish it could happen to me  
  
Cause if you close the door  
I'd never have to see the day again  
I'd never have to see the day again,  
Once more  
I'd never have to see the day again

He Man Woman Hater
Extreme
----------------
"No Women Allowed!"  
Let me tell you about this love and hate relation  
Between a man and a woman  
And so none of you all get the wrong interpretation  
I can't live with them  
I'm gonna die without them  
  
Sooner or later  
You'll be a he man woman hater  
It's inevitable  
And to become one  
You've gotta really hate to love them  
He man woman hater  
He, he man woman hater  
You know I love to hate cause I hate to love them  
  
He man's behavior  
Doesn't need no explanation

He men have always had a sexual preoccupation  
It's gonna be your place or it's gonna be mine  
  
Sooner or later  
You'll be a he man woman hater  
It's inevitable  
And to become one  
You've gotta really hate to love them

You know I love to hate cause I hate to love them  
He, he man woman hater  
Can't live with em gonna die without 'em

Strangers Of The Heart
Heart
----------------
Through the mist on the harbor  
Dancing lights on the water  
Shadows move I see you smiling again  
When I reach out to touch you  
Like a ghost looking through me  
Sending chills deep into me  
Shattered dreams falling like  
Teardrops again  
As you make me remember  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Don't take chances they'll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I don't want to be  
Strangers at heart  
  
Broken glass of my mirror  
Makes my eyes see much clearer  
You and I only a whisper away  
Never telling each other  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Don't take chances they'll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I don't want to be  
Strangers at heart  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Don't take chances they'll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I don't want to be  
Strangers at heart

Monday, Monday
Neil Diamond
----------------
Monday, Monday  
So good to me  
Monday morning,  
It was all I hoped it would be  
  
Oh, Monday morning  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Monday, Monday  
Can't trust that day  
Monday, Monday  
Sometimes it just turns out that way  
  
Oh, Monday morning  
You gave me no warning  
Of what was to be  
Oh, Monday, Monday  
  
How could you leave and not take me  
Every other day  
Every other day,  
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying all of the time  
Monday, Monday  
  
So good to me  
Monday morning  
It was all I hoped it would be  
Oh, Monday morning  
  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying all of the time  
Monday, Monday  
  
Can't trust that day  
Monday, Monday  
Turns out that way  
Monday, Monday

Tonight
Xscape
----------------
Come a little bit closer and look into my eyes,  
If only for a moment, boy don't be surprised.  
I want you right here next to me,  
So tell me we can spend some time.  
  
So I can hold you softly,  
In these gentle arms of mine.  
And the moonlight's gazing,ooh,  
Shining on my window pane,  
  
Beaming down on the midnight hour,  
I hear the sound of rain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tonight, tonight, ooh...  
Tonight, tonight, ooh...  
  
So why don't you stay awhile,  
I can't help it if you put me in a daze boy.  
But you look so good to me,  
In your satin PJs.  
  
So let's make love by candlelight,  
And listen to the quiet storm.  
As I kiss you in the places,  
That make your body warm.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
I'm holding you  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Holding you tight all through the night  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Looks like it's gonna rain  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Holding you tight all through the night  
  
Tonight.

And I Love Her
Cliff Richard
----------------
I give her all my love  
That's all I do  
And if you saw my love  
You'd love her too  
I love her  
She gives me everything  
And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
And I love her  
A love like ours  
Could never die  
As long as I have you near me  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her

Faces Of America
Dan Fogelberg
----------------
There was a time, a simpler time  
When a man could be sure of where he stood  
I used to work at the yard, working honest and hard  
The hours were long but the pay was oh so good  
I had a family and friends, oh so many friends  
We'd drive to the lake on holidays  
Back then it wasn't so dear for a sandwich or beer  
At night I still dream I can see their faces  
Certain things that you depend upon  
There are places that you know  
And the faces of america  
Oh, where do they go, where did they go  
I was born on a farm, a mid-western farm  
I rode on the tractor with my dad  
And though we never had much it was always enough  
And we made the best with what we had  
But then came four years of drought and the bottom dropped out  
My father was broken like the rest  
And I can still see his hands signing over his lands  
And the bankers grow fat on the flesh of the dispossessed  
Certain things that you depend upon  
There are places I can go I sift the ashes of america  
For someplace I used to know  
Someplace I used to know  
Someplace I used to know  
There was a time, a simpler time  
When a man could be sure of where he stood  
I used to work at the yard, working honest and hard  
The hours were long but the pay was oh so good  
Certain things that you depend upon I used to think were guaranteed  
Like the right of every man to work and feed his family  
And the faces of america seem so distant and estranged  
Have their eyes become too blind to see  
How much their hearts have changed  
How much their hearts have changed  
How much their hearts have changed

The Things I Might Have Been
Wanda Jackson
----------------
(The things I might have been)  
I might have been a helpless soul with nothing much in store  
I might have been without a gold just dream and nothing more  
I might have known a life alone but that's where you came in  
Your lovin' arms have saved me from the things I might have been  
  
I might have been a kind who roam a stranger everywhere  
Or one of those for stay at home with no one's lips to share  
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin  
Keep lovin' me don't let me be the things I might have been  
The things I might have been

Better The Devil You Know
Kylie Minogue
----------------
Better the devil you know  
Better the devil you know  
Woah Better the devil you know  
Better the devil you know  
Woah woah woah  
  
Say you won't leave me no more  
I'll take you back again  
No more excuses no, no  
'Cause I've heard them all before  
A hundred times or more  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll forgive and forget  
If you say you'll never go  
'Cause its true what they say  
It's better the devil you know  
  
Woh woh woh  
Our love wasn't perfect I know  
I think I know the score  
If you say you love me, oh boy  
I can't ask for more  
I'll come if you should call  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be here every day  
Waiting for your love to show  
Yes it's true what they say  
It's better the devil you know  
  
Woh woh woh  
I'll take you back I'll take you back again  
I'll take you back I'll take you back again  
  
[Chorus until fade]

Following The Sun
Enigma
----------------
Following the sun, to find the one  
Who's giving you the wings to fly  
Following the sun, the golden one  
Losing sense for space and time  
  
Can you feel the waves of life  
(Can you) hear the sigh of love  
Do you believe in it ?  
  
Following the sun, just for the one  
Till you'll find the door you thought  
Following the sun, like everyone  
Searching for a sign of hope  
  
Have a look up to the sky  
See the billion stars above  
'cause (maybe) on one of them  
You'll spend your further life

Man's Road
America
----------------
Horizon rising up to meet the purple dawn  
Dust demon screaming, bring an eagle to lead me on  
For in my heart I carry such a heavy load  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road  
  
I'm hungry, weary, but I cannot lay me down  
The rain comes, dreary, but there's no shelter I have found  
It will be a long time till I find my abode  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road  
  
Moon rising, disguising lonely streets in gay displays  
The stars fade, the night shade falls and makes the world afraid  
It waits in silence for the sky to explode  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road  
Walking Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road

Out Of Control
U2
----------------
Monday morning  
Eighteen years of dawning  
I say how long  
You say how long  
  
It was one dull morning  
Woke the world with bawling  
I was so sad (so sad)  
It was so bad  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control  
  
Boys and girls  
Go to the school and girls  
They make children  
Not like this one  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control  
  
(Out of control)  
  
I fought fate  
There's blood on the garden gate  
The man said childhood  
It's in his childhood  
  
One day I'll die  
The choice will not be mine  
Will it be too late  
You can't fight it  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control

I Believe In You
Bette Midler
----------------
I don't believe in superstars  
In fancy food or foreign cars  
That Hagen Dazs and motherhood  
Have done my body any good.  
That Elvis is alive and well  
That courtesy has gone to Hell  
That kindness is in short supply  
That little kids should have to die.  
  
But I believe in love.  
I believe in dreamers.  
I believe in miracles  
And I believe in you.  
  
Well, I don't believe virginity  
Is as common as it used to be  
That left is wrong and right is right  
That black is black and white is white.  
That the Beatles could be history  
The sixties just a memory  
That war will never go away  
That Johnny Carson's had his day.  
  
But I believe in love  
I believe in angels  
I believe in Mom and Dad  
And I believe in you  
  
I know with almost certainty  
What's going on with you and me  
Is a good thing  
I know it's true  
I believe in you.  
  
Now, I don't believe that Heaven waits  
For only those who congregate  
I like to think that God is love.  
He's down below, He's up above,  
And He's watching people everywhere  
He knows who does and doesn't care.  
And I'm an ordinary girl  
Trying to make my way in this old world.  
  
And I believe in love  
Yes, I believe in music  
I believe in promises  
And I believe in you.  
  
Well, I know with almost certainty  
What's going on with you and me  
Is a good thing, a good thing  
And I know it's true  
I believe in you.  
  
You know darlin', that I believe in love.  
Yes, I believe in dreamers  
I believe in miracle  
And I believe in you.  
  
Woah-ho-ho-oh baby, I believe  
Yes, I believe.  
I believe in promises  
And I believe in you.  
  
Woah, come on, baby, say you believe in love.  
Say you believe in dreamin'.  
Believe in blue, blue skies,  
'Cause I believe in you . . .

Do I Love You
Judy Garland
----------------
After that sweet Summer afternoon  
When for the first time I saw you appear,  
Dreaming of you I composed a tune,  
So will you listen to it, dear?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I?  
If you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day,  
What would life be?  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you for ever?  
Isn't heaven forever more?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,  
Don't you know I do?  
Don't I show you I do,  
Just as you love me?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I?  
If you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day,  
What would life be?  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you for ever?  
Isn't heaven forever more?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,  
Don't you know I do?  
Don't I show you I do,  
Just as you love me?

Somewhere
Soundgarden
----------------
I wish a wish I dream to dream  
I try to try and I live to live  
And die to die and I cry to cry  
But I know why  
  
Somewhere in my dreams  
Things that should  
Still the willow weeps  
On roses for the dead  
In laughs of love  
  
From the likes of her  
To time of me  
Like to moon to earth  
Or the sky to sea  
Only were no longer  
Allowed to be, to be  
  
Somewhere in the dreams  
Of those who should  
Live in all the keeps  
Echo all the worlds  
In laughs of love  
  
For times that pass my life  
I'll search for the sky  
That she wonders by  
  
Somewhere in the dreams  
That the skies hold  
Still the willow weeps  
On roses for her bed  
In laughs of love

Fire And Rain
Andy Williams
----------------
Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone  
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
I just can't remember who to send it to  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus  
You've got to help me make a stand  
You've just got to see me through another day  
My body's aching and my time is at hand  
I won't make it any other way  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around  
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to  
Come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now  
  
Thought I'd see you one more time again  
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now  
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now  
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now  
  
Thought I'd see you one more time again  
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now  
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Fatal
Pearl Jam
----------------
How good is he?  
How warm are his eyes  
You'll see it's not a reprise  
Did he arrive  
  
Too late and too tethered away  
To put on his suit and his tie?  
How good is he?  
How warm is his heart  
  
Or ego telling him which place to park  
Did he relate, the message is clearly hardly  
Grounds for dismissal outright  
Grounds for dismissal outright  
  
I wake up and wait up  
When anger's in fashion  
I wake up and wait up  
It echoes through the mansions  
  
I wake up and wait up  
When April's in may, oh uh oh  
I wake up and wait up  
The answers are fatal  
  
The answers are fatal  
When I wait up and wake up  
The answers are fatal  
If he's truly out of sight  
  
Is he truly out of mind?  
If he's truly out of sight..

Holy Cross
Old 97's
----------------
You work for 37 years  
Drivin' trucks, not shiftin' gears  
He never got it in his head  
To settle down, he'd never wed.  
  
He liked the river how it flowed.  
Unlike the breaker, never to explode.  
It had no wires runnin' in  
It just went on and on and on until the ocean got to it.  
  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well it's more than a job  
It's more like a damnation  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Holy Cross  
  
It was a honey of a night  
He met his maker, he saw the light.  
The car was passin' on a curve  
He never slowed down, he never swerved.  
  
And in the hot glare of the lamps  
He had regrets, he'd never learned to dance.  
There was no angel at his side  
There was a Thermos that became homeless when he died.  
  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well it's more than a job  
It's more like a damnation  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well it's more than a job  
It's more like a damnation  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Holy Cross  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Holy Cross

We Are Who We Are
Little Mix
----------------
Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am  
My face, my eyes, someone turn me up, I'm speaking my mind  
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me, but now I like what I see  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines, I'm never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am  
She told me I should look up on the world with my head held high  
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me, but now I like what I see  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines, I'm never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines, I'm never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me

Hydra
Toto
----------------
There was a man  
He walked around  
Searching for the girl who had just caught his eye  
"I was a fool!" he cried  
His mind had wandered  
He blinked and the sky moved e'er so slightly  
He searched the city and she was nowhere to be found  
Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you want your freedom  
Do you want my love  
Do you want your freedom  
From the one you're thinking of  
  
There lies a lady  
Naked and yet not knowing  
A spell, it gains her heart forever  
Preyed upon by the wolves in Time Square  
Fell into an abyss of dead air  
Innocence caged in sanctuary  
There sat the Dragon Lord  
Playing solitary  
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly a voice was heard  
Ina a flash the brave young man appeared  
The Dragon will cut him with his tail  
Chased him to the stairway  
Caught him halfway to the top  
Sent him whirling down  
Fireball, summer solstice  
Dragon Lord descended down on him  
She turned to look but saw only darkness, silence  
  
[Chorus]

This Is The House
Eurythmics
----------------
Esta es la casa (This is the house)  
Este es el cerro (This is the hill)  
Esta es la historia (This is the story)  
Es algo chiquitito (It's a little thing)  
  
This is the house  
This is the hill  
This is the story, it's a little thing  
A lock of hair  
An invisible smoke trail  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh, oh, oh everything changes  
  
This is your picture (it's in black and white)  
This is the family having a party  
There's a crack in the ceiling  
And there's an open door  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh, oh, oh everything changes

None But The Rain
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
We had our day but now it's over  
We had our song but now it's sung  
We had our stroll through summers clover  
But summer's gone now, our walkin's done  
  
So tell me gently who be your lover  
Who be your lover after I'm gone  
Will it be the moon that hears your sighin'  
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome song  
  
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom  
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair  
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning  
Will a rose be in your arms when I find you waitin' there  
  
None but the rain should cling to my bosom  
None but the moon should hear my lonesome sigh  
None but the wind should warn of your returning  
Fare thee well, my love, good-bye

It Takes Love
Styx
----------------
Written by Glen Burtnik, Bob Berger  
Lead Vocals by Dennis DeYoung  
  
sometimes it's hard to smile  
keep looking back  
searching for somebody  
who once was in your life  
baby let him go now  
there'll be something better ahead  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
we all have tears to cry  
but there comes a day  
to leave your tears behind you  
and give your heart  
someplace to start  
and if you find your way there  
there'll be someone waiting for you  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
like a river  
that flows  
to the sea  
  
don't wait  
like a river  
flowing down  
  
whoa...hey...ooh...ah...ooh  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
it takes love to make love  
never mind the broken heart baby  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you

Straighten Up And Fly Right
Nat King Cole
----------------
The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air  
The monkey thought that everything was on the square  
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back  
The monkey grabbed his neck and said "now listen, jack"  
  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
"ain't no use in jivin' "  
"what's the use in dabbin' "  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
  
The buzzard told the monkey "you're chokin' me"  
"release your hold and I'll set you free"  
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said  
"your story's fetchin' but it sounds like a lie"  
  
"straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
  
"straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."

Sponges
Arrogant Worms
----------------
Can't think of anything to sing about  
Not much out there to sing about  
The world's okay, the weather's fine  
No need to sing about that  
  
I'll sing about  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah!  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges absorb liquid then you squeeze them out yeah!  
  
There's lots of songs of peace  
Lots of songs of love  
Even songs about peaches and Valkyries  
No songs about  
  
Tuna fish, tuna fish, tuna fish, tuna fish  
They're real big and swim in oceans  
Come in cans like hockey pucks  
Tuna got their names 'cause they don't swim in pairs!  
  
Get it? Tuna. Are there two of those fish? Nah! Two-nah! Two-nah! It's funny!
Hee hee! No? I like tuna.  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah!  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges clean up dishes and sinks  
And countertops and baby's noses  
They suck up soap and when you squeeze them out they make  
Bubbles!  
Bubbles!  
Bubbles!  
  
Sponges

Nobody Sound Like Me
Xzibit
----------------
If you saw you walking on a street and a  
black man were comin' torward you  
what would you be feeling?  
  
Just one single black man? (yeah)  
I really don't fear that  
You know but if it's a group I'm talking from age thirt  
even thirteen even younger than  
thirteen. Yes I will walk across the street.  
  
Interviewer:  
Well let me ask you this...  
  
"I don't want niggas soundin' like me" -Ghostface Killah on 'Shark Niggas  
(Biters)'  
"I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?" (x2)  
  
Xzibit:  
Yo we gettiin' restless me and D.O.G.s  
Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message  
Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up  
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump  
I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump  
Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage  
It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC  
Bombin' first cause I feel it's better to give then receive  
You better believe  
Xzibit stays savage above the average  
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage  
But see all that irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate  
I dance with the devil for the hell of it  
Burning down your lavish lanndscape on digital tape  
Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
Montageone:  
Niggas we null and void I get swole like a keyloid  
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums  
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure  
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure  
So open up your door to me Cause if it's closed  
I'm a brakin' in with some pantyhose  
Over the mic  
So you don't know who I sound like  
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight  
It's not permitted by the right  
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco  
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a  
van  
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate  
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet  
For those with plans to clone me thee original  
It can't be done I'm digital (digital)  
  
Hook  
  
Xzibit:  
Yo who want to come see the hard rock?  
The non stop green block yo whole block receive speed knot  
You need not  
Get brave my bullets never graze  
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone  
So better get off on your own bitch  
Rollin' chrome shit tryin't to own shit  
I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer  
The author of my own destiny  
So I suggest you stop stressin' me  
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out  
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs  
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier  
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder  
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape  
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
"I don't want niggas soundin' like me. On no album"

Wasted
Mazzy Star
----------------
After I stuck my  
Hands into your ground  
And pulled out  
Somebody else's son  
I felt a little unfortunate  
A little mistaken  
I felt like I'd been wasted  
All day long  
All day long  
After I bent myself to my knees  
And raised my hands up  
Right above my head  
I felt a little, little  
A little bright patch  
I felt like I'd been wasted  
All day long  
All day long  
After I took my eyes  
From the west  
And brought myself back  
To my place  
I felt a little light for awhile  
A little light stone  
I felt like I'd been wasted  
All day long  
All day long

From the way she behaved  
But among the mourners  
And the frowners  
A cry were heard...(aaaargh!)  
ANY DOWNERS?  
ANY DOWNERS?  
ANY DOWNERS?  
ANY DOWNERS?  
No I ain't got any more  
No I ain't got any more  
No I ain't got any more  
No I ain't got any more  
Your downers are gone  
They was all you could get  
To ease your mind  
And your deep regret  
Over Charlie's mouth  
So enormous 'n wet  
Now all you got  
Is your TV set  
You turn it on  
And watch and dream  
A dream of love  
On the tiny screeen  
And what do you see  
As you lay in bed?  
It's a bald kinda girl  
With a pointed head  
Oh no...

Crown Of Worms
Megadeth
----------------
I am the author, dream up your pain  
Drink as did Bacchus, rebel just like Cain  
Lord of the city, I shall remain  
All pandemonium, I shall reign  
Sit in my fortress, up on my hill  
Drinking the wine, 'til I've had my fill  
Building up high, my castle walls  
Oh, to veil my splendid fall  
  
I present you, I present to you,  
I present you this crown of worms  
  
Surrounding myself with mysery  
Drawn curtains heavy of my history  
Exquisite I am, perfect unity  
On my left hand is false majesty  
I feign affection, refute the true story  
Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory  
I care for no one, my gospel is death  
For me the light's gone, only darkness is left  
  
I present you, I present to you,  
I present you this crown of worms  
  
As black in deed, as cold as stone  
A commandment of one, as proud as gold  
As neglected in spirit, as time is old  
As legion is numbers, as legend is told  
I am alone, with the agony of truth  
My power of will, my judgment and chain  
My end is knowledge and conscience of guilt,  
My final confusion hidden from me till I'm done

No Stopping Us
Jason Mraz
----------------
Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you?  
Would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you  
Would it take some hailing mary's so full of grace to get my sound to you  
Will you help me break it down and get on through  
  
Down to the other side  
Its easy of you only try  
Don't lie down on the job  
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us  
  
Should I address all my letters to the well to be  
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done  
Should I better not it so personally if all the good loving is never received  
Baby if it was me well I wouldn't think twice  
  
No not I  
See its easy if you only try  
So don't lie down on the job  
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us.  
  
I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station  
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created  
I promise to make it worth your while  
  
So c'mon try. Baby won't you try  
It's easy if you do not run  
I promise you you'll have your fun  
Because once we hit the top we've just begun  
  
There's no stopping us.

Drake

Intro:  
  
Would've came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I can't let it go  
Whether that's right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I would've came back  
But I would've came back for you  
Would've came back  
Would've came back...  
  
Verse 1:  
  
I talk, slicker, than a, pimp from Augusta  
Who just had his linen suit dry cleaned  
Bitches what's up witcha  
I hate callin' the women butches, but the bitches love it  
I took some sence and made a nickle of it  
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers  
With those lips that all that lipstick covers  
You're never too groen up to miss and hug her  
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubers  
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers  
This ain't the life that I'm used to  
Re-introduced to people I've been intoduced to  
Did you forget me?  
Or are you took scared to tell me that you met me and fear that I wont  
Remember  
I wish you could still accept me for me  
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad  
The simplistic beauty that all them southerners had  
I'm half way across the world with dozens of bags  
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd  
In one nigga, amazin' shit  
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit  
Ion drink every bottle I own  
I be agin' shit  
And I got them wedding ring flows that engaging shit  
Which one of y'all got fleets on your key chains  
The seats to these Heat games  
I think that you stare at yourself and you see things  
La familia, I've been inducted and instucted  
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with  
Fuck is up?  
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices  
23 and goin' through a mid-life crisis  
But tust me I still deliver like a mid-wife  
And no I'm not syin' I'm the nicest  
I just live life like it  
Uh, It a certain type of man to teach  
To be far from hood  
But to understand the streets  
I never threw away that paper with my grammy speech  
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach  
Yeah, You gotta own it if you want it  
Kisses her on the body  
She tells me live in the moment  
And baby I never forget none of that  
Girl I told you I was comin' back  
  
Chorus:  
  
Would've came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I can't let it go  
Whether that's right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I would've came back  
But I would've came back for you  
Would've came back  
Would've came back

She's Got You
Patsy Cline
----------------
I've got your picture  
That you gave to me  
And it's signed with love  
Just like it used to be  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got your picture  
She's got you  
  
I've got the records  
That we used to share  
And they still sound the same  
As when you were here  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got the records  
She's got you  
  
[Chorus]  
I've got your memory  
Or, has it got me  
I really don't know  
But I know, it won't let me be  
  
I've got your class ring  
That proves you cared  
And it still looks the same  
As when you gave it, dear  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got these little things  
She's got you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got your class ring  
That proves you cared  
And it still looks the same  
As when you gave it, dear  
The only thing different  
The only thing new  
I've got these little things  
She's got you

Josephina
Van Halen
----------------
Josephina, there's so much I want to know  
I've known you for all of mine  
But not all of yours  
You're not a stranger  
No, nothing could be further  
I look back and I wonder  
What you were like, long before  
Josephina, if I asked you, would you tell me?  
The fact from the fancy  
And the dreams in between  
Tell me a story  
All about yours truly  
Photographs from the past  
Imagine the mystery  
  
Didja get your head lost in a daydream?  
Cinderella, waiting for her charming  
Did ya break a heart, like little girls often do?  
Pigtails and painted toes  
All dressed up in your mother's clothes  
Can you shine the light?  
Ah, can you shine the light?  
Oh, please can you shine some light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
Josephina, would you lay down your defenses?  
So I can make sense of  
Those colors fading to grey  
It's not that you're hiding  
Something, I'd never imply  
Yesteryear I may be gone  
Can't say the same for today  
  
Yeah, Josephina!  
  
Ah, Josephina!  
  
How else am I to know, that all the while  
There was a mischievous look, behind that smile?  
It's hard to tell, when innocence comes and goes  
I'm sure that there were times, life could be unkind  
Without a shoulder to cry on  
Can you shine the light?  
Ah, can you shine the light?  
Yeah, please can you shine some light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)

Just One Way To Say I Love You
Perry Como
----------------
I love you, I love you, there's no other way  
Just one way to say "I love you"  
I love you, I love you, and, try as I may  
That's all I can say - "I love you"  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say "I love you"  
  
There's no other way  
Just one way to say "I love you"  
  
And, try as I may  
That's all I can say - "I love you"  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say "I love you"

Burn
Nine Inch Nails
----------------
This world rejects me  
This world threw me away  
This world never gave me a chance  
This world gonna have to pay  
  
Well I don't believe in your institutions  
I did what you wanted me to  
I'm like the cancer in your system  
I've got a little surprise for you  
  
Something inside of me  
Has opened up its eyes  
Why did you put it there?  
Did you not realize  
This thing inside of me  
It screams the loudest sound  
Sometimes I think I could  
  
Burn  
  
I look down from at where you're standing  
Flock of sheep out on display  
With all your lies bumped up around you  
I can take it all away  
  
Something inside of me  
Has opened up its eyes  
Why did you put it there?  
Did you not realize  
Something inside of me  
It screams the loudest sound  
Sometimes I think I could  
  
I'm gonna burn this whole world down  
  
I never was a part of you  
  
Burn  
  
I was a soldier  
I am corruption  
I am the agent  
Of your destruction  
I am perversion  
Sick with desire  
I am your future  
Swallowed up in fire

Nowhere With Love
Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
In a way, I really don't know much at all  
And if you say that I'm simple, you're on the ball  
On the ball to say that I'm going nowhere  
But I'm going nowhere with love  
  
They all say that I'm not impressive at best  
That's O. K., I've got nobody to impress  
My impression is they'd rather be elsewhere  
Oh, I'm staying nowhere with love  
  
Well, it's better to be happy in a cardboard shack  
Than to be alone in a castle  
All you get for your money is a heart attack  
I'd just as soon alleviate the hassle  
  
Every day, I watch the go-getters go by  
Even they say the ladder is much too high  
Why should I go high, I'm happy below there  
Right here in nowhere with love

Children Of The Revolution
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
Children of the revolution coming out to play  
Bombers ripped the night apart and blew the school away  
Some live on the south side and they overlook the water  
Some live on the north side and they're looking at the border  
And those children of the revolution see the soldiers come  
Smiling at the widows as they take away the sons  
Children of the revolution shot down with a brand new gun  
They're dropping down like flies and in their eyes  
The images of war are in their eyes  
They've seen it all before and know your lies  
Won't keep their bellies full  
In love and war there are no rules  
Children of the revolution getting off the boat  
To face the ignorance and prejudice that keep this land afloat  
Children of the revolution make a brand new start  
Running through the rubble of a thousand broken hearts and in their eyes  
All promises are broken in their eyes  
The words that can't be spoken and your lies  
Don't keep their bellies full  
In love and war there are no rules  
But in their eyes  
Murder comes by sea and from the skies  
It's shiny and it's quick to take their lives  
And if it's cruel, in love and war there are no rules  
Children of the revolution coming out to play  
Someone sells a gun and someone blows them all away  
Children of the revolution sold out by the banks  
Who swap the green upon the dollars for the green upon the tanks  
Children of the revolution shot down by a brand new gun  
Shot down by a brand new gun  
Shot down by a brand new gun  
Shot down by a brand new gun

Let Me Be Your Lover
Enrique Iglesias
----------------
I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol  
I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol  
We falling in love with party, friends and alcohol  
That's why I'm falling in love I'm falling in love  
With you tonight  
  
Spent my whole life waiting for a girl like you  
Baby tell me what I got to do  
We can leave this party, back to my room  
You could show me a thing or two  
  
'Cause I been spending all my money  
On these pretty girls and alcohol  
But honey they ain't got a thing on you  
  
You shook me once, you shook me twice  
Now take me to your paradise  
You know there's just one thing left to  
  
Let me show you I'm talking about  
  
If you let me be your lover  
I'd do anything for you  
I could rock you like no other  
Oh oh come on girl get loose  
  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
  
Baby shake that body, now turn around  
Slow motion for me now (oh yeah)  
Girl you got me going, now I'm going down  
Yeah you know what I talking about  
  
'Cause I been spending all my money  
On these pretty girls and alcohol  
But honey they ain't got a thing on you  
  
You shook me once, you shook me twice  
Now take me to your paradise  
You know there's just one thing left to  
  
Let me show you I'm talking about

Oh oh come on girl get loose  
  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
  
I'm the mailman I deliver  
Take her to dinner  
Conversate a little then I split her down the middle like Miam's river  
I like my women one up one down Kerry Kittles  
Here's a riddle  
What's the opposite of walk ? run  
What's the opposite of go ? come  
That means I hit it, you come  
Fe fi fo fun, tear the club up!  
All my sexy ladies that came to lose their minds  
Put you hands up high tear the club up!  
She ain't looking for me, she just looking for a really good time  
That's right! tear the club up!  
Let's drink that bottle and forget what we doing tonight  
Tear the club up!  
I ain't trying to be your lover for life just your lover tonight  
That's right  
  
If you let me be your lover  
I'd do anything for you  
I could rock you like no other  
Oh oh come on girl get loose  
  
If you let me be your lover  
I'd do anything for you  
I could rock you like no other  
Oh oh come on girl get loose

Crashed Into Love
Spandau Ballet
----------------
We stand alone  
Warmed by the light that reflects in your eyes  
I feel inside an emotional storm  
And a heart like a sky  
This moment takes to somewhere unknown  
And what I'm feeling is thrilled to the bone  
Been chasing rainbows all of my life  
Now I know that was wrong  
I've found the gold deep in my soul  
And I want to hang on  
Just one look of encouragement  
And what I have here is heaven sent  
And hit from above  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I'm feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide, this can't be denied  
And now it hits me, love overdrive  
I try to stand my ground but I can't contrive  
These are the days that we'll think that we dreamed  
For the rest of our lives  
This moment takes to somewhere unknown  
And what I'm feeling is thrilled to the bone  
And hit from above  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I'm feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide, this can't be denied  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I know that I was hit by surprise  
Between open eyes, emotions arise  
And now we're living the June of our lives  
In the heat of the day  
We're on the eve of experience now  
And nothing will take away  
Crashed into love  
Crashed into love  
Just one look of encouragement  
And what I have here is heaven sent  
And sent from above  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I'm feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide, this can't be denied  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I know that I was hit by surprise  
Between open eyes, emotions arise  
I just crashed into love

I Remember You
Eurythmics
----------------
Well there's a color picture  
In my mind.  
Of all the places  
That I've left behind.  
The broken windows  
Where the wind blows through  
Empty shells of houses  
That have turned to ruin.  
  
Oh, we were so young.  
We didn't realise  
Just what we'd done.  
Oh, we were too young.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I remember you.  
You were the back yard boy.  
Hiding in the wreckage  
Of broken dreams.  
Standing by the railway line.  
Standing.  
  
Oh, we were so young.  
We didn't realise  
Just what we'd done.  
Oh, we were too young.  
  
And all the sweetness  
Has been taken out of this place.  
So many memories  
Are knocked down or replaced.  
And I can't stand to see  
The shifting time  
Taking me further,  
Leaving you behind.  
  
[Chorus]

Last Man Standing
Bon Jovi
----------------
Come see a living, breathing spectacle  
Only seen right here  
It's your last chance in this lifetime  
The line forms to the rear  
You won't believe your eyes  
Your eyes will not believe you're ears  
Get your money out, get ready  
Step right up, yeah you, come here  
  
You ain't seen nothing like him  
the last one of the breed  
You better hold on to your honey  
Honeys, don't forget to breathe  
Enter at your own risk, mister  
It might change the way you think  
There's no dancers, there's no diamonds  
No this boy he don't lip-synch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here's the last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come and see, hear, feel, the real thing  
  
See those real live calloused fingers  
Wrapped around those guitar strings  
Kiss the lips where hurt has lingered  
It breaks the hart to hear him sing  
The songs were more than music  
They were pictures from the soul  
Se keep your pseudo-punk, hip-hop, pop-rock junk  
And your digital downloads  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take your seats now, folks. It's showtime  
Hey, Patrick - hit the lights  
There's something in the air  
There's magic in the night  
Now here's the band, they really play  
I'll count the first one in  
I don't know where it's gone  
Well all know where it's been  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come see, hear, feel, the real thing.

I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow
Alison Krauss
----------------
I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow  
Norman Blake  
I am a man of constant sorrow  
I've seen trouble all my day.  
I bid farewell to old Kentucky  
The place where I was born and raised.  
(The place where he was born and raised )  
For six long years I've been in trouble  
No pleasures here on earth I found  
For in this world I'm bound to ramble  
I have no friends to help me now.  
(chorus) He has no friends to help him now  
It's fare thee well my old true lover  
I never expect to see you again  
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad  
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.  
(chorus) Perhaps he'll die upon this train.  
You can bury me in some deep valley  
For many years where I may lay  
Then you may learn to love another  
While I am sleeping in my grave.  
(chorus) While he is sleeping in his grave.  
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger  
My face you'll never see no more.  
But there is one promise that is given  
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.  
(chorus) He'll meet you on God's golden shore.

Days Of The Week
Stone Temple Pilots
----------------
Monday, back from the dead  
I'm letting it go, back for another one  
  
Tuesday, shoot me in the head  
I'm takin' it back , takin' it back  
I'll take it back  
  
Wednesday, she's lookin' for a friend  
She'll get what she wants  
Can't seem to get enough  
  
Thursday, it's more than I can stand  
I'm holdin' her down, holdin' her down  
She's down again  
  
I gotta find a way to find her  
Where could she be?  
Four days of the week  
She thinks I'm the enemy  
  
One day, left me for dead  
Woke up on the floor, time for another one  
Two days, she's leavin' me again  
Can't take it no more  
Out through the open door  
Three days, she's found herself a friend  
She got what she wants  
Still never get enough  
Four days she's back with me again  
She's pullin' me down, pullin' me down  
I'm down again  
  
Monday's gone  
Tuesday's fadin'  
Wednesday's gone  
Thursday's all but wasted now

I Can't Forget
Patsy Cline
----------------
I can't forget you  
I've got these memories of you  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
Once we were happy  
We were so carefree and gay  
Then something happened  
And you went away  
  
I can't forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because I'll always love you  
  
Where are you darlin'  
Are you with someone new  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
I can't forget you  
I've got these memories of you  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
I can't forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because I'll always love you  
  
Where are you darlin'  
Are you with someone new  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you

Chances
Air Supply
----------------
There's a chance you will be there  
I'd like to know the truth  
I'll find it out somehow  
Chances aren't too strong  
A chance you will be there  
Please be there alone  
Help me speak of love  
Chances aren't enough  
Ones too good to miss  
Chances aren't too strong  
A chance is all there is  
  
There's a chance you will be there  
Wondering what to do  
How to play my role  
I'll leave it up to you  
If I disguise my smile  
It gives too much away  
What if we can't speak  
What then shall I say  
Don't you be too long  
Something has gone wrong  
The chances are all gone  
  
There's a chance you will be there  
Wondering what to do  
How to play my role  
I'll leave it up to you  
If I disguise my smile  
It gives too much away  
What if we can't speak  
What then shall I say  
Don't you be too long  
Something has gone wrong  
The chances are all gone

----------------
Mississippi Queen - you know what I mean  
Mississippi Queen - she taught me everything  
  
Way down around Vicksburg around Lousisiana way  
There's a cajun lady called the Mississippi Queen  
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine  
While the rest of those dudes where gettin' their kicks  
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was gettin mine  
  
Mississippi Queen - if you know what I mean  
Mississippi Queen - she taught me everything  
  
This lady she asked me if I would be her man  
You know that I told her I'd do what I can  
To keep her lookin pretty, buy her dresses that shine  
While the the rest of them dudes was makin their bread  
Buddy beg your pardon I was losing mine  
  
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine  
While the rest of those dudes where gettin there kicks  
Brother beg your pardon I was gettin mine

Cross-Eyed Mary
Iron Maiden
----------------
Who would be a poor man, a beggar man, a thief  
If he had a rich man in his hand  
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth  
If he could take it from the money man  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contract but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along  
A poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song  
A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong  
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, let the poor man get along  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contracts but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Cross-eyed Mary, oh Mary, oh cross-eyed mary

Rolling Stones

Well now meet me in the bottom,  
Bring me my running shoes.  
Yeah now, meet me in the bottom,  
Bring me my running shoes.  
When I come out the window,  
I'm gonna have time to lose.  
  
When you see me streakin' by,  
Please don't believe.  
When you see me streakin' by,  
Please don't believe.  
When you see me coming baby  
You know my life is at stake.  
  
Yeah now I hope you'll see me  
When I come streakin' by.  
Well I hope you'll see me,  
When I come streakin' by.  
She' got a bad old man, you know  
And I'm too young to die.

One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)
Chuck Berry
----------------
It's quarter to three and there's no one in the place except you and me  
So set 'em up Joe, I got a little story you ought to know  
We're drinkin' my friend on to the end of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
I got the routine, gonna drop another quarter in this machine  
Feelin' so bad, I got to have the music dreamy and sad  
I could tell you a lot but you have got to be true to your code  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
Joe you'd never know it but I'm a kind of poet  
And I got a lot of things to say  
But when I'm gloomy just listen to me until it's all talked away  
  
Well, that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close  
Thanks, thanks for the cheer, hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear  
The torch that I found must be drowned or soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
One more for the road

Glee

Hey baby won't you look my way  
I could be your new addiction  
Hey baby what you got to say  
All you're giving me is fiction  
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time

Standing In The Doorway
Chris Rea
----------------
There'll be no moon tonight  
And the stars won't light the sky  
There are women on the streets,  
But there's no loving in their eyes  
Feeling weary, tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now  
There'll be dancing flames  
Something special cooking slow  
Perfume heavy and all the lanterns turned down low  
Oh that lucky, oh that lucky man  
Who is standing in your doorway now  
I'm a wandering man  
You'll never tie me down  
Lifelong sailor, but how I wish I was homeward bound  
At this moment tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now

Keep On Moving
Bob Marley
----------------
Lord, I've got to keep on moving  
Lord, I've got to get on down  
Lord, I've got to keep on moving  
Where I can't be found  
Lord, they're coming after me  
  
I've been accused for the killin'  
Lord knows I didn't do  
For hangin' me, they are willin', yeah, yeah  
And that's why I've got to get on through  
Lord, they're coming after me (a-one more time)  
  
(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving  
Lord, I've got to get on down  
Lord, I've got to keep on moving  
Where I can't be found  
Lord, they're coming after me  
  
(Now, listen) I've got two boys and a woman  
They're just gonna suffer now  
Lord, forgive me for not goin' back  
But I'll be there anyhow  
I'll be there anyhow (one more time)  
  
(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving  
Lord, I've got to get on down  
Lord, I've got to keep on moving  
Where I can't be found  
Lord, they're coming after me  
  
Now, maybe someday I'll find a piece of land  
Somewhere not by near anyone  
Then I'll send for my love, love, love, love, sweet woman  
And my two grown up son  
My two grown up son (yeah, yeah)  
  
(I say now) Lord I've got to keep on moving

Pick Me Up On Your Way Down
Patsy Cline
----------------
Once my love was good enough  
True happiness we knew  
Then fame and fortune came your way  
And made a change in you  
You'll find your ladder of success  
Is not on solid ground  
And when it starts to tumble  
Pick me up on your way down  
Pick me up when dreams are shattered  
When false friends cannot be found  
For you know I'll still be waiting  
Pick me up on your way down  
You've hit the top, but it won't last  
There's just one way to go  
The world you've chosen is not real  
These things you'll come to know  
When folks say they don't know you  
And you've lost your final round  
When you find that you are lonely  
Pick me up on your way down  
Pick me up when dreams are shattered  
When false friends cannot be found  
For you know I'll still be waiting  
Pick me up on your way down

Fairytale Of New York
Pogues
----------------
It was Christmas Eve babe  
In the drunk tank  
An old man said to me, won't see another one  
And then he sang a song  
The Rare Old Mountain Dew  
I turned my face away  
And dreamed about you  
  
Got on a lucky one  
Came in eighteen to one  
I've got a feeling  
This year's for me and you  
So happy Christmas  
I love you baby  
I can see a better time  
When all our dreams come true  
  
They've got cars big as bars  
They've got rivers of gold  
But the wind goes right through you  
It's no place for the old  
When you first took my hand  
On a cold Christmas Eve  
You promised me  
Broadway was waiting for me  
  
You were handsome  
You were pretty  
Queen of New York City  
When the band finished playing  
They howled out for more  
Sinatra was swinging,  
All the drunks they were singing  
We kissed on a corner  
Then danced through the night  
  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Were singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
  
You're a bum  
You're a punk  
You're an old slut on junk  
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed  
You scumbag, you maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy Christmas your arse  
I pray God it's our last  
  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Still singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
  
I could have been someone  
Well so could anyone  
You took my dreams from me  
When I first found you  
I kept them with me babe  
I put them with my own  
Can't make it all alone  
I've built my dreams around you  
  
The boys of the NYPD choir  
Still singing "Galway Bay"  
And the bells are ringing out  
For Christmas day

The Taliban Can
Adam Sandler
----------------
Hey, alright, gather round,  
The Taliban is here!  
What bombs do you want?  
I got big bombs, little bombs,  
Cos I'm the Taliban,  
  
Who can take Osama,  
And hide him all around?  
Run away an' hide,  
When the bombs are fallin' down,  
The Taliban, (the Taliban)  
Yes the Taliban can, (the Taliban can)  
The Taliban can cos they mix a lotta nuts and screw the world real good,  
(screw the world real good)  
  
They tipple their own country,  
And keep their people down,  
And muster up a place to hide their damn Bid Laden crown,  
The Taliban, (the Taliban)  
Yes the Taliban can, (the Taliban can)  
The Taliban can cos they mix a lotta nuts and screw the world real good,  
The Taliban takes,  
The opium they make  
And turn it into their own riches,  
Oh, but they don't ever get their wishes,  
We're gonna bomb those sons of bitches!  
Just wait until tomorrow, (until tomorrow)  
We're gonna make 'em scream, (gonna make 'em scream)  
Drop all their bombs and destroy all of their dreams,  
You know that we can, (you know that we can)  
Yes, you know that we can, (yes, you know that we can)  
You know that we can destroy the Taliban and make the world real good,  
(make the world real good)  
You know that we can destroy the Taliban and make the world real good,  
(make the world real good)  
You know that we can destroy the Taliban and make the world real good,  
(make the world real good)

Personal Property
Def Leppard
----------------
She's a gold-plated lover  
Twenty-four carat cool  
She can walk on water  
She can walk in my room  
She's a one man woman  
and it's a one man race  
She's got a kiss like fire  
She burns the lips right off my face  
  
It's finder's keepers  
Loser's gonna weep  
She's personal, property  
Sealed 'n' stamped  
Money in the bank  
She's private  
For my eyes only  
  
[Chorus]  
She's personal property  
Personal property  
Personal service, personal touch  
Exclusively mine, thank you so much  
She's a heart stoppin', brain thuddin'  
Blood pumpin', knee tremblin'  
Spine crushin', tongue tyin'  
Personal property  
And she belongs to me  
  
She won't fall for nothin'  
She's much more than cute  
Don't mind why' window shoppin', that's all right  
But you ain't gonna taste  
My forbidden fruit  
  
Adios, au revoir,  
Wiedersehen, goodbye  
She's personal property  
Off limits, out of bounds  
Under lock 'n' key  
Confidential  
For my eyes only  
  
She's personal property  
Personal property  
Personal service, personal touch  
Exclusively mine, thank you so much  
She's a heart stoppin', brain thuddin'  
Blood pumpin', knee tremblin'  
Spine crushin', tongue tyin'  
  
She's mine, yeah  
  
Now I don't mind you guys checkin' her out  
You can whistle like a wolf  
Or you can mess around  
But let me tell you the secret  
Of the sweet life  
If you want to stay healthy, man  
Take my advice  
You better kit the road, Jack  
And don't come back!  
  
You could be king of the jungle  
Or you could swing in the rain  
But she don't need no monkey, not my babe  
Cause I'm her Tarzan and she's my Jane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And she's mine  
She belongs to me

Counting Train Cars
Widespread Panic
----------------
Remember watching children play  
Ring-around-the roses  
Tiny electrons circling in neutral ground  
So much gravity, in gravity  
  
Boys in bars, they stir their drinks  
Clockwise while the ladies dance  
Bodies and thoughts constantly in motion  
Oh, what a time to think of mom  
Counting train cars  
  
This is a place called paradise  
Make the fist that holds the paintbrush  
Take your open hand and roll the dice  
The trains will pass and the pups will rush  
  
Walk outside, stare down the sky  
Stars are fixed and so am I  
Grand illusions constantly in motion  
Oh what a time for gravity, counting train cars  
  
Another day in paradise  
Counting train cars  
Another day of gravity  
Counting train cars

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Andy Williams
----------------
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Oh, through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

I'm A Fake
Used
----------------
Small, simple, safe price.  
Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets.  
This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals.  
And I am not afraid to die.  
I'm not afraid to bleed, and fuck, and fight.  
I want the pain of payment.  
What's left, but a section of pigmy size cuts.  
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks.  
Would you be my little cut?  
Would you be my thousand fucks?  
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid.  
To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts.  
My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter.  
I'm cutting trying to picture your black broken heart.  
Love is not like anything.  
Especially a fucking knife.  
  
Look at me, you can tell.  
By the way I move and do my hair.  
Do you think that it's me?  
Or it's not me I don't even care.  
I'm alive, I smell  
I'm the cleanest I have ever been.  
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry  
Dry!  
  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).  
  
Do I drink? Do I date?  
I got perfect placements all my inks  
Satisfied in your eyes  
I'm the biggest fan I got right now  
I made sure I looked how I wanted to look  
The people around me, the people surround me  
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry  
Dry!  
  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).

It's A Great, Great Pleasure
Louis Jordan
----------------
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill  
  
Did you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones?  
Do you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones?  
Do you get a funny feelin' running up and down your bones?  
That's rheumatism  
  
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill  
  
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand?  
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand?  
Find you ain't got a nickel and your woman's got another man  
Bad deal

On My Own
Reba Mcentire
----------------
So many times I said it was forever  
Said our love would always be true  
Somethin' in my heart always knew  
I'd be lying there beside him  
  
On my own, On my own, On my own  
  
So many promises never should be spoken  
Now you know what loving him costs  
Now you're even talking divorce  
And you weren't even married  
  
On my own  
Once again I'm  
One more time by myself  
  
No one said it would be easy  
But it once was so easy  
Well I believe in love now here I stand  
You wonder why  
  
I'm on my own  
Why did it end this way  
On my own  
This wasn't how it was supposed to be  
On my own  
I wish that we could do it all again  
  
So many times I know I could have told you  
That losing him would cut like a knife  
He walked out and there went your life  
I don't want to live without him  
  
On my own  
This wasn't how it was supposed to end  
On my own  
I wish that we could do it all again  
On my own  
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself  
On my own  
You've got to find out where you belong again  
On my own  
You've got to learn how to be strong again  
On my own  
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself  
  
You've got to find out where you belong again  
Your heart is saying that it's time again  
And I know that you're gonna shine again

Hummin' To Myself
Linda Ronstadt
----------------
I'm a singer of love songs  
Songs that are happy and gay  
But how can I sing my love songs  
My lover's gone away  
  
I got the words  
I got the tune  
I've been rehearsing under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
I've got the place  
I've got the time  
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme  
  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Mmm mmm  
I guess it just had to be  
Mmm mmm  
  
Won't someone listen to me  
I got the words and I got the tune  
I'd like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Well I got the words and I got the tune  
And I'd like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Mmm, hummin' to myself  
Well I'm hummin' to myself  
I'm hummin' to myself

Ain't felt this good since I don't know when

Careful Man

Yeah I used to be a fighter but  
Now I am a wiser man

Now I am a tired man  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man

I Didn't Ask And She Didn't Say
Tim McGraw
----------------
Fogged in in Dallas on my way to L.A.  
Staring up at the screen , all flights were delayed  
When a voice behind me asked  
"Stranger how have you been?"  
I was caught off guard when I saw her face  
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace  
Yet somehow I managed to say "good to see you again"  
We caught up on old friends  
Caught up on old times  
But all through the small talk, it kept burning through my mind  
  
Does she think about the nights we spent on crystal lake  
Wrapped up in a blanket 'til the break of day  
So many times I wondered does she think of me that way  
I didn't ask and she didn't say  
  
Trading stories and pictures of kids  
Things we're gonna do and things never did  
'Til we were stranded in that moment not sure what to say  
Then she broke the silence with her little shy smile  
And she brought up the weather but all the while  
  
I wondered if she thinks about Jackson hole  
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow  
So many times I've wondered does she think of me that way  
  
I didn't ask and she didn't say  
We said our goodbyes, swore we'd stay in touch  
Then we went our separate ways knowing, knowing no one ever does  
  
But I couldn't help but wonder as I walked  
If thinks had turned out different where would we be today  
So many times I've wondered does she think of me that way  
I didn't ask and she didn't say  
No, I didn't ask and she didn't say

I'm Trying
Face To Face
----------------
Four year old at play  
Shot and killed today  
Never even had a chance  
Seventeen and high  
Threw away his life  
Has a gun to feel like he's a man  
Can't have it any other way  
  
Laying in the street  
Asking for a drink  
Doesn't have a place to live  
Pregnant at thirteen  
Still can hear the screams  
Something that she never will forget  
Can't have it any other way  
  
I'm trying to open my mind  
  
So you can keep your faith  
And I'll just walk away  
There's no reason for me to stay  
  
I'm trying to open my mind  
I'm trying to make up my mind

Iceman
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge  
Baby, this emptiness has already been judged  
I want to go out tonight, I want to find out what I got  
  
You're a strange part of me, you're a preacher's girl  
And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world  
Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot  
  
We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door  
And even the white angels of Eden with their flamin' swords  
Won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford  
  
Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard  
I got tombstones in my eyes and I'm running real hard  
My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away  
  
Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right outta my head  
But baby they didn't know that I was born dead  
I am the iceman, fighting for the right to live  
I say better than the glory roads of heaven better off riding  
Hellbound in the dirt, better than the bright lines of the freeway  
Better than the shadows of your daddy's church  
Better than the waiting, baby better off is the search

Handsome Devil
Smiths
----------------
All the streets are crammed with things  
Eager to be held  
I know what hands are for  
And I'd like to help myself  
You ask me the time  
But I sense something more  
And I would like to give  
What I think you're asking for  
You handsome devil  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say, I say, I say  
I crack the whip  
And you skip  
But you deserve it  
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it  
A boy in the bush  
Is worth two in the hand  
I think I can help you get through your exams  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Oh, let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say, I say, I say  
I crack the whip  
And you skip  
But you deserve it  
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it  
And when we're in your scholarly room  
Who will swallow whom ?  
When we're in your scholarly room  
Who will swallow whom ?  
You handsome devil  
Oh, let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say, I say, I say  
There's more to life than books, you know  
But not much more  
Oh, there's more to life than books, you know  
But not much more, not much more  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Oh, you handsome devil  
Ow

Burning Bridges
George Jones
----------------
Found some letters that you wrote me this mornin'  
And they told of a love we once knew  
Now they're gone, I burned them to ashes  
Don't want nothin' to remind me of you.  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's to late to turn back now  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you somehow.  
  
Sold the house we once planned together  
I said goodbye to the friends we once knew  
Then I moved to a faraway city  
Trying hard to forget about you.  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's to late to turn back now  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you somehow.  
  
All I want is to forget you somehow

How You Ever Gonna Know
Garth Brooks
----------------
That old wind that's whipping out there  
It's whistlin' your tune  
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt  
And footprints to the moon  
And that old star that you been wishin' on  
Is shinin' mighty bright  
But it's the fire inside your heart  
That's gonna lead you to the light  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to live there  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance  
You know failure isn't failure  
If a lesson from it's learned  
I guess love would not be love  
Without a risk of being burned  
Anything in life worth havin'  
Lord, it has its sacrifice  
But the gift that you're receiving  
Is worth more than a price  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to live there  
How you ever gonna know  
What you never knew  
How you ever gonna know  
If you're down here doin'  
What the good Lord put you here to do  
How you ever gonna know  
If you could have done it  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to fly  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never dare to try  
Listen not to the critics  
Who put their own dreams on the shelf  
If you want to get the truth to admit it  
You gotta find out for yourself  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to be there  
How you ever gonna know  
If you're the best  
How you ever gonna know  
What you believe in  
If you don't put it to the test  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold him  
How you ever gonna know  
What livin' means  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never chase the dreams  
How you ever gonna know  
Your potential  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance

I Need Your Love
Ellie Goulding
----------------
I need your love  
I need your time  
When everything's wrong  
You make it right  
I feel so high  
I come alive  
I need to be free with you tonight  
I need your love  
  
[Beat break]  
  
I need your love  
  
I take a deep breath everytime I pass your door  
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore  
And that's the reason you're in the dark  
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart  
And I feel so helpless here  
Watch my eyes are filled with fear  
Tell me do you feel the same  
Hold me in your arms again  
  
I need your love  
I need your time  
When everything's wrong  
You make it right  
I feel so high  
I come alive  
I need to be free with you tonight  
I need your love  
  
[Beat break]  
  
I need your love  
  
Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?  
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out  
What I mean to you, do I belong  
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong  
And I feel so helplessly  
Watch my eyes are filled with fear  
Tell me do you feel the same  
Hold me in your arms again  
  
I need your love  
I need your time  
When everything's wrong  
You make it right  
I feel so high  
I come alive  
I need to be free with you tonight  
I need your love  
  
[Beat break]  
  
I need your love  
  
All the years  
All the times  
You were never been to blame  
And now my eyes are open  
And now my heart is closing  
And all the tears  
All the lies  
All the waste  
I've been trying to make it change  
And now my eyes are open  
  
I need your love  
I need your time  
When everything's wrong  
You make it right  
I feel so high  
I come alive  
I need to be free  
  
[Beat break]

Apples Don't Fall Far From The Tree
Cher
----------------
Apples don'T fall far from the tree  
Writer Bob Stone  
  
When I was five  
I put on Mama's high heel shoes  
And paint my face  
And dance across the living room  
In Ruby's place  
Well the music was always playing  
Girls laugh while the men were sayin'  
  
Chorus:  
  
Apples don't fall far from the tree  
Hey, honey come sit on my knee  
Apples don't fall far from the tree  
And I remember Mama's tears  
When they said in a few years  
I'd be something to see  
  
At seventeen I had me a diamond  
And a string of pearls  
The men said they preffered me  
To the other girls  
They took me to the best places  
But I could read it on their faces  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Then when Mama died I made up my mind  
To get on a Greyhound, get out of this town  
And leave it all behind  
  
But life goes on  
A child of three smiles up at me  
While she plays  
The man I love has never heard of "Ruby's Place"  
When he holds her with affection  
And he uses that old expression  
  
[Chorus:]

Like a ball, daddy, and a chain.  
All right!

Amarillo
Neil Sedaka
----------------
When the day is dawning  
On a Texas Sunday morning,  
How I long to be there  
With Marie whos waitin for me there.  
Every lonely city  
Where I hang my hat,  
Aint as half as pretty  
As where my babys at.  
Is this the way to Amarillo?  
Every night I've been hugging my pillow  
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo  
And sweet Marie who waits for me.  
Show me the way to Amarillo  
I've been weepin like a willow  
Crying over Amarillo  
And sweet Marie who waits for me.  
Sha la la la la la la la  
And Marie who waits for me.  
There's a church bell ringing,  
Hear the sound of joy that it's singing  
For the sweet Maria  
And the guy whos comin to see her.  
Just beyond the highway  
Lies an open plain  
And it keeps me going  
Through the wind and rain.  
Is this the way to Amarillo?.............

It's Called A Heart
Depeche Mode
----------------
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
There's a sun shining in the sky  
But that's not the reason why I'm feeling warm inside  
The answer isn't classified- it's my heart  
From the moment I started  
I tried to be good about it  
Yes I've tried my best  
And more or less, I spoke from my heart  
There's a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
Hearts can never be owned  
Hearts only come on loan  
If I want it back  
I will take it back  
I'll take my heart  
But I will try my best  
And more or less  
I will speak from my heart  
Yes, I will speak from my heart  
Speak from my heart  
There's a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart

Catherine Wheels
Crowded House
----------------
No night to stay in  
Bad moon is rising again  
Dice rolls and you burn  
Come down I fear  
As that cold wheel turns  
I know what I know  
Sad Claude's been sleeping around  
To stroke the right nerve  
Whose needs do I serve  
As Catherine's wheel turns  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
  
Go kindly with him  
To his blind apparition  
His face creases up  
With age gone grey  
He'll back here one day  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Wheels on  
  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
  
She's gone  
Vanished in the night  
Broke off the logic of light  
He woke  
Tore the covers back  
Found he was empty inside  
  
So they were told  
When the moon would rise  
The best time to leave with your soul  
She's gone  
But towards the light  
Watching her whole life unfold  
Bruises come out dark  
  
So strong was his hold on her  
Regarded by some as his slave  
He spoke as in a stranger's tongue  
Despair us and drive you away, hey  
Bruises come out dark

In this rotten fuckin' place, hey hey  
Brains are all we ever get  
Why can't we have a change of pace  
  
Brains for dinner  
Brains for lunch  
Brains for breakfast  
Brains for brunch  
Brains at every single meal

Rape me, rape me again

I'll kiss your open sores  
Appreciate your concern  
You're gonna stink and burn  
  
Rape me, rape me my friend  
Rape me, rape me again  
I'm not the only one

Another Lover
Lloyd Cole
----------------
She's calling up her old boyfriends  
I'm falling in love with her again  
She's looking for a change of pace,she says  
I can see that old look on her face  
She says it takes an open mind  
I think she means an open relationship  
She says I can be so unkind  
All I said was...  
Don't think twice  
If you gotta go, Mary it's alright  
How much love can one man need?  
Don't change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But I'll find another...lover...  
She says it isn't wrong or right  
And me, I'm emotionally colourblind  
She's waking me at half past four  
I'm sleeping on the bathroom floor again  
She's fallen for his new age verse  
I'm holding back a level of consciousness  
I know it isn't wrong or right  
But all I said was...  
Don't think twice  
If you gotta go, Mary it's alright  
How much love can one man need?  
Don't change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But I'll find another...lover...  
I ran into an old girlfriend  
On the corner of Varrick and VanDam  
She said she had to change her address  
What a strange coincidence...

Sparks Might Fly
Mary Black
----------------
I cannot stop this child from touching me  
I see not fault in watching her bloom  
She knows where fire begins and where sparks might fly  
Yet I feel she may be consumed.  
She done turns on the be stage  
She shook hands when the shoe fit  
I wanna know how the land lies  
I'll let you in on a secret.  
I did not steal away when love rode by  
I did not let myself be unkind  
It's so heard to say where love meets lust  
I often think I'm losing my mind.  
I trade notes with the press league  
They send back their suggestions  
I wanna know where I come from  
But all I get are directions.  
Chorus  
I can't get started, can't get pain  
What's wrong?  
Big ideas, the find intentions  
They're all gone  
It takes two flagons of courage  
Pounds, shillings and pence  
You wind up going nowhere  
It doesn't make sense.  
I see my brother's face grow dark with care  
I spend my time avoiding his gaze  
I pray that God might make his dreams come true  
I'd give so much to feel he's been saved.  
A bright spark in the playground  
Dead loss as an anchor  
You don't call him a misfit  
He's just stuck for an answer.  
Chorus (2)

Falling Off
Aerosmith
----------------
I was a young man  
Whose Intentions were good  
Kept my hands in my pockets  
The way that I shouldI soon found out  
They got a mind of their own  
Beginning to thinkI had a heart  
Made of stoneI keep falling off  
I keep falling offI keep falling off  
I keep falling offI try to remember  
I try to forgetI?ll keep my promise  
Is that what I saidI had your number  
But I didn?t callI got no excuse  
I got my back to the wall  
I keep falling offI keep falling offI keep falling off  
I keep falling offMy eyes don't want to see  
My ears don't want to hear  
The things that make me feel  
That keep me so endeared to you  
It makes me thinkIs that the best that I can do  
It doesn't matter  
The time that I fallI'm up for the next one  
Like I'm ten feet tallI keep falling off  
I keep falling offI keep falling off  
I keep falling offI keep falling off  
I keep falling offI keep falling off  
I keep falling off

Perfect Day
Lou Reed
----------------
Just a perfect day  
Drink Sangria in the park  
And then later  
When it gets dark, we go home  
  
Just a perfect day  
Feed animals in the zoo  
Then later  
A movie, too, and then home  
  
Oh, it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Oh, such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
Just a perfect day  
Problems all left alone  
Weekenders on our own  
It's such fun  
  
Just a perfect day  
You made me forget myself  
I thought I was  
Someone else, someone good  
  
Oh, it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Oh, such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow

Sometimes
Erasure
----------------
It's not the way you lead me  
By the hand into the bedroom  
It's not the way you throw your clothes  
Upon the bathroom floor  
  
Been thinking about you  
I just couldn't wait to see  
Fling my arms around you  
As we fall in ecstasy  
  
Ooh sometimes  
The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah  
Ooh sometimes  
It's the broken heart that decides  
  
It's not the way that you caress me  
Toy with my affection  
It's not my sense of emptiness  
You fill with your desire  
  
Climb in bed beside me  
We can lock the world outside  
Touch me, satisfy me  
Warm your body next to mine  
  
Ooh sometimes  
The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah  
Ooh sometimes  
It's the broken heart that decides  
  
Ooh sometimes  
The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah  
Ooh sometimes  
It's the broken heart that decides

Beachcombing
Emmylou Harris
----------------
They say there's wreckage washing up all along the coast  
No one seems know too much, or got hit the most  
Nothing has been spoken, there's not alot to see  
But something has been broken, that's how feels to me  
  
We had a harmony, I never meant to small boats  
Lying out in the water, like a slick of oil  
Tide is running out to sea, under a darkening sky  
The night is falling down on me, and I'm a thinking that I should head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam  
Beachcomb  
  
Little wild kitten out hunting, see what he can get  
You're in a big city, that won't stop growing yet  
The sun is goin' down smokin', a flaming testiment  
Something has been broken, and it feels permenant.  
  
The little seabird flying, he knows were he wants to go  
Quess I ought to pack my stuff, and do the thing I know  
Turn around and head on back, along the old sea walls  
I felt somthing give and crack, and now I'm sorry that's all head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam  
Beachcomb

The Road
Jackson Browne
----------------
Highways and dance halls  
A good song takes you far  
Your write about the moon  
And you dream about the stars  
Blues in old motel rooms  
Girls in daddy's car  
You sing about the nights  
And you laugh about the scars  
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons  
You talk about the weather  
And you grin about the rooms  
Phone calls long distance  
To tell how you've been  
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins  
  
And when you stop to let em know  
You've got it down  
Its just another town along the road  
  
The ladies come to see you  
If your name still rings a bell  
They give you damn near nothin  
And they'll say they knew you well  
So you tell em you'll remember  
But they know its just a game  
And along the way their faces  
All begin to look the same  
And when you stop to let em know  
You got it down  
Its just another town along the road  
  
Well it isn't for the money  
And its only for a while  
You stalk about the rooms  
And you roll away the miles  
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars  
You're right about the moon  
But you're wrong about the stars  
And when you stop to let em know  
You got it down  
Its just another town along the way

O Holy Night
Ellie Goulding
----------------
[Verse 1]  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and ever pining  
Til He appeared and the spirit felt its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
  
[Verse 2]  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains He shall break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
O the world, the star is sweetly gleaming  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
  
[Outro]  
O the night when Christ was born  
When Christ was born  
When Christ was born

What Is Success
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
How does one decide  
That the methods he's using,  
They just don't jive  
To truly believe and keep trying  
Over and over again  
Living in hopes,  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
When will one change his mind  
And jump the fence  
For the dial a sign  
Its a sad thing, its a bad thing  
But so necessary  
Living in hopes,  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
Now what, what, (i don't know, can you tell me what)  
What is success?  
Is it do your own thing?  
Or to join the rest  
And if you truly believe it,  
And try over and over again  
Living in hopes  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
Oh, tell me what it is  
Sweet success  
  
Oh, tell me what it is  
Sweet success

Come To Poppa
Bob Seger
----------------
Words and music by earl randle and willie mitchell  
  
If the sun  
Ain't shinin bright  
And the moon the moon the moon  
Won't shine for you tonight  
If the stars in the sky gone away  
And you feel  
Feelin real low down today  
If life gets hard to understand  
And the whole thing is getting out of hand  
Come to poppa  
Come see your poppa  
  
If you need a pacifier  
Call me anytime  
I'll try to be your satisfier  
If you feel

Blazin' at the bit

If life gets hard to understand  
If your life is way out of hand  
Come to poppa  
Come see your poppa

Probably get it wrong just to get it right, girl  
Your probably gonna move, But I caught you now  
Now Ill just have to bow down now  
Cause I love the way you move me  
I love the way you move me  
  
I like most liquor, but I don't like gin  
Don't always like the skin I'm in  
Where were gonna go, I want to start again  
But I love the way you move me  
I love the way you move me  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
Just remember, I love the way you love me  
I love the way you move me  
  
I'm not all there, I'm a faithful sinner  
I might get lost, but Ill be home for dinner  
If God don't like me, he can hand me to hell  
But I love the way you love me girl  
I love the way you move me  
  
I pray to heaven to keep my place  
Till I look to the mirror and saw the Devils face  
And Id be a dog, for a tail to chase  
But I love the way you kiss me baby  
I love the way you talk to me  
I love the way you talk to me  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
The way you move me  
  
(Jam)  
  
Not coming home till the good days gone  
Working as hard, as the day is long  
Working men watch me, when I get home  
Cause I love the way you talk baby  
I love the way you move  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
Well remember  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
I love the way you love me girl.  
I love the way you move.

Mitchum Junction (Demo)
America

Railroad smoke sifting through the strong southern sky  
I always knew that one day I'd see you die  
Said the man at the junction  
To the boy in conjunction  
With the murder of a man  
With the murder of a man  
  
Railroad smoke sifting through the strong southern sky  
I always knew that one day I'd see you die  
Said the man at the junction  
To the boy in conjunction

With the murder of a man  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ...  
With the murder of a man

Dolly Parton

It's you that  
I run to  
Whenever I need to  
Darling, you console me  
When trouble surrounds me  
When bad times have found me  
Just reach out your arms and hold me  
Hold me  
Hold me  
Darling please take me  
In your arms of safety  
Reach out your arms  
And hold me  
Hold me  
When my feelings are showing  
When my tears are flowing  
Just reach out  
Reach out and hold me  
Hold me  
Hold me  
  
You know all of my needs  
You fill them completely  
You know  
That you control me  
I depend on  
Your lovin'  
Without you  
I'm nothin'  
So reach out  
Your arms and hold me  
Hold me  
Hold me  
  
Darling please take me  
In your arms of safety  
Reach out you arms  
And hold me  
Hold me  
When life is demanding  
When I need understanding  
Reach out  
Reach out and hold me  
Hold me  
Hold me

Love Is Everywhere
John Denver
----------------
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Open yourself to the first celebration  
Open your eyes to the joy and pain  
Life is the fruit of your own creation  
Every new birth is a soul regained  
  
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Drinking my life from a silver fountain  
Sweet water running to the cold salt sea  
Old man moon on a white-top mountain  
Sound of the wind singing dreams for me  
  
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Follow your heart like a flying stallion  
Race with the sun to the edge of night  
Form your truth like a gold medallion  
Dance in the circle of the love and the light  
  
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me

How Could I
Queensryche
----------------
There you were like a ghost from my early days, staring straight ahead at me.  
How could I ever guess, from that moment on, just how everything would change.  
How could I know?  
  
I recall something strange coming over me, somewhat at a loss for words.  
Id been around and had my share of what I thought my soul could bare, but
never seen what I saw in your eyes.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had and more.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had and more.  
  
Looking back at where weve been, the road ahead is so uncertain.  
We keep passing open windows forever.  
  
I've tried before Ill try again, I never know where were going.  
I only know that Ill be yours forever... Yours forever... Forever... Forever.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had.  
We gave it all we had.

Move On
Heart
----------------
Talk talk talk people are hammering in my brain  
Say so much nothing it's making me insane  
Telling out those rumors its gonna get hard to take  
Goes on and on what you gotta tolerate  
But never you mind, hey, don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus]  
Move on, let it ride  
Move on, leave it all behind  
Shine it on, shine your light  
Don't look back just leave it all behind I'll see you some other time  
Move on  
  
Them friends of many are really known by none  
Forever high school jealousy 101  
Make so much misery in this clich town  
They just love to get it up for the big let down  
But never you mind, hey don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See you on the flip side

Down In The Track
Doobie Brothers
----------------
I been workin' the whole day long  
On these railroad ties singin' a sad, sad song  
Down the track is a bad way to live  
The boss man's whip is all he's got to give  
And late at night in the twilight of the South  
They put you in a cell and let the bulldogs out  
The old cat down the way  
Well he's singin' out the blues  
'Cause he's got no one back home  
Oh, somebody sighed  
Next day comes they send you back out on the track  
All that sweat be drippin' down off your back  
Everybody's singin' a workin' man's song  
Hopin' they don't have to feel the whip on their bone  
The water boy slowly works his way around  
A bucket full of swamp water weighin' him down  
Old Squezer Walker just fell out on the ground  
And they're draggin' his body away  
Oh, my, my, my  
  
Well, there's talk around camp  
That there's gonna be a fight  
Old Razor Face and Willie Black  
The meanest dudes in sight  
One's got a razor and the other's got a knife  
But only one's gonna walk out alive  
  
Oh, baby, mama, get me out of here  
Can't stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me  
Believe to my soul that I gotta be free  
There's only one way that it's every gonna be  
That's when the angels come and take me away  
Well, now  
  
Oh, baby, mama, get me out of here  
Can't stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me  
Believe to my soul that I gotta be free  
There's only one way that it's every gonna be  
That's when the angels come and take me away  
Well, now

What Am I To You?
Norah Jones
----------------
What am I to you?  
Tell me darlin' true  
To me you are the sea  
Vast as you can be  
And deep the shade of blue  
  
When you're feelin' low  
To whom else do you go?  
I'd cry if you hurt  
I'd give you my last shirt  
Because I love you so  
  
Now if my sky should fall  
Would you even call?  
I've opened up my heart  
I never want to part  
I'm givin' you the ball  
  
When I look in your eyes  
I can feel the butterflies  
I'll love you when you're blue  
But tell me darlin' true  
What am I to you?  
  
If my sky should fall  
would you even call?  
I've opened up my heart  
I never want to part  
I'm givin' you the ball  
  
When I look in your eyes  
I can feel the butterflies  
Could you find a love in me?  
Would you carve me in a tree?  
Don't fill my heart with lies  
I will love you when you're blue  
But tell me darlin' true  
What am I to you?

House Of Wonders
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
So there you are you're sittin' there just kinda chillin'  
A richie boy you look a little bit like Dylan  
The 90210 bitch with the funny hair  
So I'm gonna change a few things around here and there  
Start with your eyes I pluck 'em both out your head  
And pull your balls out your sack and stick 'em there instead  
Then I snap off your toes and stick 'em in your nose  
And pull the hair out your head until your skull shows  
You're almost ready, gotta fix you for the show tonight  
But your lips, man, to me, they just don't look right  
They could be a little fatter, even more  
So fuckin' fat that your lip is draggin' on the floor  
Tie your tongue into a knot and stretch it out  
And tack a sign on it, tellin' what you're all about  
Set you up, 'cause now you're ready, so open up the door  
'cause at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Carnival thrills  
Carnival shows  
Carnival excites you  
Carnival kills  
(Ah, oh, ah, oh)  
Another freak show for the jugga-lugga-lo  
  
So there you are, come on in, chickie, wow! Ain't you a pretty?  
I think I'll start with the silicone that's in your titty  
I'll pull it out and put it in your forehead and cheek  
So now, you look like the elephant bitch freak  
Don't try to run, chickie-poo, I'm just gettin' started  
I'll beat your head in with a brick until you're half-retarded  
Remember that ugly girl you laughed at at the prom?  
Don't try to laugh now, bitch, you look like her mom  
You came to do the starin', but it's you they're starin' at  
I'll stuff you full of chili-cheese dogs to make you fat  
Then I'll stretch your fuckin' lips and stick 'em in your ear  
So all that evil shit you talk, only you can hear  
I shave you bald, and glue your titty on the top  
And then I spit on your nipple until you drop  
Hey! Almost ready? Jump steady, open the door  
Cause at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Oh, oh, oh my God [Repeat: x2]  
Oh my God"

Andrea Bocelli

Requiem  
  
Domine Jesu christe, rex gloriae,  
Libera animas omnium fidelium  
Defunctorum  
De poenis inferni  
Et de profundo lacu.  
Libera eas de ore leonis,  
Ne absorbeat eas tartarus,  
Ne cadant in obscurum,  
Sed signifer sanctus Michael  
Repraesentet eas in lucem sanctam.  
Quam olim Abrahae promisisti  
Et semini ejus.  
Hostias et preces tibi, Domine,  
Laudis offerimus.  
Tu suscipe pro animabus illis,  
Quarum hodie memoriam facimus  
Fac eas, Domine,  
De morte transire ad vitam.  
Quam olim Abrahae promisisti  
Et semini ejus.  
Libera animas omnium fidelium defunctorum  
De poenis iferni.

I just wanna be lost  
In a crowded room  
So I don't have to hear  
Your point of view  
You know I don't care  
About what you say  
And it's the way  
You say it, too  
  
So why did you come to me  
When you knew mat you didn't believe  
What did you expect to get from telling me  
You don't understand  
Anything or how I am

When you knew mat you didn't believe  
What did you expect to get from telling me  
You don't understand  
Anything or how I am

Within Temptation
----------------
You live your life  
You go day by day  
Like nothing can go wrong  
These skies are made  
They're changing the game  
You learn to play it hard  
  
And I know you wish for more  
And I know you try  
And I hope you realize  
You know the time is right  
  
The whole world is watching when you rise  
The whole world is beating for you right now  
Your whole life is flashing before your eyes  
It's all in this moment that changes all  
  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you fighting for?  
'Cause time's always slipping away  
The whole world is watching  
The whole world is watching  
You and you rise.  
  
You build your walls  
Then break them away  
'Cause that is what it takes  
You saved yourself  
You found who you are  
And that never goes away  
  
And I know you wish for more  
And I know you try  
And I hope you realize  
You know the time is right  
  
The whole world is watching when you rise  
The whole world is beating for you right now  
Your whole life is flashing before your eyes  
It's all in this moment that changes all

What are you fighting for?  
'Cause time's always slipping away  
The whole world is watching  
Yeah, the whole world is watching  
You and you rise  
  
Your sacrifice comes through your mind  
But nothing is wasted  
You made it now  
You rise again, breaking out  
He said that you're taken you paid the price  
  
The whole world is watching  
The whole world is watching  
The whole world is watching  
You and you rise  
  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you fighting for?  
'Cause time's always slipping away  
The whole world is watching  
Yeah, the whole world is watching  
You and you rise

And I'll pray for you  
It's no revolution  
But it's somethin' -  
Somethin' we can do!  
  
Pray all the day  
All the -  
All the day  
All the day  
  
Pray for me  
As you do for peace  
In a world of aggression  
Hear me!  
Must it make the news  
For us to show some affection  
  
Pray for me  
And I'll pray for you  
It's no revolution  
But it's somethin' -  
Somethin' we can do!  
  
Pray all the day  
All the -  
All the day  
All the -  
  
As it was in the beginning - so shall it be...  
Until next week!

It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels
Patsy Cline
----------------
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
(j. d. miller)  
As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing  
The tune about the wild side of life  
As I listen to the words you are saying  
It brings mem'ries when I was a trustful wife  
  
Chorus:  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong  
  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women  
It's not true that only you men feel the same  
From the start, 'most every heart that's ever broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame  
  
(chorus)

Hey Boy, What's Going On  
Thanks, I'm Doing Okay  
Don't Believe Rumours- Hey

If My Heart Could Only Talk
Billie Holiday
----------------
If my heart could only talk  
Heaven would be mine  
If my heart could only talk  
Life would be divine  
You would hear my song of love so tender  
It would thrill you until you willingly surrender  
  
If my heart could only talk  
Dreams would all come true  
'Neath the starlight I would walk  
Hand in hand with you  
I would have to seek your lips  
Thrill you to your fingertips  
If my heart could only talk  
  
If my heart could only talk  
Dreams would all come true  
'Neath the starlight I would walk  
Hand in hand with you  
I would have to seek your lips  
Thrill you to your fingertips  
If my heart could only talk

Alley-Gator
ZZ Top

Crawlin' 'cross the floor at the Holiday Inn motel  
I saw that girl that my swamp bone knew so well  
She crawled out of Texas flipped off to Baton Rouge  
She got that Gulf Coast sun tan that give a poor boy the blues  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, she'll make you 'fraid 'em  
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, yeah yeah yeah  
Crawlin' through the weeds with a Louisiana mean-toothed grin  
You can tell her that you love her, then you better tell her once again  
She might scratch your back and rub you with her rack  
You better watch out or stand back  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, she'll make you 'fraid 'em  
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, listen here  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, she'll make you 'fraid 'em  
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, listen here  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes

Devotion
Tracy Chapman
----------------
If I am right  
If I can be  
Constant and faithful  
You'll find me  
  
In my devotion  
In my devotion  
  
What if you find a fault  
Between my purpose and my deeds  
And deem me beyond salvation  
Judge me to be unworthy  
  
Of your devotion  
Of your devotion  
  
If this be obsession deliver me  
A passing infatuation deliver me  
A feeling lacking in purity deliver me  
A test of fidelity deliver me  
Deliver me  
Deliver me  
  
What if I should find  
You're no good for me  
What if I can't be strong enough  
What if I can't break free  
  
Of my devotion  
Of my devotion

Lover's Walk
Elvis Costello
----------------
I won't walk with my head bowed  
(Be on) Beyond caution where lovers walk  
My love walks where three's a crowd  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers walk, lovers scramble  
Beyond caution where the lovers walk  
Lovers step, shuffle and gamble  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers trip, lovers stumble  
Lovers dip, lovers fumble  
Lovers lip where love has crumbled  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lovers leap  
Lovers late, lovers wait  
Making promises that they can't keep  
Lovers link up arm and arm  
Lovers slink up, lovers charm  
Lovers drink up and come to harm  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Love is gone and it's no one's fault  
Love has stopped here, lovers halt  
Lovers don't walk, lovers run  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Now love's limping on a lover's crutch  
Looking for a hand with a personal touch  
Beyond caution where lovers walk

Korn

You fell away,  
What more can I say?  
The feelings evolved,  
I wont let it out,  
I can't replace  
Your screaming face  
Feeling the sickness inside  
  
Why won't you die?  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
So many words,  
Can't discribe my face  
This feelings evolved  
So soon to break out  
I can't relate  
To a happy state  
Feeling the blood run inside  
  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine,  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?  
Keep me down to what you think I should be  
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry  
Keep on trying I'm not dying so easily  
(I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? (I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? (I will not die)  
  
Why wont you die?  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why would you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine

Catch A Star
Men At Work
----------------
Experience babe, kickin' stones and cans  
Experience babe, cigarette-stained hands  
It's not too late, hear it in the wind  
It's not too late, feel passion creepin' in  
Intoxication, familiar smells of the hotels  
Infatuation, of knowing who you are  
  
You and I, you and I, you and I,  
Arrow through my heart,  
Catch a star.  
  
Isolation, rows and rows of cars  
Isolation, like Jupiter and Mars  
Staring faces, set in celluloid  
Welcome to the late show, starring Null and Void  
Complications, things get in the way  
Sweet sensation of knowing you are near and not too far  
  
You and I, you and I, you and I,  
Arrow through my heart  
Catch a star.  
  
You and I, you and I, you and I,  
Freeway through your heart  
Catch a star.  
  
Catch a star!

In These Crazy Times
Perry Como
----------------
( in these crazy times,  
How very sweet to know,  
Our love is like the love of long ago . . .  
In these crazy times,  
When life is wild and strange,  
Our feelings for each other never change . . . )  
Old things make way for new things,  
Yet we still cling to the true things,  
We will always be ruled by the heart!  
In these crazy times,  
When rockets fly in space,  
When quick success is all they're dreaming of,  
How blessed we are with our love!  
( old things make way for new things,  
Yet we still cling to the true things . . . )  
We will always be ruled by the heart!

When quick success is all they're dreaming of,  
How blessed we are with our love!

I play pool 'cause I'm no fool  
I play pool 'cause I'm cool  
I play pool after school  
I play pool all the time  
Cue in my left hand, beer in right  
I shout and drink all through the night  
That sloppy English does me just right  
I use that sloppy English all the time  
I hold my stick like I hold my dick  
Hustling beers from wetto that's the trick  
I use that sloppy English all the time

Blow into this paperbag,  
Go home, stop grinning at everyone.  
Blow into this paperbag,

On a blade of grass.

You're not under attack.  
  
Blow into this paperbag.  
Blow into this paperbag.

Reckless In The Booth
Ice Cube
----------------
[Hook:] x 2  
My juice is 900 proof,  
Only message to the youth  
I'm reckless in the booth  
  
I tell you no lies, please recognize  
I'll tear your monkey ass, to pieces and prize  
Niggas realize, it's not a disguise  
This hardcore shit will make your home girl strip  
Make you wanna take a sip of that red cup,  
Guess what, rest up, don't give a fuck  
Never did, small shit is irrelevant  
Heaven knows only live for the hell of it  
Know the elephant, hate anything celibate  
Don't really give a damn, what I tell a bitch  
Home going to the moon might see you soon  
Try to get that outlaw out the saloon  
Hear the click clack first then you hear the boom  
Get the fuck off my clap, mushroom  
Get out my face before I drop you  
Don't try to gamble, with Earl Campbell  
I scramble your eggs boy  
Replace your arms with your motherfucking legs boy  
They call me Dexter, David Hester, Clyde Drexler  
Mma, you's a wrestler  
  
[Hook:] x 2  
My juice is 900 proof,  
Only message to the youth  
I'm reckless in the booth  
  
I don't know why these suckers is fronting  
Like they ain't running and ducking  
With my team start that bucking and fucking  
That's what happen when you get something from nothing  
Any motherfuckers that wanna kick it done out in public  
No I'm g motherfucker and it's good to be home  
And I say sorry for the wait but I was burning the throne  
It's time to take shit, got no time for the hate bitch  
They talk shit, cause they ain't shit  
It's that rise of the ape shit,  
With no cesar, catch me rocking the pro  
Like I'm on that number 8 shit  
Niggas in the back wit their traps upon their hats  
And they guess they pack all black  
They'll take your racks on racks on racks nigga  
Thank god the gangster's back  
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap  
Oh my goodness, ong and I'm reckless in the booth  
And I ain't never been less than the truth, motherfucker!

Unwritten Law
----------------
I got a cocaine woman and she's cookin' up a pound of pills  
Another ride to the station and you know I'm gonna pay the bills, lord  
I gotta go see my baby  
Gotta run run run  
The only girl I loved  
It'll be the last one

She's hell on wheels

I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She don't complain when I say that I'm leavin'  
I'm in love  
  
I got a cyclone woman she's cookin' up a pound of thrills  
Another night she's away couldn't take cause you know it kills  
I missed her for six days  
Can't wait to see that fine-lookin' woman motherfuckin' lyin' next to me  
She's hell on wheels

Go Insane

Two kinds of people in this world  
Winners, losers  
  
I lost my power in this world  
Cause I did not use it  
  
So I go insane  
Like I always do  
  
And I call your name  
She's a lot like you  
  
Two kinds of trouble in this world  
Living, dying  
  
I lost my power in this world  
And the rumors are flying  
  
So I go insane  
Like I always do  
  
And I call your name  
She's a lot like you  
  
So I go insane  
Like I always do  
  
And I call your name  
She's a lot like you

Pictures Of Home
Deep Purple
----------------
Somebody's shouting  
Up at a mountain  
Only my own words return  
Nobody's out there  
It's a deception  
When will I ever learn?  
  
I'm alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And whispering pictures of home  
  
Wondering blindly  
How can they find me  
Maybe they don't even know  
My body is shaking  
Anticipating  
The call of the black footed crow  
  
I'm alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And taunting with pictures of home  
  
Here in this prison  
Of my own making  
Year after day I have grown  
Into a hero  
But there's no worship  
Where have they hidden my throne?  
  
I'm alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And screaming out pictures of home

Magical
Meat Loaf
----------------
Up in the shadows where the skeletons hide  
We all live in fear of the door and what's behind  
A door you dare not open, 'cause what you'll find  
A close encounter of the sexual kind  
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Batten down, baby, lock all doors  
You've got the love that I'm coming for  
Your hait's so straight, I can make it curl  
There's a little bit of bad in every good little girl  
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Is it really what you want,  
One more broken heart  
One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
When it happens, it'll be magical  
I'm not knocking, it here's to the magic  
When it happens, it'll be magical  
I'm not knocking it, here's to the magic  
  
Pull up the blankets, you won't hear a sound  
The pounding's like thunder when it shakes the ground  
You got a hunger only I can feed  
You try to fight it off but you're in too deep  
Love in the shadows, love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Is it really what you want,  
One more broken heart  
One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Heat, flame, embers- it can be magical  
Heat, flame, embers- smoking, smoking  
[Repeats 2x]  
  
Fire keeps burning up,  
Fire keeps burning

Big Bang Baby
Stone Temple Pilots
----------------
I got a picture of a photograph  
Of a wedding and a shell  
It's just burning itching memory  
I never kiss and tell  
  
So turn it up and burn it  
There's a hole in your head  
There's a hole in your head  
Where the birds can't sing along  
Does anybody know how the story really goes  
How the story really goes  
Or do we all just hum along  
  
Sell your soul and sign an autograph  
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash  
I wanna cry but I gotta laugh  
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh  
  
Spin me up, spin me, spin me out  
Station to station send me up and out  
Is this what life and love is all about  
I think I think so  
  
We used to see in color  
Now it's only black and white  
Yeah it's only black and white  
'Cause the world is color blind  
Does anybody know how the story really goes  
How the story really goes  
Or do we all just hum along  
  
Sell your soul and sign an autograph  
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash  
I wanna cry but I gotta laugh  
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh  
  
Nothing's for free  
Nothing's for free  
Take it away boys

Lipstick Vogue
Elvis Costello
----------------
Don't say you love me when it's just a rumor  
Don't say a word if there is any doubt  
Sometimes I think that love is just a tumor  
You've got to cut it out  
  
You say you're sorry for the things that you've done  
You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it  
I wouldn't worry, I had so much fun  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
Oh yeah  
  
Get to the slot machine, almost dead on arrival  
Just hit me one more time with that live wire  
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million  
You say I've got no feelings, this is a good way to kill them  
  
Select the control and then insert the token  
You want to throw me away but I'm not broken  
You've got a lot to say--well, I'm not joking  
There are some words they don't allow to be spoken  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue

I Don't Think You Know Me
The Monkees
----------------
If you think I want the life you choose to live  
I don't think I want the love you've got to give  
If you think my goals could be so trivial and small  
Then, I don't think you know me at all  
Born between the covers of your fashion books  
You think you can make it, girl, on just your looks  
But you could never bring me up  
Between us stands a wall  
No, I don't think you know me at all  
Believing in the promise painted in your smile  
I've chased what I was running from, girl, all my life  
I've known you a hundred times in memories I recall, but  
I don't think you know me at all  
I don't think you know me at all.

She's Madonna
Robbie Williams
----------------
Oh, Madonna, Madonna  
  
I don't miss you  
Just who you used to be  
And you don't ring true  
So please stop calling me  
  
Your I love yous  
Are ten a penny  
You're dropping clues  
Like you've got any  
You got to choose  
There's been so many  
  
I love you baby  
But face it she's Madonna  
No man on Earth  
Could say that he don't want her  
  
This look of love  
Says I'm leaving  
You're frozen now  
I've done the freezing  
I'm walking out  
Madonna's calling me  
  
She's got to be  
Obscene to be believed  
That's her routine  
Not what she means to me  
  
I found myself by circumstance  
Across a room where people dance  
And quite by chance she danced right next to me  
  
I love you baby  
But face it she's Madonna  
No man on earth would say that he don't want her  
It's me not you  
I've got to move on  
You're younger too  
But she's got her groove on  
I'm sorry love  
Madonna's calling me  
  
Madonna, Madonna  
  
I want to tell you a secret  
  
We're having drinks  
With Kate and Stella  
Gwyneth's here  
She's brought her fella  
But all I wanna do  
Is take Madonna home  
  
I love you baby  
But face it she's Madonna  
No man on earth  
Would say that he don't want her  
  
It's me not you  
I've got to move on  
You're younger too  
But she's got her groove on  
I'm sorry love  
Madonna's calling me

Looking For Love
Whitesnake
----------------
I'm tired of waiting  
An' closing my eyes  
I'm asking myself  
Why is it all my horizons  
Are so far away  
  
I look in the mirror  
Don't like what I see  
In my reflection  
A stranger is staring at me  
Looking for love  
  
The love of a woman  
The needs of a man  
I try so hard to believe  
But I don't understand  
The search goes on  
  
But over the mountains  
Across the sea  
I know love is waiting  
I hear it calling to me  
Calling my name  
  
I'm looking for love all around me  
Looking for love to surround me  
The love that I need  
To rescue the state of my heart  
  
Alone again, It's always the same  
I've just been marking my time  
Since the day I was born  
With no one to blame  
  
The candle is burning  
It's way down low  
I just need someone  
To show me the way to go  
Which way to go.  
  
I'm looking for love all around me  
Looking for love to surround me  
The love that I need  
To rescue the state of my heart  
  
I'm looking for love  
An' finding only heartache  
Looking for love  
An' finding only heartache  
I'm looking for love to rely on  
Looking for love, a shoulder to cry on  
I'm looking for love  
To rescue the state of my heart.

The Return Of Sathington Willoughby
Primus
----------------
Fellow colleges, distinguished members of the press, ladies  
And gentlemen:  
  
I would like to take this opportunity to personally and humbly thank  
Each and every one of you for joining us at this particular event.  
  
It is my hope that we can utilize this meeting of the minds to  
Successfully convey the essence of our platform to you, a grand and  
Noble audience.  
  
As I look out among the faces, I reflect, taking console in the words  
Of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said, we have nothing to fear but  
Fear itself.  
  
Paranoia is a disease unto itself, and may I add, the person standing  
Next to you, may not be who they appear to be, so take precaution.  
  
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, this is true any a young person  
Has fallen prey, to the substances that alter the perspective of any  
Right thinking individual.  
  
The problem with the youth today is, because of their inexperience  
With the world, they cannot attempt to grasp the ideals, set forth by  
Myself and those who preceded me.  
  
But, as history has shown, they will come around, and embrace our  
Philosophies and become model citizens in their own right, God bless  
This great nation.

Let's Roll
Yelawolf
----------------
[Chorus]  
Yeah, I'm throwed off  
Ain't about the money I'ma blow it off  
I made my own lane, let's roll, let's roll  
Yeah, I'm going off  
Ain't got a whole lot but I'ma show it off  
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll  
  
Yeah, now let me welcome you to my small town  
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around  
How I was raised, eight oh eight drums quaking, they shake that box, eighty
eight  
Yeah and the dope boys hotter than hells gate, but I, still in the shade  
With a fold out chair, a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate  
A-L-A, B-A-M-A I'm off I might pee in the lake  
I might go to Talladega and see me a race  
And bring me case, yeah I'm bringing a case, I'm gettin' throwed off  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm all the way throwed off  
Z-seventy one take the bow off  
Dipped in mossy oak, with a mullet Mohawk  
Yeah, with a bright orange hat, and a bag underneath that Chevy seat  
Yeah buddy, might go off, split you like a bowling ball  
Split you in my overalls  
Yeah home of the gumbo, got a couple folks that'd do it to you for hundo'  
And when them elephant feet rumble  
That Dixie cups gonna fall off the console  
You don't wanna have a convo' and not understand that 'Bama slanguage  
Like hollerin' ain't it, but I come to paint it, so it won't be throwed off?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm just a kid that rocks  
I'm just a boy with a dream  
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks  
Used to keep a twenty two in a shoebox  
Now I bang Beretta  
She's 22 and I keep her in a tube top  
White trash and all, take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off  
Like how the fuck did I get a catalog with more hits than a fucking jackhammer
dog  
Cause I planned it all, Crimson tide standing tall  
Shit, I'm another lit cannon ball  
Fuck around and I'm going off and I'm getting throwed off  
  
[Chorus]

Satisfy My Soul
Bob Marley
----------------
Oh, please don't you rock my boat (don't rock my boat)  
Cause I don't want my boat to be rockin' (don't rock my boat)  
Oh, please don't you rock my boat (don't rock my boat)  
Cause I don't want my boat to be rockin' (don't rock my boat)  
  
I'm telling you that, oh, oh-oh,  
I like it, like it this (I like it like this, I like it like this)  
So keep it steady, like this. (I like it like this)  
And you should know, you should know by now,

(Satisfy my soul) You satisfy my soul (satisfy my soul)  
You satisfy my soul (satisfy my soul).  
Every little action (satisfy my soul),  
There's a reaction (satisfy my soul).  
Oh, can't you see what you've done for me, oh, yeah!  
I am happy inside all - all of the time.  
  
When we (bend) bend a new corner,  
I feel like a (sweep) sweepstake winner.  
When I meet you around the corner (round the corner),  
You make me feel like a sweepstake winner (a sweep, a sweepstake winner).

When I meet you around the corner,  
Oh, I said, "Baby, never let me be a loner",  
And then you hold me tight, you make me feel all right.  
Yes, when you hold me tight, you made me feel all right.  
  
Satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul:  
That's all I want you to do, that's all I'll take from you,  
Satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul.

Devotion
Ellie Goulding
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Open up and let me in  
Show the bruises on your skin  
Let the fires all burn out  
I can hear the silent shout in you  
Let it go don't be so scared  
Find the love you lost again  
Let the chaos disappear  
Don't you know I'm always here for you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you  
I'm the one who drives to you at night  
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper  
I think our little hearts will be alright  
Cause this is devotion  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tell me what you dream about  
I lose you in my sleep, somehow  
Let the chaos disappear  
Don't you know I'm always there for you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you  
I'm the one who drives to you at night  
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper  
I think our little hearts will be alright  
Cause this is devotion  
  
[Bridge]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you  
I'm the one who drives to you at night  
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper  
I think our little hearts will be alright  
Cause this is devotion

Smile
Hanson
----------------
Well this feeling that you're feeling  
Is something I know you've felt before  
When I see you I want to hold you  
'Til the end of time and a little bit more  
  
And I'm not gonna let it go  
You've got to let your feelings show  
  
So smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
  
Well this feeling I've been feeling  
Well I can feel it right now from my head to the floor  
When I see you I want to love you  
'Til the end of time and a little bit more  
  
And I'm not gonna let it go  
You've got to let your feelings show  
So smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
  
I got my joy all broken into  
But if anyone can heal me baby it's you  
Won't you come and hold my hand  
This world has taken me as far as it can without your  
  
Smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
If you'll just smile, if you'll just smile

Living Inside Myself
Gino Vannelli
----------------
In my life  
I've felt so self assured  
But suddenly it's all changed  
She's a cloud, that hangs above my world  
And I find myself wond'ring in the rain  
And now I can't go on  
'Cause I am lost  
Living inside myself  
Living inside this shell  
Living outside your love  
I am lost, somewhere inside my own dreams  
Afraid of what life really means  
Living without your love  
I need a guiding light  
To shine on my darkest days  
I was young, and time was on my side  
But like a fool I let it slip away  
And now those days are gone  
And I am lost  
Living inside myself  
Living inside this shell  
Living outside your love  
I am lost, somewhere inside my own dreams  
Afraid of what life really means  
Living without your love  
In my life  
I've felt so self-assured  
But oh how all the seasons change  
And now I'm not that strong  
  
'Cause I am lost  
Living inside myself  
Living inside this hell  
Living outside your love  
I am lost, somewhere inside my own dreams  
Afraid of what life really means  
Living without your love  
I am lost  
Living inside myself

Don't You Remember
Adele
----------------
When will I see you again?  
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said  
No final kiss to seal anything  
I had no idea of the state we were in  
  
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
When was the last time you thought of me?  
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?  
I often think about where I went wrong  
The more I do, the less I know  
  
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe  
I kept my distance so you would be free,  
In hope that you find the missing piece  
To bring you back to me  
  
Why don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before  
Baby please remember me once more  
When will I see you again?

Only You Can Rock Me
Ufo
----------------
Who's taking time out, we'll take a shine out  
We're the boys we got nothing to lose  
I've had enough now of school and stuff now  
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Come on back now do it again  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
  
Come on the street now on every corner  
Breaking out and we're doing what we want to  
Just like a jewel shines in the night  
She burns so hot out under the street light  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We are here and there's no end  
We keep on coming again  
We are here and there's no end  
We just keep coming again  
  
Who's taking time out, we take a shine out  
We're the boys we got nothing to lose  
I've had enough now of school  
  
And stuff now  
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Come on back now, do it again  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We are here and there's no end  
We'll keep on coming again  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We are here and there's no end  
We'll keep on coming again

Fated, Faithful, Fatal
Marilyn Manson
----------------
[Verse:]  
I don't know if I can open up  
I've been opened enough  
I don't know if I can open up  
I'm not a birthday present  
I'm aggressive regressive  
The past is over  
And passive scenes so pathetic  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't know if I can open up  
I been opened too much  
Double cross glossed over in my path-os  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Bridge:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
And I'm ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
And I'm ready to meet my maker  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise every occasion

Cattle Call
Leann Rimes
----------------
(tex owens)  
  
Leann:  
(yodeling)  
The cattle are prowlin',  
The coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the doggies roam  
Where spurs are a jinglin'  
And the cowboy is singing  
His lonesome cattle call  
(yodeling)  
  
He rides in the sun  
'til his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
(yodeling)  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Eddy:  
For hours he would ride  
On the range far and wide  
When the night wind blows up and slow  
His heart is a feather  
In all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call  
(yodeling)  
  
He's browned as a fairy  
From ridin' the prairie  
And he sings with an western drawl  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Leann and eddy:  
(yodeling)

Young At Heart
Michael Buble
----------------
Fairy tales can come true  
It can happen to you when you're young at heart  
For it's hard, you will find  
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart  
  
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes  
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams  
And life gets more exciting with each passing day  
And love is either in your heart or on it's way  
  
Don't you know that it's worth  
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart  
For as rich as you are  
It's much better by far to be young at heart  
  
And if you should survive to a hundred and five  
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive  
And here is the best part, you have a head start  
If you are among the very young at heart  
  
And if you should survive to a hundred and five  
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive  
And here is the best part, you have a head start  
If you are among the very young at heart

One Of The Survivors
Kinks
----------------
See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike  
Riding along the highway,  
Rock and roll songs from the nineteen-fifties  
Buzzing around in his brain.  
Johnny Thunder he's one of the original bebop generation  
And he's got no time for complicated music  
Or too much sophistication.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The motorbike riders.  
You ought to see Johnny Thunder  
Riding down the highway  
One of the rock and roll survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain.  
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
And Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He plays Hound Dog, Oh Boy,  
And Great Balls of Fire  
And Boppin' At The High School Hop.  
And he's got no time for phonies or posers  
Cause they don't know how to reel and rock.  
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo,  
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes,  
The Hollywood Argyles, Danny and The Juniors,  
Dion and The Belmonts, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The boppers and the jivers,  
Yeah and he rocks all day.  
Johnny and The Hurricanes, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
Got my freedom riding along the freeway.  
I ride a hundred miles an hour  
But I don't mess up my D.A.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
  
Feel those vibrations flow in my brain.  
Got my freedom riding down the highway,  
Keeps me sane, feel alive,  
I'm one of the survivors.  
  
Feel all right.  
First gear, second gear,  
Third gear, fourth gear, all right.  
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight,  
And his sideburns are turning grey.  
But he still likes to bebop, boogie and jive  
To his worn out seventy-eights.  
Johnny Thunder.  
He's alright.  
He's one of the survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain,  
Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes.

There's Too Much Blue In Missing You
Modern Talking
----------------
Like the leaves falling off a tree  
I feel your love is dying for me  
You tell me it's not the end  
Where is the love that you forsake  
You forsake, you forsake  
  
There's too much blue in missing you  
I believe I was a fool  
Before you say goodbey  
Oh, give us one more try  
Yet, I can't forget all the love we had  
There's too much blue in missing you  
Oh believe my heart is true  
Your love slipping away, a little bit every day  
Throw it away, it's such an easy way  
  
Look at me I'm the lucky one  
Without feelings you can't be strong  
Though I call you in the night  
To hear your voice, Feel you deep inside  
Deep Inside, Deep Inside

Jezebel
Depeche Mode
----------------
They call you Jezebel  
Whenever we walk in  
You're going straight to hell  
For wanted acts of sin - they say,  
And that I'll have to pay  
But I need you just this way  
  
They call you Jezebel  
For what you like to wear  
You're morally unwell  
They say you never care for me  
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key  
  
Open their eyes to the beauty  
Open their hearts to the fun  
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone  
  
They call you Jezebel  
Whenever men walk by  
They say that they can tell  
The longing in your eyes is real  
And how you really feel  
But they can't see your appeal  
  
Jezebel

The Happy Elf
Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
Seven days a week  
Ev'ry week of the month  
And ev'ry month of the year  
He's got us making presents  
And I'm happy  
  
Ev'ry girl and boy  
Gets their own kind of toy  
We like to fill 'em with joy  
We're workin' over time  
To make 'em happy  
  
Then on Christmas eve  
We jump on big red's sleigh  
We don't miss a chimney  
On our jolly way  
  
We won't stop until  
Every kid gets a fill  
Of Santa's brand of good will  
The thrill of spilling cheer  
Just makes us happy  
  
So, if you've been good yourself  
You might see the happy elf  
Stop by your house and make  
You very happy  
  
The happy elf  
I'm the happy elf  
I'm the happy elf and I just might stop on by  
The happy elf  
I'm the happy elf  
I'm the happy elf and I just might stop on by  
I'm Santa's spy!

Feeling Single, Seeing Double
George Jones
----------------
Well, I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin' single but seein' double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night  
  
I came home from work this mornin'  
My little womans was a-feelin' low  
She told me what was on her mind  
And she told me where I could go  
  
Well, I didn't go where she told to to  
'Cause the water was cold in the lake  
There's something fishy 'bout this whole deal  
I'm gonna see where I made a mistake  
  
Well, I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin' single but seein' double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night  
  
Well, when I opened the door this mornin'  
Like me the sun was high  
I started walkin' the long way home  
Just to think of an alibi  
  
Well, I couldn't think of a doggon thing  
That I hadn't already said  
Guess I better play it by ear  
For I'm already dead  
  
Well, I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin' single but seein' double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night

Loved
Kim Wilde
----------------
Take all your goodness and shiness away  
I'll tell you the things I've been longing to say  
I'll break it to you just so you understand  
The force and control that you hold in your hands  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isn't always the same  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
(Oh you are loved)  
  
Live for the moment according to you  
And so when the time comes you know what to do  
Trust me, I'm giving no secret away  
I'm drowning in you but I want it that way  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isn't always the same  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
(Ooh you are loved)  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
(Ooh you are loved)  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
Rise to my world, fly to my arms  
I love you  
I'll make it for good, I'll make it forever  
you know you are loved  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Love isn't always the same  
You are loved  
Ooh you are loved  
  
(Loved you are)  
(Loved you are)  
(Loved you are loved)  
Ooh you are loved  
  
(Loved you are)  
(Loved you are)  
(Loved you are loved)  
Ooh you are loved  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
Ooh you are loved  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
(You are the only one I love)  
  
You are loved  
(Loved you are)  
You are loved

You are loved  
You I love

Just Another Piece Of Paper
Glen Campbell
----------------
It looked like any other piece of paper,  
But I thought there was love between the lines,  
But it was  
  
Just another piece of paper  
And it really didn't mean one little thing  
To you from the very start  
Just another piece of paper  
Now I got another piece of paper  
Your lawyer, he sent it in the mail today  
It looks like any other piece of paper  
But it says that you have gone away to stay  
And it is  
  
Just another piece of paper  
Blowing in an empty wind  
That slows into my heart  
Just another piece of paper  
Tearing us apart  
And it is

Silly, Silly Fool
Dusty Springfield
----------------
Such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
Oh, I, just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
  
Hey, I should have never fallen  
Back in love with you  
Knowin' how you get a pleasure  
Breaking my poor heart in two  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said  
"I'm your woman, you're my man"  
Now I really need you  
And I sit here a loser again  
  
I guess I'm just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh I  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, fool am I, mmm  
  
I should have never trusted  
In my heart to lead the way  
Now my mind is all busted  
That's a fool's price to pay  
  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said you'd never, never go away  
I should have never listened  
To anything you had to say  
  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh  
Such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh  
Silly, dilly

Beneath The Cross Of Jesus
Religious Music
----------------
Beneath the cross of Jesus  
I fain would take my stand  
The shadow of a mighty rock  
Within a weary land.  
A home within the wilderness,  
A rest upon the way,  
From the burning of the noontide heat,  
And the burden of the day.  
  
Upon that cross of Jesus  
Mine eye at times can see  
The very dying form of One  
Who suffered there for me.  
And from my stricken  
Heart with tears,  
Two wonders I confess,  
The wonders of redeeming love  
And my unworthiness.  
  
I take, O cross, thy shadow  
For my abiding place.  
I ask no other sunshine than  
The sunshine of His face.  
Content to let the world go by,  
To know no gain nor loss.  
My sinful self my only shame,  
My glory all the cross.

With this guitar in hand

To keep rock and roll alive  
...Keep it alive

Shake it, shake it, baby, 'cause it feels so right  
Motivate your body, gonna cure your soul  
Keep on rockin' 'til I lose control

Bo Diddley
Bob Seger
----------------
Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard  
Mama gonna buy you a mockingbird?  
If that mockingbird don't sing  
She gonna buy you a diamond ring  
If that diamond ring don't shine  
Baby gonna take it to a private eye  
If that private eye can't see  
He gonna have to come and talk to me  
  
Said, hey Bo Diddley  
Hey now, Bo Diddley  
Hey Bo Diddley  
  
I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire  
Use a cobra snake for a necktie  
Got a brand new house on the roadside child  
Made out of rattlesnake hide  
Brand new chimney on top  
Made out of human skulls  
Come and take a little walk with me, Arlene  
Tell me, who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
  
Arlene took me by my hand  
Said, "Cool it, Robert, you know you're my man."  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
  
Night was dark, the sky was blue  
Down the alley we was swingin' through  
  
Lord, I heard just what I seen  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?

Deer Dance
System Of A Down
----------------
Circumventing circuses,  
Lamenting in protest,  
To visible police,  
Presence sponsored fear,  
  
Battalions of riot police,  
With rubber bullet kisses,  
Baton courtesy,  
Service with a smile  
  
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America,  
With its tired, poor, avenging disgrace,  
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality,  
Of plastic existence.  
  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around,  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around.  
  
A rush of words,  
Pleading to disperse,  
Upon your naked walls, alive,  
A political call,  
The fall guy accord,  
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train,  
  
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America,  
With its tired, poor, avenging disgrace,  
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality,  
Of plastic existence.  
  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around,  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around.  
  
Push them around,  
A deer dance, invitation to peace,  
War staring you in the face, dressed in black.  
With a helmet, fierce,  
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents,  
For the disproportioned malcontents  
  
The little boy smiled  
It'll all be well,  
The little boy smiled  
It'll all be well  
  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around,  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around.  
Pushing little children,  
With their fully automatics,  
They like to push the weak around,  
Push the weak around,  
Push the weak around,  
Push the weak around,  
They like to push the weak around.

Bill Bailey
Michael Buble
----------------
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?  
She moans the whole night long.  
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent  
I know that I've done you wrong.  
  
I remember that rainy evenin'  
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb  
I know that I'm to blame, well ain't that a shame,  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home.  
  
Won't you come home Bill Bailey, won't you come home?  
She moans the whole day long.  
I'm gonna do the cookin' honey, I'm gonna pay the rent  
I know that I've done you wrong.  
Do you remember that rainy evenin'  
That I drove you out, with nothin but a fine tooth comb?  
I know I'm to blame, well ain't that a shame  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home.

Even A Fool Would Let Go
Dolly Parton
----------------
It's funny how love goes  
'Cause I know this could never work out  
But honey, how love grows  
Even though there's no reason to doubt  
This can never be  
You keep saying it's wrong  
Neither one of us is free  
Still I want to hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go  
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying  
Even a child would say no  
When he knows that he'll end up crying  
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you  
Even a fool would let go  
  
Love has no reason  
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme  
My love has no season  
I just know that it's there all the time  
Maybe just you and me  
I can't believe that it's wrong  
Thinking about you and me  
Just makes me want to hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go  
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying  
Even a child would say no  
When he knows that he'll end up crying  
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you  
Even a fool would let go  
  
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you  
When even a fool would let go

How We Do This
Demi Lovato
----------------
I've been stopping at green lights,  
Got lost on my way home,  
Sleep walking at night,  
I put my shirt on inside out,  
  
Umbrella in the sun,  
My head up in the clouds,  
My friends just laugh at me,  
There's only one thing it could be  
  
I've come down with love  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
I can't get enough,  
I wont break this fever,  
I need her I'm bit by the bug  
  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love  
  
You got me trippin' on my feet,  
My mind starts racing  
And my heart forgets beat,  
When you start to walk my way  
  
I forget where I am,  
Can't find a word to say,  
My friends just laugh at me,  
There's no cure for this disease  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
I can't get enough,  
I wont break this fever  
I need her I'm bit by the bug  
  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love  
  
Don't need a shot,  
Don't need a doctor  
They can't make me ok  
It's up to you  
  
Give me an answer,  
Because I'm trying just to see you,  
Only want to feel you,  
Dying just to hear you say,  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
I can't get enough,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I wont break this fever,  
I need her I'm bit by the bug  
  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love,  
We've come down with love!

Moving Pictures
Kinks
----------------
Life is only a moving picture  
Nothing in life is permanent fixture  
Oh no, oh oh no  
  
Black girls, white girls oh what a mixture  
Looking as pretty as a picture  
Oh no, oh oh no  
  
We live, we die, no one knows why  
We come, we go, we see the show  
And it's always moving, always moving  
Life is only a moving picture  
  
Oh, life can sometimes not be very nice  
But then you make your choice so you must pay the price  
You take the good and bad 'cause life's all work and play  
And it soon fades away  
Oh no, oh oh no  
  
Life is only what you make of it  
So make the verses rhyme and all the pieces fit  
There isn't any time to make much sense of it  
It soon fades away  
Oh no, oh oh no  
  
Life is only a moving picture  
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture  
Oh no, oh oh no  
  
We live, we die, no one knows why  
We come, we go, we see the show  
And it's always moving, always moving  
Look at all those moving pictures  
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture  
Oh no, oh oh no  
  
It's only moving, only moving, only moving pictures

My Dear
America
----------------
Here in the dawn  
As I walk through this dream  
As I have done since ages now gone  
Shall I read you the letter  
They sent postmarked from somewhere out here  
It's in Latin, I think, I don't know  
Can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Near to their bed (they never sleep)  
They sit sipping their tea, watch the sea  
Move the sand through their heads (sit in their chairs by the bay)  
Did I show you the marks on the wall  
Left by captains now dead (house out on the cove)  
They fell fighting for peace in their lives  
Or so it is said (still nobody seems to be here)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
You can't miss it  
A blue forest on a green sky  
You must risk it  
Don't ignore us if you want us to  
If we want us to survive  
Where will I be (can't you help me to find my way)  
After watching them walking the pier  
At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)  
They're in love with the news  
And don't show if they're living in fear (still nobody seems to be here)  
They eat ice cream alone  
Watch the waves at the end of the pier (ah, nobody seems to hear)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear

This Summer
Squeeze
----------------
Brain engages mouth  
Mouth expresses thoughts  
Of how we shared those fun fair rides  
Beneath the brightness of the night  
Time can crowd the head  
Like a sardine can  
The summer that began to blur  
Has put us on the calendar  
  
This summer there won't be a cloud in the sky  
I'm so made up I feel I could take off and fly  
This summer we've pulled all the sheets off the bed  
I'm so happy I can't get you out of my head  
This summer I am so in love with you  
  
Mornings pass us by  
As curtains hide the sun  
Nights we spent out of control  
Like two flags wrapped around a pole  
  
I see the helter skelter lights  
And hear the music in the breeze  
And when we're skimming stones tonight  
It feels so good that you're with me  
  
This summer there won't be a cloud in the sky  
I'm so made up I feel I could take off and fly  
This summer we've pulled all the sheets off the bed  
I'm so happy I can't get you out of my head  
There's no reason to ever feel lonely again  
This summer I am so in love with you

Song For The Front Row
Ocean Colour Scene
----------------
These are the best times  
That you'll ever have  
Don't throw it away because  
You're younger that he is  
  
[Chorus]  
He's your father  
And he'll help you  
If you give him  
He's your father  
He'll deserve you  
If you give him time  
  
These are the best times  
So we'll march in time  
The sun is too ripe to let  
The moon shine on your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the straight ways  
Don't make it long  
Don't get yourself lost because  
You're following someone else's song  
  
[Chorus]

What Goes Up...
Alan Parsons Project
----------------
What goes up, must come down  
What must rise, must fall  
And what goes on in your life  
Is writing on the wall  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a miracle won't last  
  
What goes up, must come down  
What must stand alone?  
And what goes on, in your mind  
Is turning into stone  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a pyramid won't last  
  
How can you be so sure?  
How do you know what the earth will endure?  
How can you be so sure?  
That the wonders you've made in you life  
  
Will be seen  
By the millions who'll follow to visit the site  
Of your dream?  
  
What goes up, must come down  
What goes round, must come round  
What's been lost, must be found

Rush
Rush
----------------
When the dragons grow too mighty  
To slay with pen or sword  
I grow weary of the battle  
And the storm I walk toward  
When all around is madness  
And there's no safe port in view  
I long to turn my path homeward  
To stop awhile with you.  
When life becomes as barren  
And as cold winter skies  
There's a beacon in the darkness  
In a distant pair of eyes  
In vain to search for honor  
And in vain to search for truth  
But these things can still be given  
Your love has shown me proof.

Great Big Sea
----------------
Tishialuk girls are neat and tidy, Tishialuk girls it won't last long,  
Tishialuk girls they will be useful when Sam Cove is dead and gone.  
  
Aunt Rae wants me to wed her daughter, takes me from my heart's delight,  
Give me a girl from down in Tishialuk , shines in the eyes like diamonds
bright.  
  
Tishialuk girls are neat and tidy, Tishialuk girls it won't last long,  
Tishialuk girls they will be useful when Sam Cove is dead and gone.

Hot Legs
Rod Stewart
----------------
Who's that knocking on my door  
It's gotta be a quarter to four  
Is it you again coming 'round for more  
Well you can love me tonight if you want  
  
But in the morning make sure you're gone  
I'm talkin' to you  
  
Hot legs, wearing me out  
Hot legs, you can scream and shout  
Hot legs, are you still in school  
I love you honey  
  
Gotta most persuasive tongue  
You promise all kinds of fun  
But what you don't understand  
I'm a working man  
  
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E  
By the time you're finished with me  
I'm talking to you  
  
Hot legs, you're an alley cat  
Hot legs, you scratch my back  
Hot legs, bring your mother too  
I love you honey  
  
Imagine how my daddy felt  
In your jet black suspender belt  
Seventeen years old  
He's touching sixty four  
  
You got legs right up to your neck  
You're making me a physical wreck  
I'm talking to you  
  
Hot legs, in your satin shoes  
Hot legs, are you still in school  
Hot legs, you're making me a fool  
I love you honey  
  
Hot legs, making your mark  
Hot legs, keep my pencil sharp  
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself  
I love you honey  
  
Hot legs, you're wearing me out  
Hot legs, you can scream and shout  
Hot legs, you're still in school  
I love you honey

Beneath The Southern Cross
Patti Smith
----------------
Oh  
To be  
Not anyone  
Gone  
This maze of being  
Skin  
Oh  
To cry  
Not any cry  
So mournful that  
The dove just laughs  
The steadfast gasps  
  
Oh  
To owe  
Not anyone  
Nothing  
To be  
Not here  
But here  
Forsaking  
Equatorial bliss  
Who walked through  
The callow mist  
Dressed in scraps  
Who walked  
The curve of the world  
Whose bone scraped  
Whose flesh unfurled  
Who grieves not  
Anyone gone  
To greet lame  
The inspired sky  
Amazed to stumble  
Where gods get lost  
Beneath  
The southern cross

Under Ice
Kate Bush
----------------
It's wonderful  
Everywhere, so white  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me skating fast  
I'm speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice,  
Cotting out, little lines in the ice  
Splitting, splitting sound,  
Silver heels spitting, spitting snow.  
  
("Sonar says ? deep ?")  
  
There's something moving under  
Under the ice moving  
Under ice through water  
Trying to  
"It's me."  
Get out of the cold water  
"It's me."  
Something,  
"It's me."  
Someone, help them  
  
Wake up

Sure Don't Feel Like Love
Paul Simon
----------------
I registered to vote today  
Felt like a fool  
Had to do it anyway  
Down at the high school  
Thing about the second line  
You know, felt like a fool?  
People say it all the time  
Even when it's true  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Cause it sure don't feel like love  
  
A tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt  
The chemistry of crying is not concerned with blame or fault  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
'Cause it sure don't feel like love  
How does it feel?  
Feels like a threat  
A voice in your head that you'd rather forget  
No joke, no joke  
You get sick from that unspoken  
Sure don't feel like love  
No joke, no joke  
Some chicken and a corn muffin well that feels more like love  
  
Yay! Boo!  
Yay! Boo!  
  
Wrong again, wrong again  
Maybe I'm wrong again  
Wrong again  
Maybe I'm wrong again  
Wrong again  
I could be wrong again  
I remember once in August 1993  
I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember one of my best friends turned enemy  
So, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember once in a load-out, down in Birmingham  
Yeah, but that didn't feel like love  
Sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love  
Sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love  
It sure. Don't feel  
Like love

One Day
Verve
----------------
One day maybe we will dance again  
Under fiery skies  
One day maybe you will love again  
Love that never dies  
  
One day maybe you will see the land  
Touch skin with sand  
You've been swimming in the lonely sea  
With no company  
  
Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The roads, the highs, breaking up your life  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe you will cry again  
Just like a child  
You've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
  
Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The times, the highs, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
Oh, you're too afraid to touch  
Too afraid you'll like it too much  
The roads, the times, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe I will dance again  
One day maybe I will love again  
One day maybe we will dance again  
You know you've gotta  
Tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
One day maybe you will love again  
You've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end

The Weeknd

I'm paying for all my father's sins  
So I will thank him for you  
I'ma thank him for you  
My serotonin's got a while to go  
Girl, it's gone 'cause of you  
It's been gone 'cause of you  
  
They say, they want heaven  
They say, they want God  
I say, I got heaven  
Well I say, I am God  
  
I never prayed a moment in my life  
Girl I'm rewarded with you  
I've been rewarded with you  
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh  
Let me kiss it for you  
I can kiss it for you  
  
They say, they want heaven  
They say, they want God  
I say, I have heaven  
I say, I am God

When I Think About Leaving
Kenny Chesney
----------------
You know some times me and my lady have these crazy fights and when we do it
makes me wonder  
Are we're ever gonna get it right  
  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
What my life would be like if I were back to being free  
Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer
to  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
  
You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had
all he could  
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye  
  
When I think about leaving I think about him  
That little apartment cross town he's living in  
Got an old Corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other
weekend  
When I think about leaving oh I think about him  
  
I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he
walked out on her  
And her mom when she was just a kid  
  
When I think about leaving oh I think about her  
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt  
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are
you coming  
Back  
When I think about leaving I think about her  
  
You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we
got something  
Special  
When I think about leaving I think about us  
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender
way we touch,  
All those nights we spent making love,  
When I think about leaving oh I think about us  
  
When I think about leaving I think again  
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then  
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would
rather be  
When I think about leaving I think again  
  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving: I think again

As Much As Always
Dolly Parton
----------------
I hoped I wouldn't miss you long  
But I still can't believe you're gone  
And I still miss you just as much as always  
I hoped I'd get you off my mind  
It's been a long time but I find  
That I still think of you as much as always  
As much as always, as much as always  
Just as much as always  
As much as always just as much as always  
I still miss you, still think of you  
Just as much as always, as much as always  
Just as much as always  
I still want you, still need you  
Just as much as always  
I hoped that I'd find someone else  
But there's too much of you still left  
And I still love you , just as much as always  
I hoped that I'd forget your touch  
But I still want it just as much  
And I still need it just as much as always  
As much as always, as much as always  
Just as much as always  
As much as always, just as much as always  
I still miss you, still think of you  
Just as much as always  
As much as always, just as much as always  
I still love you, oh I do love you  
Just as much as always  
As much as always, as much as always  
I still love you, still want you, just as much as always  
As much as always, just as much as always  
I still need you still love you  
Just as much as always

Breakfast At Tiffany's
Everclear
----------------
You'll say, we've got nothing in common,  
No common ground to start from,  
And we're falling apart,  
You'll say, the world has come between us,  
Our lives have come between us,  
Still I know you just don't care.  
  
And I said, "What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'"  
She said, "I think I remember the film,  
And as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it. "  
And I said, "Well that's, the one thing we've got."  
  
I see you, the only one who knew me,  
And now your eyes see through me,  
I guess I was wrong,  
So what now? It's plain to see we're over,  
And I hate when things are over,  
When so much is left undone.  
  
And I said, "What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'"  
She said, "I think I, remember that film,  
And, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it, "  
And I said, "Well that's, the one thing we got."  
  
You'll say, that we've got nothing in common,  
No common ground to start from,  
And we're falling apart,  
You'll say the world has come between us,  
Our lives have come between us,  
Still I know you just don't care.  
  
And I said, "What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'"  
She said, "I think I, remember that film,  
And, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it, "  
And I said, "Well that's, the one thing we got."  
  
Oooooo  
  
And I said, "What about 'Breakfast at Tiffany's?'"  
She said, "I think I, remember that film,  
And, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it, "  
And I said, "Well that's, the one thing we got."

If I Were A Boy
Reba Mcentire
----------------
If I were a boy even just for a day  
I'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what I wanted and go  
  
Drink beer with the guys and chase after girls  
I'd kick it with who I wanted and I'd never get confronted for it,  
'Cause they stick up for me  
  
If I were a boy, I think I could under stand  
How it feels to love a girl, I swear I'd be a better man  
  
And I'd listen to her,'cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted, 'cause he's takin' you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
If I were a boy, I would turn off my phone  
Tell everyone it's broken, so they'd think that I was sleepin' alone  
  
I'd put myself first and make the rules as I go  
'Cause I know that she'll be faithful, waitin' for me to come home,  
To come home  
  
And if I were a boy, I think I could understand  
How it feels to love a girl, I swear I'd be a better man  
  
And I'd listen to her, 'cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted, 'cause he's takin' you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
It's a little too late for you to come back  
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd for give you like that  
If you thought I would wait for you, you thought wrong  
  
But you're just a boy, you don't understand, you don't understand  
Oh, how it (feels to love a girl someday, you wish you were a better man  
Oh, you don't listen to her, and you don't care how it hurts  
Until you lose the one you wanted, 'cause you're takin' her for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
But you're just a boy

Snake Mountain Blues
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
Mr ten dollar man  
Let me tell where you're bound  
Drink your green liqour, Lord  
You'll roll to the ground  
But you come around here  
With your money in your hand  
Taste of my woman  
Well, you die where you stand  
  
Snake mountain blues  
Got me down low  
I could die in the morning  
But no one would know  
When my woman come around  
My body she'd find  
Go down to Dundee  
Have her a time  
  
Snake mountain gonna crumble  
And fall from the sky  
Before that woman of mine  
Stops tellin' her lies  
If I'd die, Lord, she'd weep  
She'd weep and she'd mourn  
Soon as I's buried  
Forget I'd been born  
  
Love of blackskin woman  
She won't do you no wrong  
Slow to start moaning  
She don't moan for long  
Yellow headed woman  
Brings nothing but pain  
Take all you give her  
She leaves only shame  
  
My daddy, Lord, he rides  
On a long holy train  
First winds of winter  
I see him again  
In this farewell to this  
Yellow headed misery I've known  
Snake mountain's calling  
Calling me home  
  
Snake mountain blues  
Got me down low  
I could die in the morning  
But no one would know  
When my woman come around  
My body she'd find  
Go down to Dundee  
Have her a time

Who can say where the road goes  
Where the day flows, only time  
And who can say if your love grows  
As your heart chose, only time  
  
Who can say why your heart sighs  
As your love flies, only time  
And who can say why your heart cries  
When your love lies, only time  
  
Who can say when the roads meet  
That love might be in your heart  
And who can say when the day sleeps  
If the night keeps all your heart  
Night keeps all your heart  
  
Who can say if your love grows  
As your heart chose  
Only time  
And who can say where the road goes  
Where the day flows, only time  
  
Who knows? Only time

Wide River
Steve Miller Band
----------------
Wide river she opens her mouth to the sea  
Singin' dear dear ocean now, here is a kiss from me  
And she runs like a river to the setting sun  
She runs like a river that has never been won  
She runs like a river that will always be free  
  
Wide river, carry me back home  
To the place I love, that I call my own  
And we can run like a river to the setting sun  
Run like a river that has never been won  
Run like a river that will always be free  
  
Wide river, do you remember me?  
It was not so long ago that you set me free  
And now I run like a river to the setting sun  
I run like a river that has never been won  
I run like a river that will always be free  
  
Come on baby, let's run in circles  
Come on darlin', let's circle each other  
And find our love, all the love that we need  
  
Come on baby, let's circle each other  
What we can do, do for each other  
I'll do for you, and you'll do for me  
  
And we can run like a river to the setting sun  
Run like a river that has never been won  
Run like a river that will always be free

Nina, Pretty Ballerina
ABBA
----------------
Every day in the morning on her way to the office  
You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
She would like to play it every day  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play

A Man And A Woman
U2
----------------
Little sister don't you worry about a thing today  
Take the heat from the sun  
Little sister  
I know that everything is not ok  
But you're like honey on my tongue  
  
True love never can be rent  
But only true love can keep beauty innocent  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
No I could never take a chance  
'Cause I could never understand  
The mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
You can run from love  
And if it's really love it will find you  
Catch you by the heel  
But you can't be numb for love  
The only pain is to feel nothing at all  
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
And you're the one, there's no-one else  
You make me want to lose myself  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
Brown eyed girl across the street  
On rue Saint Divine  
I thought this is the one for me  
But she was already mine  
You were already mine...  
  
Little sister  
I've been sleeping in the street again  
Like a stray dog  
Little sister  
I've been trying to feel complete again  
But you're gone and so is God  
  
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate  
When the soul wants...the soul waits ...  
  
No I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
For love and sex and faith and fear  
And all the things that keep us here  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

Isn't It A Pity
Nina Simone
----------------
Isn't it a pity  
You don't know what I'm talking about yet  
But I'm gonna tell you soon  
It's a pity  
Isn't it a pity  
Isn't it a shame  
Yes, how we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to remember  
Just forgetting a note of thank you  
Isn't it a pity  
Some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see that we are all just the same  
We're all guilty  
Because all the tears  
Our eyes just can't hope to see  
But I don't think it's applicable to me  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Child, isn't it a pity  
How we take each other's love  
The most precious thing without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to keep open the door  
But I understand some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see, we're just the same  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes can't hope to see  
The beauty that surrounds them  
God, isn't it a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
It's a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
It's a pity  
The beauty that surrounds us  
And we don't see it  
We think things are just the same  
We've been programmed that way  
Isn't it a pity  
If you want to feel sorry  
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a pity  
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us  
Because of all our tears  
Our eyes can't hope to see  
Maybe one day at least I'll see me  
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'  
And till that day mankind don't stand a chance  
Don't know nothin' about romance, everything is plastic  
Isn't it a pity  
My God

How Many Times
Peter Cetera
----------------
[Chorus]  
How many tears have you cried  
How many eyes have you dried  
How many ways have you tried  
And don't you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
  
How many dream have been bad  
How many nights have been sad  
How many days have you had  
When you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, how many times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said tired of people sayin'  
Don't you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, times, times, times  
Times, times, times, times, times

All Mod Cons
The Jam
----------------
Seen you before, I know your sort  
You think the world awaits your every breath  
You'll be my friend, or so you say  
You'll help me out when the time comes  
  
And all the time we're getting rich  
You hang around to help me out  
  
But when we're skint, oh God forbid!  
You drop us like hot bricks  
  
Artistic freedom. Do what you want  
But just make sure that the money ain't gone  
  
I'll tell you what, I got you sussed  
You'll waste my time, when my time comes

Are You Gonna Go My Way - Live
Lenny Kravitz
----------------
It ain't over till it's over  
  
Here we are still together  
We are one  
So much time wasted  
Playing games with love  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over  
  
How many times did we give up  
But we always worked things out  
And all my doubts and fear  
Kept me wondering if I'd always be in love  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over

Carefree Highway
Gordon Lightfoot
----------------
Pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream  
I wonder how the old folks are tonight  
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face  
She left me not knowin' what to do  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best  
I wonder if she'll ever do the same  
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied  
With knowin' I got no one left to blame  
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep  
I wonder if the years have closed her mind  
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free  
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you

Ice Is Workin' It
Vanilla Ice
----------------
Yo! here comes the intro  
It's time to let it go  
I live the life of my rhyme, I think I'll let it show  
So, keep it goin' so the mic can stay warm  
Then I know I've been doin' my job 'cause there'll be sweat pourin'  
  
So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip  
I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip  
So pump your fist like this, but don't miss  
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this  
Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor  
I know you adore 'cause that's what you came for  
The ice rhymer is back and livin' large  
And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage  
'cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this  
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist  
So sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit  
Or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin' it  
  
[Chorus]  
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work  
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby  
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work  
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby  
  
Go white boy, go white boy, go!  
Check out the hook. vanilla ice, yep, yep  
  
I'm makin' a killin' and chillin' because I'm cool as an ice  
Pack  
You're lovin' everything when I think of a new track  
I keep my rhyme flowin', notice it's right on time  
And separate the wax and keep my mic in line  
So put your body in motion and let me know that you're there  
And those playin' the wall don't be scared  
'cause it's a foundation of breaks put to a beat  
Strong as concrete 'cause I'm rockin' the beat  
I'm in rock mode now' cause I'm steppin' like a soldier  
Move to the groove and try to hold your composure  
Never the less I'm back to attack  
I came to manifest, and express to this dope track  
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice  
That's why the ladies scraem...oh! vanilla ice!  
Forthcomin' I'm risin' to the top  
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop  
That's what I though, you're cause by the friction  
Pens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'  
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked  
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it  
Don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell  
I know it's hard to regard 'cause I'm loved by the females  
Masses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt  
No one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault  
So pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to  
My dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you  
The concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook  
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea  
The crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end  
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands  
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop  
If you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper  
Flip this thing and sting like a viper  
Rollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent  
If there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it  
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be  
With slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe  
Sheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal  
The dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal  
But, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout  
To rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about  
Money, yea, is the key to all problems  
If you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em  
'cause I got the key, the key to attack  
The knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track  
To my foes, I can show I can flow 'cause I'm legit  
Thinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it  
  
[Chorus]

Misty Glass Window
Erik Santos
----------------
Rain falls  
Dark clouds are racing up above  
I gaze in solitude  
Looking through a misty glass window  
'Cause then it used to be the two of us  
  
This empty room  
Filled my thoughts with memories of you  
I turned and looked around  
Oh, but found no sight of you  
I guess it'll never be as true, no no ooh  
  
Chorus  
Starlight  
All I need is you tonight  
Oh, starbright  
Grant my wish tonight  
I'm beggin' you, starlight  
All I need is you tonight  
Hoh, starbright  
Get rid of the spell tonight, ooh  
  
Rain falls  
Dark clouds keep racing up above  
It's still in solitude  
Oh, longin' for you  
Guess my heart will always be with you  
My heart will always be with you  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Hoh, starbright  
Get rid of the spell tonight

Tlc  
Hands Up  
  
Rollin' to the club  
Stop to get my grub on  
Nothin' like those Krispy Kremes  
Soon as I was done  
It was time to get my groove on  
Find a place that's happenin'  
And I knew that it was on  
  
From the moment that I walked into the spot  
It was bangin'  
It was swangin' oh  
Till somethin' turned me off  
I wasn't sure  
Coulda swore I saw you with someone  
And at much to my surprise (whoa)  
  
Chorus:  
You were right there with your hands up in the air  
You had hoochies everywhere  
All on you  
It's like I almost didn't know you  
Tryin' to shake that ass  
Playa you don't even dance  
Sup wit' you  
It's like I don't even know you  
  
Left you at the crib  
Cause I know you get your game on  
Happens every Tuesday night  
You said that you was cool  
Your boys was comin' by  
(Go baby have yourself a real good time)  
So I knew I could be wrong  
  
I was thinkin' there's no way it could be you  
Not my baby  
He ain't crazy no  
Then my girlfriends tipped me off  
When I got closer I could tell that it was you  
You was bangin'  
You was swangin' oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Mindin' my own business  
My pager's goin' off  
My girlfriends tryin' to tell me  
You're doin' wrong  
I needed confirmation  
I knew you was a dog  
I just can't believe what I saw  
  
Chorus

The Wayward Wind
Waterboys
----------------
In a lonesome shack by the railroad track  
I spent my younger days  
And I guess the sound of the outward bound  
Made me a slave  
To my wandering queen  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
I met her down in a border town  
we swore we'd never part  
Though I tried my best to settle down  
now she's all alone  
With a broken heart  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
the next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
the next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
The next of kin  
to the wayward, wayward wind

Rock Me
One Direction

Do you remember summer '09  
Wanna go back there every night  
Just can't lie it was the best time of my life  
Lying on the beach as the sun blew out  
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud  
Oh my my they could never shut us down  
  
I used to think that I was better alone  
Why did I ever want to let you go  
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea  
The words you whispered I will always believe  
  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me, yeah  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
  
Yeah we were together summer '09  
Wanna roll back like press and rewind  
You were mine and we never said goodbye  
  
I used to think that I was better alone (Better alone)  
Why did I ever want to let you go?(Let you go)  
Under the moonlight as we stared to the sea (Stared at the sea)  
The words you whispered I will always believe  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me, yeah  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
  
R-O-C-K me again  
R-O-C-K me again

I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah

Only Time Will Tell
Poison
----------------
I just needed someone to hold  
When the bottle was empty  
and the nights grew cold  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
You were my angel of mercy  
And helped me to believe  
  
You touched my soul  
When I was lonely  
You held me up  
when I couldn't fly  
  
There's no words could explain  
How I feel inside  
And this I tell you  
  
In a world full of anger  
and times gone strange  
You held me close  
You held me close to you  
  
Lay my head on your shoulder  
I finally let it all out  
It felt good for a moment  
Not living in a shadow of doubt  
  
But everybody needs a little something  
Tu pull them through  
I gave one for the other  
And God know that the other was you  
  
Chorus:  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road along  
  
My angel of mercy  
Pulled me through somehow  
I just hope you know  
I need you now  
  
You're the one  
That touched my very soul  
The one who held on tight  
God knows you never let go  
  
Angel of mercy  
It's time we closed the door  
Put out the lights  
And burn the fire  
Burn the fire inside  
  
Angel of mercy  
You pulled me through  
And this I tell to you  
God know I'd tell it to you

Machine And Soul
Gary Numan
----------------
She likes film  
Pictures too  
A friend of mine  
Something new  
  
She likes girls  
Lives my dreams  
Eats my face  
She says 'Time to make me scream'  
  
No crying  
She don't like tears  
My one chance  
Is corruption  
  
(So get up  
So get up and dance)  
  
She likes pain  
'E please Bob'  
Some heroes  
But she don't like God  
  
She likes rock  
MTV  
Sex machines  
She says 'Time to make me bleed'  
  
No romance  
No surprise  
My one chance  
Is perversion  
  
So this is  
My secret  
So this is  
A new way to hide  
  
So this is  
My nightmare  
And you're my  
Solution  
  
No memories  
Nostalgia  
My one chance  
Is slow motion  
  
So this is  
The big lie  
So this is  
My reason to leave  
  
So this is  
My future  
And you're my  
Corruption  
  
She likes speed  
Low fast cars  
Love and hate  
Rock and roll stars  
  
She likes cream  
Long goodbyes  
Someone to watch  
And she says 'Time to make me cry'  
  
I'm nervous  
She scares me  
My one chance  
Is emotion  
  
So this is  
Religion  
So this is  
Something to believe  
  
So this is  
God's disease  
So this is  
A new kind of cure  
  
So this is  
A new world  
And you're my  
Machine and soul

Mystery Train
Bon Jovi
----------------
There are days when she's a whisper  
Nights when she's a scream  
A reason to wake up in the morning  
To close your eyes and dream  
  
She'll curse you like a sailor  
She'll wound you with her eyes  
She always makes it better  
But she won't apologize  
I know everything about her but don't know her at all  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place you've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
You're not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
Mystery train  
  
She cries because she's happy  
She sings songs when she's mad  
Like a stiff drink when you need it  
She's good at being bad  
And long before you knew her you knew she was the one  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place you've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
You're not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
Mystery train  
  
I know everything about her but don't know her at all  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place I've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
I'm not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
On a mystery train  
She's a ride  
On a mystery train

Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go  
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow  
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below  
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago  
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit  
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with  
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it  
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with  
I hope that my success never alters our relationship  
Yeah, this life is something I would die for  
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th  
I just wish they'd let you try it first  
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me  
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery  
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me  
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though  
You never see it coming you just get to see it go  
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first  
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks!  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first  
That's why I'm really going off, Fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh

Sirens
Zebrahead
----------------
I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die  
You can bury my heart with your box of lies  
Cut me down to size, it's no surprise  
You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties  
  
Gimme an "F", gimme a "U"  
Gimme a "CK YOU"  
Read between the lines, I guess love is blind  
Want me to spell it out for you?  
  
I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die  
You can bury my heart with your box of lies  
Come on, pose with me in this sick machine  
It looks like I'm going down in this murder scene  
  
Try and try to bend and break me  
I won't feel anything  
Try and try to suffocate me  
No pleasure like the pain  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
I can't wait to bring you  
Down, Down, Down, Down  
  
Gimme a "U", gimme an "R"  
Gimme "A Bitch" yeah you are  
Don't pretend to cry, kiss your ass, goodbye  
I got 99 reasons why  
  
Cut me down to size, it's no surprise  
You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties  
Come on, punish me if it's what you need  
Tie me up, break me down, you can watch me bleed  
  
Try and try to bend and break me  
I won't feel anything  
Try and try to suffocate me  
No pleasure like the pain  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
I can't wait to bring you  
Down, Down, Down, Down  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down, Down  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
I can't wait to bring you  
Down, Down, Down, Down

Grown Up Christmas List
Christmas Songs
----------------
Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you  
With childhood fantasies  
  
Well, I'm all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
I'm not a child  
But my heart still can dream  
  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown up christmas list  
Not for myself  
But for a world in need  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely  
Wrapped beneath our tree  
  
Well heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal  
A hurting human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
(there'd be)  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, oh  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
This is my grown up christmas list

Alone
Glee
----------------
I hear the ticking of the clock  
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark  
I wonder where you are tonight  
No answer on the telephone  
And the night goes by so very slow  
Oh I hope that it won't end though  
Alone  
  
Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
You don't know how long I have wanted  
To touch your lips and hold you tight  
You don't know how long I have waited  
And I was going to tell you tonight  
But the secret is still my own  
And my love for you is still unknown  
Alone  
  
Aah aah aah  
  
Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
Alone, alone  
  
I hear the ticking of the clock  
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark

Manhattan Moon
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
The ship was heaving with a mass of humankind  
My heart was grieving for the the land that lay behind  
The cruel ocean echoed all those sad goodbyes  
That at my leaving almost made me change my mind  
The night was darker than my scared and lonely eyes  
  
And then that old Manhattan moon began to rise  
And there stood Liberty in silhouetted skies  
And from that moment on I knew that I'd embrace  
Each opportunity to be a part of this place  
Five points and then Hell's Kitchen  
All stops in between  
Somewhere to find an itchin' for this keen Colleen  
Didn't stop me yearning now and then for my old world  
Dreamed I might return just once again to that old world  
But in my heart a piano roll played ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love that old Manhattan moon  
  
I swore allegiance at each rising of the moon  
And learned by heart each swinging Yankee Doodle tune  
And from the moment it first caught me in its beam  
I knew that moon would guide my old American dream  
Five points to Fifth Avenue Central  
All stops in between  
No time to get too sentimental for any shade of green  
That don't stop me yearning now and then for that funny old world  
Could be I'll return just once again to that funny old world  
But in my heart a piano roll plays ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love my old Manhattan moon
