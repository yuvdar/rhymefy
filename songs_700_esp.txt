Cocodrilo
Inframundo
----------------
¿Eres tu?
Es eso
¿Eres realmente tú?
Llamar entre mis labios
Dos dedos canguro empujan
A través y arañar mi espalda en ritmo.
  
Pie lento
Lento rápido
Esperando una noche para envolvernos
Yo podria entrar alli
Conseguir algunas cosas dulces
  
Todas estas cosas
En mi (en mi)
Todas estas cosas
En mi (en mi)
  
¿Eres tu?
Es eso
¿Eres realmente tú?
Para sostener debajo de mi piel
Dos números hacen clic entre su toque.
Cuando me tiras hacia ellos
Levantándose y subiendo
[a través del interior de una pintura de ojos de cristal]
Llamandome ahi
Conseguir esas cosas dulces
  
Todas estas cosas
En mi (en mi)
Todas estas cosas
En mi (en mi)
  
Cosas de Vocoder [¿Caminaste alrededor de las escaleras?]
  
¿Eres tu?
Es eso
¿Eres realmente tú?
Arrastrarse entre mis labios.
Dos dedos canguro empujan
A través y arañar mi espalda en ritmo.
  
Pie lento
Lento rápido
Esperando una noche para envolvernos
Yo podria entrar alli
Conseguir algunas cosas dulces
  
Todas estas cosas
En mi
Todas estas cosas
En mi

Montarlo
Tiffany
----------------
(Sexual, sexual, irresistible)
(Sexual, sexual, irresistible)
he pensado en ello
Tu y yo
Es hora de hacer mi movimiento
Algo bueno
Está en marcha
Un fenómeno
No soy ese tipo de chica para ser tan sexual
Tal vez sea físico pero no me importa
Esta vez voy a dejar ir
Así que baja las luces.
Voy a moverlo despacio
Y no voy a dejar ir
Vamos a montarlo, montarlo
Mantenerlo encendido
Hasta el amanecer
Bebé toda la noche
Vamos a montarlo, montarlo
No hay duda de eso
No puedo negar
La forma en que me haces sentir
No nos imaginemos
No es un sueño
Es algo real
Nunca pensé que el amor pudiera ser tan sexual.
Pero ahora estoy aquí contigo y no tengo miedo.
Dejarme mostrar mis sentimientos.
Repite el coro
he pensado en ello
Tu y yo
Es hora de hacer mi movimiento
Algo bueno
Está en marcha
Un fenómeno
No soy ese tipo de chica para ser tan sexual
Tal vez sea físico pero no me importa
No voy a dejar ir

Silencio por favor, hay una dama en el escenario
Polvoriento springfield
----------------
Silencio por favor, hay una dama en el escenario.
Ella no puede ser la última rabia
Pero ella está cantando y lo dice en serio.
Y ella merece un poco de silencio.
  
Silencio por favor, hay una mujer allá arriba.
Y ella ha sido honesta a través de sus canciones.
Mucho antes de que su conciencia fuera elevada
¿Eso no merece un pequeño elogio?
  
Así que junten sus manos y ayúdenla.
Todo lo que queda de la cantante.
Todo lo que queda de la canción.
Soporte para la ovación
Y dale una última celebración.
  
Tranquilo por favor, hay una persona allá arriba
Y ella ha estado cantando de las cosas.
Que ninguno de nosotros podría soportar escuchar por nosotros mismos.
Dale tu respeto si nada más
  
Silencio por favor, hay una dama en el escenario.
Conductor, pasa la pagina final.
Y cuando todo termine podemos irnos a casa.
Pero ella vive, solo en el escenario.

Haciendo las cosas que queremos
Lou Reed
----------------
La otra noche fuimos a ver la obra de Sam.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Fue muy físico que te llevó al escenario.
Haciendo las cosas que él quiere ...
  
El tipo es un vaquero de algún rodeo.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
La niña lo había amado una vez, pero ahora quiere ir.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos ...
  
El hombre era optimista, la mujer era una burla.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Lucharon con sus palabras, sus cuerpos y sus obras.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Cuando terminaron de pelear, emocionaron el escenario.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Me impresionó mucho la forma en que se habían comportado.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos ...
  
Me recuerda a las películas que Marty hizo sobre Nueva York.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Esas películas francas y brutales que son tan brillantes.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
'Fool For Love' conoce 'The Raging Bull'
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Son muy inspiradores, me encantan las cosas que hacen.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos ...
  
No hay mucho que escuches en la radio hoy.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Pero todavía puedes ver una película o una obra de teatro.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Aquí está 'Travis Bickle' y aquí está 'Johnny Boy'
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
Crecer en las callejuelas de Nueva York.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
  
Escribí esta canción porque me gustaría estrechar tu mano.
Haciendo las cosas que queremos hacer.
De alguna manera, ustedes son los mejores amigos que he tenido
Haciendo las cosas que queremos ...

Ido demasiado largo
Townes Van Zandt
----------------
He estado fuera demasiado tiempo
Demasiado tiempo pasado demasiado tiempo
He estado viajando duro
Simplemente no puedo volver a casa
Es difícil de creer que hice todo mal
  
Quiero encontrarme un siete
Los sietes no son tan malos
Seven está sobre el mejor amigo
Este pobre chico ha tenido
Te conseguiste un siete
Uno y seis no parecen tan tristes
  
No estoy solo
Estar solo por mucho tiempo
Estoy harto de cantar esta misma canción solitaria.
Voy a encontrarme un siete y querida
Estoy llegando a casa
  
Es solitario por esta vieja carretera.
Cariño, no me quedaré aquí.
No pretendo quedarme
Puede que no me quieras. Estoy viniendo a casa de todos modos.
  
Cuando el sol llega creepin '
Sobre la ladera de la montaña
Al menos me acuesto y me digo que lo intenté.
No es como si alguien se sentara
En ninguna zanja y llora
  
He estado fuera demasiado tiempo
Demasiado tiempo pasado demasiado tiempo
Viajando duro no puedo volver a casa
Es difícil de creer que hice todo mal
  
Demasiado lejos
Demasiado tiempo pasado demasiado tiempo
Viajando duro, simplemente no puedo volver a casa
Es difícil de creer que hice todo mal
Es difícil de creer que hice todo mal

Girando la rueda
George Michael
----------------
Cinco de la mañana
No estas en casa
No puedo dejar de pensar que es extraño.
Bebé solo quiero que sepas
No voy a pasar por eso otra vez
Sí, esas nubes se están acercando.
  
Y no aceptaré esto como parte de mi vida.
No viviré con miedo
De lo que puede ser
Y las lecciones que he aprendido.
Prefiero estar solo que verte
Girando esa rueda por mi
  
Tienes algo sobre el peligro
¿No consigues lo que quieres de mí?
Tienes algo de extraños
Bebé, eso es lo que solíamos ser.
Tienes algo sobre el peligro bebe
Supongo que el hambriento no puede ver
Uno de estos días
Vas a traer algo a casa para mi
  
Seis de la mañana
No estas en casa
No puedo dejar de pensar que es extraño.
Parece que todos se arriesgan
Estos días
Oh sí, estamos parados bajo la lluvia
  
Y no aceptaré esto como parte de mi vida.
  
Como puedes amarme
Cuando estas jugando con mi vida
Dices que me das tiempo y lo haré mejor, lo juro.
Dame tiempo y te llevaré de vuelta a la desesperación.
Y no quiero volver allí.

(Margie's At) El Lincoln Park Inn
Tom T. Hall
----------------
Mi nombre está en el periódico donde llevé a los Boy Scouts a caminar
Mis manos están todas sucias de trabajar en la bicicleta de mi pequeño
El predicador vino y hablé un minuto con él.
Mi esposa está en la cocina y Margie's en el Lincoln Park Inn
  
Y sé por qué está allí porque he estado allí antes
Pero hice la promesa de no hacer más trampas.
  
Intenté ignorarlo, pero sé que está ahí, mi amiga.
Mi mente está en un número y Margie's en el Lincoln Park Inn
  
El próximo domingo es mi turno de hablar con la clase de los jóvenes.
Esperan respuestas a todas las preguntas que hacen.
¿Qué dirían si yo hablara en un pecado moderno?
Y todos los de Margie en todos los Lincoln Park Inns
  
La bicicleta está completamente arreglada y mi niño pequeño está en la cama dormido.
Su pequeño cachorro viejo está acurrucado en una bola a mis pies.
Las galletas para hornear de mi esposa para alimentar al club del puente de nuevo.
Estoy casi sin cigarrillos y Margie's en el Lincoln Park Inn
  
Y sé por qué está allí.

Pequeña señorita amante,
¿Dónde has estado en este mundo durante tanto tiempo?
Bueno, amo a un amante que se siente como tú.

Bueno, realmente no necesito ayuda niñita
Pero creo que podrías ayudarme de todos modos.
Ah me lo despidas
¿Creerías bebé que he estado buscando un alma?
Que se siente como tu
Durante algún tiempo
  
Disculpa mientras veo
Si el gitano en mí tiene razón.
Si no te importa
Bueno me señala bien
Así que creo que es seguro decir
Voy a hacer una obra
Ah sí
Veme caminar hacia ti bebe

Fuera de aquí, no hay programas de televisión.
Pero tenemos ratones en la cocina.
Así que no nos importa porque estamos enamorados.
  
Estas en la ducha, te veo alli
Te compro algo de hippie de Deli en la planta baja, oh sí
Lovin en el espacio de mi hombre, tan bueno.
  
No me olvides bebe
No me olvides cuando salgo y salgo al aire libre.
Porque sé que tu vida será un ronquido.
Estarás atascado en esta puta cuando estés
Esta puta, wh-re-ooh
  
No tienes nada, estás en la habitación de al lado.
Te dormiste en mi bus turístico
Pero yo, Fernando y Paul pasaremos el día haciendo música.
Pero te extraño
  
La nevera está rota y estamos bebiendo champán caliente.
Pero no nos importa porque estamos en Minnesota
Y estamos agotados mostrar de nuevo
Y es un espectáculo agotado de nuevo.

Por un barco o un tren ... está lejos,
Muy lejos ... Charlie ... tengo una
Sintiendo que ya no estamos en Kansas)

Hay una aguja en mi brazo
Y me siento como la ciudad de Nueva York.
Llevame a la granja
Llevame a la granja

Soy un hombre egocéntrico
Me enredo en mi freakness

Una fiesta en el cielo
Creo que voy a llevar un vestido
  
Dios nos salva a todos y nos cuenta como termina.
Ríete hasta que caigamos, ¿por qué no podemos ser amigos?
  
La madre me enseñó qué hacer en los cócteles.
Trabaja y juega todo el día hasta que el sol esté alto.
Haley y los cometas cantaron una vieja mermelada de roca.
El ukelele tocará otra canción de la que voy a presumir.
  
Dios nos salva a todos y nos cuenta como termina.
Ríete hasta que caigamos, ¿por qué no podemos ser amigos?
  
Robó mucho de peter
Porque tuve que pagar a tu Paul
Y cuando descubras que no es suficiente.
Él romperá tu caída

Sostenme en tus brazos
Rick Astley

Llevamos mucho tiempo intentando
Decir lo que queremos decir.
Pero los sentimientos no son fáciles.
Expresar de forma sencilla.
  
Pero todos tenemos sentimientos.
Todos necesitamos amor
¿Y quién sería el tonto de decir, que si
  
Sostenme en tus brazos
No me sentiré mejor
Si me sostienes en tus brazos
Podemos desafiar esta tormenta juntos
  
Los dos sabemos que hay un problema
Un problema que tenemos que afrontar.
Así que confía en mí, amante.
Nadie va a tomar tu lugar
  
Porque todos tenemos un problema
Todos tenemos miedos
Pero siempre tiene que haber una manera.
Si todos tenemos sentimientos
Todos necesitamos amor
Y sería un tonto decir que si
  
Sostenme en tus brazos
No me sentiré mejor
Si me sostienes en tus brazos
Podemos desafiar esta tormenta juntos
  
Solo tienes que abrazarme
Tócame para hacerme sentir tan bien.
Solo tienes que abrazarme
Sienteme
Para hacerme sentir como debes saber.
  
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Cuando me vas a tener en tus brazos.
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos
Sostenme en tus brazos

Entonces un día entraste en mi vida.

Ahora que has llenado mi vida de amor.
Nadie más podría significar tanto para mí.
Cada día mi alta dura más tiempo.
A medida que nuestro amor se hace cada vez más fuerte.
  
Ayer no hubiera creído
Que mañana brille el sol.
Entonces un día entraste en mi vida.
Estoy vivo de nuevo Estoy vivo de nuevo
  
Cuando me diste tu amor cambiaste mi vida.
Los sueños que antes parecían desesperados vienen con facilidad.
Gracias chica por ser tal como eres.
Yo nunca trataria de cambiarte
Todo por lo que vivo es para amarte
Me siento vivo de nuevo
Me siento vivo de nuevo

Mujer, comencemos este shindig, woo! ¡Vamos todo el mundo!
Ahora, ¿qué diablos está mal con esta máquina de juke? "
  
"Tenga cuidado, mis hijos seis visitarán seguidos por el desmoronamiento del tiempo
Sí mismo. Antes de la llegada de Shangra La, un oscuro carnaval barrerá
La tierra, como una sombra, plagada de destrucción. Un desfile de monstruos,
Malabaristas, y la muerte. Esta miserable pesadilla es liderada por seis caras. Tres tienen
A las tres han ido. El cuarto emerge ahora. El camina entre
Nosotros como una sombra, vacía de luz, alimentada por tu propia oscuridad, fortalecida por
Tu propia maldad. Un horrible reflejo de tus propios deseos profundos.
Y reflejado de nuevo sobre ti mismo. ¡Hermanos y hermanas! El tiempo ha llegado
Para el Necromaster. El desencadenamiento de la cuarta carta del joker. La llegada
Del Gran Milenko Milenko Milenko "

No puedo ser nadie mas
Me siento supersónico
Dame ginebra y tónica
  
Puedes tenerlo todo, pero ¿cuánto lo quieres?
Me haces reir
Dame tu autografo
¿Puedo ir contigo en tu BMW?
  
Puedes navegar conmigo en mi submarino amarillo.
Usted necesita descubrir
Porque nadie te va a decir de qué estoy hablando.
Necesitas encontrar una manera para lo que quieres decir.
  
Pero antes de mañana
Porque mi amigo dijo que te llevaría a casa
Se sienta en un rincón completamente solo.
Vive bajo una cascada
  
Ningún cuerpo puede verlo
Ningún cuerpo puede oírlo llamar
Necesitas ser tu mismo
No puedes ser nadie mas
  
Conozco a una chica llamada Elsa
Ella está en Alka Seltzer
Lo huele a través de un bastón en un tren supersónico.
Ella me hizo reir
  
Tengo su autografo
Lo hizo con un médico en un helicóptero.
Ella está oliendo en su tejido

A veces siento que estoy existiendo.
No estoy realmente viviendo
Solo estoy viendo como se va el tiempo
He olvidado quien soy en ti
No soy quien se supone que sea, no
Me estoy alejando más de mi destino.

Despierta tu poder y toma el control.
Despierta la pasión de vivir para ti, Señor.
Despiértame oh si

Estoy desesperado por que te muevas
Dame hambre, acercame mas

Despierta tu poder y toma el control.
Despierta la pasión de vivir para ti.
Quiero vivir para ti
Despierta mi corazón, despierta mi alma
Despierta tu poder y toma el control.
Despierta la pasión de vivir para ti, Señor.
Abre mis ojos para que pueda ver.

Despiértame, porque no puedo vivir
Otro minuto si no estoy brillando tu luz.
Despierta mi corazón, despierta mi alma
Despierta la pasión en mi, oh si
Despiértame
Señor, despiértame para vivir mi destino.

Mal caso de los blues

Que mal caso de los blues.
  
Pensé que serías
Un poco diferente cuando se trata de amarme
Ahora, veo que estaba viviendo un sueño.
Porque todo lo que hago es llorar y despedirme de tu amor.
  
Tengo un mal caso del blues
Es lo que recibo de amarte.
Que mal caso de los blues.
Es lo que recibo de amarte.
  
Pensé que nunca vería
Cómo se siente vivir una vida de miseria.
No tengo nada que esperar
Pero pierda el amor que he perdido y pague el costo del perdedor.
  
Tengo un mal caso del blues
Es lo que recibo de amarte.
Que mal caso de los blues.
Es lo que recibo de amarte.
  
Ahora todo lo que hago es llorar
Y adiós a tu amor, hey.
  
Tengo un mal caso del blues
Es lo que recibo de amarte, nena
Que mal caso de los blues.
Es lo que recibo de amarte.

Dia de doris

Cuando era sólo una niña pequeña
Le pregunté a mi madre, ¿qué voy a ser?
¿Seré bonita, seré rica?
Esto es lo que me dijo.
  
Que Sera, Sera,
Lo que sea sera
El futuro no es algo que podamos ver
Que Sera, Sera
Lo que será será.
  
Cuando era joven me enamoré
Le pregunté a mi amor qué hay por delante.
¿Tendremos arco iris, día tras día?
Esto es lo que dijo mi amor.
  
Que Sera, Sera,
Lo que sea sera
El futuro no es algo que podamos ver
Que Sera, Sera
Lo que será será.
  
Ahora tengo mis propios hijos
Le preguntan a su madre, ¿qué voy a ser?
¿Seré guapo, seré rico?
Les digo con ternura.

Mejor no juntos
Justin Timberlake
----------------
El amor se siente perdido
¿Dónde se encuentra?
Mi corazon todavia esta aqui
Tenemos que dar vueltas y vueltas.
En todo el tiempo
Te estaba amando fielmente
Y te llevaste mi amor
Y me das la vuelta
Ahora no quiero pelear contigo
Tengo todo lo que puedo hacer
No me dejes así, solo quiero a mi chica de vuelta
Déjame resolverlo porque se acabó
¿Que estamos haciendo?
¿Qué podemos ver para resolverlo?
¿Que estamos haciendo?
¿Podemos olvidar de qué se trataba el amor?
Se siente como si estuviera perdiendo, cuando era todo para mí.
Y ahora me doy cuenta.
Solo eran mejores no juntos
Es dificil dejar ir
Chica que mentimos a través de tantas cosas.
Pero para que crezcas, tienes que seguir y levantar tus alas.
Veo tu lágrima, te pones orgullosa del día.
Deberías haberlo sostenido
Cuando me diste mi amor
Ahora no quiero pelear contigo
Tengo todo lo que puedo hacer
Tuvo que dejarlo así, pero mi pensamiento Imma volvió.
Tratamos de resolverlo
Pero se acabó
¿Que estamos haciendo?
¿Qué podemos ver para resolverlo?
¿Que estamos haciendo?
¿Podemos olvidar de qué se trataba el amor?
Se siente como si estuviera perdiendo, cuando era todo para mí.
Y ahora me doy cuenta.
Solo eran mejores no juntos
Chica es demasiado para mí decir
Me dijiste que me amas
Y ahora te veo alejarte
Pero niña como peleas
Es solo la mia
Así lo paso así.
No, que mas decir?
Pero niña sabes que aún te quiero, sí.
¿Que estamos haciendo?
¿Qué podemos ver para resolverlo?
¿Que estamos haciendo?
¿Podemos olvidar de qué se trataba el amor?
Se siente como si estuviera perdiendo, cuando era todo para mí.
Y ahora me doy cuenta.
Solo eran mejores no juntos
Me doy cuenta de
Solo eran mejores no juntos

Melodía de la luna
Noa
----------------
La noche, la noche,
La luna esta mirando
En nuestro pequeño jardín abajo.
  
El jacinto floreciente
En nuestro jardín abunda.
Noche,
La luna esta mirando hacia abajo
  
Y la luna se vuelve hacia las nubes y dice:
¡Dale una pequeña gota de agua a los macizos de flores!
Así el jacinto puede florecer
En nuestro jardín, 'neath the moon.
Noche
La luna esta mirando hacia abajo
  
Las gotas cayeron, golpeadas en mi panel,
Apagó la sed de todas las flores.
Anhelo por la lluvia
Ahora el jacinto puede crecer.
Flores preciosas que se mostrará,
Noche
La luna esta mirando hacia abajo
  
Buenas noches

Niño de la luna
Doncella de hierro
----------------
Siete pecados capitales
Siete maneras de ganar
Siete caminos sagrados al infierno
Y tu viaje comienza
  
Siete bajadas
Siete esperanzas sangrientas
Siete son tus fuegos ardientes
Siete tus deseos
  
Yo soy el que nace menos
El angel caido mirandote
Babilonia, la puta escarlata
Me infiltraré en tu gratitud
No te atrevas a salvar a tu hijo
Mátalo ahora y salva a los jóvenes.
Ser la madre de un bebe estrangulado
Se los propios demonios, Lucifer es mi nombre
  
Moonchild escucha el grito de la mandrágora
Moonchild abre el séptimo sello.
  
Cuento las cabezas de los no nacidos
Los malditos los encontraré a todos.
Y si mueres por tu propia mano.
Como suicida serás condenado.
Y si intentas salvar tu alma.
Te atormentaré, no envejecerás.
Con cada segundo y aliento que pasa.
Estarás tan solo que tu alma se desangrará hasta morir.
  
Moonchild escucha el grito de la mandrágora
Moonchild abre el séptimo sello.
Moonchild pronto serás mío, hijo
Moonchild toma mi mano esta noche
  
Los gemelos están agotados, siete es esta noche.
Géminis se levanta mientras los labios rojos se besan para morder.
Siete ángeles, siete demonios luchan por su alma.
Cuando Gabriel se acuesta a dormir, este niño nació para morir.
  
Uno más muere una vida más
Un bebé llora una madre llora
Por todos los pecados cometerás.
Pedirás perdón y ninguno te lo daré.
Una red de miedo será tu abrigo.
Para vestirte en la noche
Un escape de suerte para ti joven
Pero te veré condenado en la noche interminable.
  
Moonchild escucha el grito de la mandrágora
Moonchild abre el séptimo sello.
Moonchild pronto serás mío, hijo
Moonchild toma mi mano esta noche

Indigo Girls
----------------
Dicen que todo puede ser reemplazado.
Pues bien, la distancia no está cerca.
Recuerdo cada cara
De todos los que me ponen aqui
  
Veo que mi luz brilla
Desde el oeste hacia el este.
Cualquier día de éstos
Cualquier día de éstos
Ya no voy a estar detenido
  
Dicen que todos necesitan protección
Dicen que todos deben caer
Pero juro que veo mi reflejo.
Algunos estaban tan arriba de este muro
Veo que mi luz brilla
Desde el oeste hacia el este.
Cualquier día de éstos
Cualquier día de éstos
Ya no voy a estar detenido
  
De pie junto a mí en esta multitud solitaria
Es un hombre que jura que no tiene la culpa.
Todo el día lo escucho gritar tan fuerte
Que jura que fue enmarcado.
Veo que mi luz brilla
Desde el oeste hacia el este.
Cualquier día de éstos
Cualquier día de éstos
Ya no voy a estar detenido
  
Veo que mi luz brilla
Desde el oeste hacia el este.
Cualquier día de éstos
Cualquier día de éstos
Ya no voy a estar detenido
  
Cualquier día de éstos
Cualquier día de éstos
Ya no voy a estar detenido

Sé yo 4 al día
Michael Jackson
----------------
Así que quieres ver en mi vida
Así que mira pero ten cuidado
No te doy ninguna duda.
Pero eso es doloroso
  
Sé yo 4 al día
Para que puedas entender mi dolor
De que trata todo esto
Y no estoy orgulloso
  
Pero así es como he sobrevivido.
Viviendo en las sombras
Caminando solo en la noche
Fuera de
  
Sé yo 4 al día
Así que puedes ver que no estoy bien
Enfermo y cansado de todo esto.
Pero no voy a empezar.
  
Sé yo 4 ...
Mira como vivo dia a dia
Sé yo 4 ...
Así es como me he convertido en quien soy.
Sé yo 4 al día
Así que puedes ver por ti mismo.
No estoy loco
La prensa es, no yo mi amigo.
  
(Te doy esto por un honor de Michael) A quien todos amamos tanto

Bueno para tu alma
Oingo Boingo
----------------
¿Alguna vez has sentido que de alguna manera
Tu no eras tu
Que tu cuerpo era el mismo
Pero todo a tu alrededor no estaba bien
E imágenes tan extrañas y extrañas.
Inundado en agua furiosa
  
Has estado enamorado
Con alguien a quien apenas conocías
Mientras que cada vez que cierras los ojos,
Viste a esta persona cobrar vida
Te mantuvo despierto por la noche
Te sentiste como si estuvieras quemando
En el dolor, quieres gritar.
Entonces te desmayaste en un sueño.
  
Coro
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
Si no te detienes, perderás el control.
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
  
Todos yacen allí medio dormidos todas las horas de la noche.
Con un demonio molesto tirando de esa pequeña campana
Dentro de tu mente
Cuando de repente esa idea extraña
Irrumpe en una inspiración
Lo agarras y luego
Todo se desliza a través de tus dedos.
  
Coro
  
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
Solo una o dos veces es bueno para tu alma
Es bueno para tu alma
Es bueno para tu alma
Es bueno para tu alma
Es bueno para tu alma

Estás enamorado
Wilson Phillips
----------------
Abre la puerta y entra
Estoy muy contento de verte mi amigo
No se cuanto tiempo ha pasado
Tener esos sentimientos otra vez
Pero ahora veo que eres tan feliz.
Y ooh, simplemente me libera.
Y me gustaría vernos como buenos amigos.
Como solíamos ser
Ah .... mi amor ... ah
  
Estás enamorado
Así debería ser
Porque quiero que seas feliz
Estás enamorado
Y sé que no estás enamorado de mí.
Ooh, es suficiente para mí saber que estás enamorado
Puedo dejarte ir
Porque sé que estás enamorado ...
  
A veces es difícil de creer
Que nunca vuelvas por mi
He tenido este sueño de que siempre estarías a mi lado.
Oh podria haber muerto
Pero ahora veo que eres tan feliz.
Y ooh, simplemente me libera.
Y me gustaría vernos como buenos amigos.
Como solíamos ser
Ah .... mi amor ... ah
  
Estás enamorado
Así debería ser
Porque quiero que seas feliz
You're In Love  
And I know that you're not in love with me  
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that You're In Love  
I can let you go  
'Cause I know that You're In Love...  
  
I tried to find you but you were so far away  
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me  
Someday, someday, someday...  
Ooh, You're In Love  
  
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that You're In Love  
Now I'll let you go  
'Cause I know that You're In Love...No  
No, No, No, No, No, No, No.. Ooh...

Letter From Death Row
Poison
----------------
Sitting here in my cell writing a letter  
Thanking all the people who made my living conditions better  
  
And thanks to the justice system  
I'm making a million  
My lawyer got me a book deal  
Now I'm making a killing just from making a killing  
  
I got an agent for the publicity  
An accountant to count my royalties  
The talk shows want me, sorry I can't go  
I'm stuck here on death row  
  
You call me hannibal lechter, if I was smarter  
If I was charlie manson you'd make me a martyr wouldn't ya  
You'd call me a handsome man if I was bundy  
But if I looked like john wayne gasey you'd just say I'm funny, not ha ha
gracioso
  
Chorus:  
Tried to act my career just flopped  
Killed my neighbor, got on cops  
Problem is, I only made one show now  
I'm stuck here on death row  
  
The poor victim's families never make a dime  
Networks say I'm not prime time  
All my cell mates on my cell block  
Say I'm the hottest topic at the coffee shops  
  
Waitress cries, "god how they should free me"  
Send me her love letters, says someday she'd really love to meet me  
Tells her customers people should forgive me for the things I do  
I wonder if I kill her would her family forgive me too?  
  
Chorus  
Thanks for the attention and the publicity  
The taxpayer's dollars that you spend on me  
Thanks for the good meal, dry bed, and these warm clothes  
I'm alive and well on death row

I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good
Carly Simon
----------------
Though folks with good intentions  
Tell me to save my tears  
Well I'm so mad about him  
I can't live without him  
  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I've got it bad  
And that ain't good  
  
My poor heart is so sentimental  
Not made of wood  
I've got it so bad  
And that ain't good  
  
But when the fish are jumpin'  
And Friday rolls around  
My man an' I, we gin some  
We pray some, and sin some  
  
He don't love me like I love him  
The way he should  
I've got it bad  
And that ain't good  
Yes I've got it bad  
And that ain't good

He Made The Difference
Indiana Bible College
----------------
Verse 1  
If it wasn't for the Lord, where would I be?  
My life was nothing until He set me free.  
What a change He made in my life,  
No more compromising the wrong for the right.  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life.  
  
Chorus  
I don't walk like I used to walk,  
He made the difference.  
I don't talk like I used to talk,  
He made the difference.  
I don't live like I used to live,  
He made the difference.  
I don't give like I used to give,  
He made the difference.  
He made the difference,  
He made the difference in my life.  
  
Verse 2  
He gives me joy that cannot be surpassed,  
I'm on a cloud from the first moment to the last  
He walks with me, talks with me,  
Telling me I'm His own.  
He calms all my fears,  
Telling me I am not alone.  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life  
  
Vamp 1  
What a change  
  
Vamp 2  
I'm glad about it

Huck's Tune
Bob Dylan
----------------
Well I wandered alone,  
Through a desert of stone,  
And I dreamed of my future wife.  
My sword's in my hand,  
And I'm next in command,  
In this version of Death called Life.  
My plate and my cup,  
Are right straight up,  
I took a rose from the hand of a child.  
When I kiss your lips,  
The honey drips,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Every day we meet,  
On any old street,  
And you're in your girlish prime.  
The short and the tall,  
Are coming to the ball,  
I go there all the time.  
Behind every tree,  
There's something to see,  
The river is wider than a mile.  
I tried you twice,  
You can't be nice,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Here come the nurse,  
With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.  
You push it all in,  
And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

System Of A Down

Making two possibilities a reality,  
Predicting the future of things we all know,  
Fighting off the diseased programming  
Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries  
  
Science fails to recognize the single most  
Potent element of human existence  
Letting the reigns go to the unfolding  
Is faith, faith, faith, faith  
  
Science has failed our world  
Science has failed our Mother Earth

[Hook: Snoop Dogg] x2  
Baby, I come running  
Baby, come running  
Just keep me coming  
And I come running  
Cause I'm your dog  
Baby I'm your dog  
So whenever you call  
I come running  
  
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]  
You ain't listenin'  
So you can talk to me  
Don't listen to him  
A body like that ain't hard to feed  
Cause girl I'll eat you up  
All in a couple of seconds  
Girl I'll eat you up  
It's when you realize you're in Heaven  
Like how'd you get there?  
Baby what you doin' in this chair?  
Couldn't let you sit there  
You need help, somebody should get there  
You see girl, time is like money  
Both of which men loathe  
Spend them both with me  
And then for sure you'll know  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]  
She's impressed by a fat boy  
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy  
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy  
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it  
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it  
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard  
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it  
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force  
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs  
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job  
Dog pound niggas, and we came to fight  
I was several million up before it came to light  
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it  
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music  
Smoked out like a player and you know the name  
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]  
I got... Rottweiler in tube sock  
Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die  
Boxer... you take mine off then hallelujah  
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times  
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s  
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we  
Should tone it... down with the clean version  
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin  
I like it... make me realize my vices  
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates  
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom  
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room  
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'ma cum in first place  
I'ma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place  
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree  
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho

And everybody momma (haha)  
Here we go... listen listen

I remember Saturday mornin's  
Me wakin' up to momma in the kitchen cookin' to Sam Cook and  
I was just a young dude, watchin' mornin' cartoons, waitin' for momma to braid
mi pelo
I used to hate to get it done, cause she'd braid it too tight  
My momma always gave a style she knew I would like, and then  
I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch  
While me and Rob played ball  
  
[Bridge]  
Momma always did little things like that  
Momma always will know I love her for that  
For all the things that you used to do...  
Momma I dedicate this one to you

From every tour, every show  
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go  
Momma Ima sing this one to you, momma let me sing this one to you  
  
[Verse 2]  
She's like the mother of Tappahannock, VA  
Everybody knew miss Joyce, where we stayed  
All heads said she was cool, nothing' that she wouldn't do  
But about CB, she was know to act a fool (whoawhoa)  
With the little money that she made  
She took the bed and made it all okay  
Night at the daycare, when we had to stay there  
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now  
  
[Bridge]  
Momma always did little things like that (oh)  
Momma always will know (aye) I love her for that  
For all the things that you used to do...  
Momma I dedicate this one to you  
  
Sing with the song of Chris Brown, Mama lyrics!

Momma I thank you for all you've done (oo'oo)  
I thank God everyday I'm your son (oh)

But lovin' me unconditionally...  
Everybody say... "M-O-M-M-A"  
Everybody say... momma

Some Things That Glitter
Queen
----------------
Once I loved a butterfly  
Don't wonder how, don't ask me why  
But I believed what I'd been told  
All things that glitter can't be gold, ooh yeah  
All things that glitter can't be gold  
Those jealous minds conspired to say  
Just let that creature fly away  
How can it be she has it all?  
Her pride is headed for a fall, ooh yeah  
All things that glitter can't be gold  
Oh Lord, what races we run  
Seeking our place in the sun  
Reaching and hoping  
We'll find the right one  
Now every day a new joy waits  
My butterfly grew golden wings  
It seems we find as we grow old  
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold  
So let us mind what's there to see  
Before our hearts become too cold  
In spite of all that we've been told  
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold

Which one of you, has got to be so sad for,  
And what'd ya look ashamed about,  
Always on downer,that just sounds like you.  
And your waiting for some things to jump out of that tree,

I had to ask mister fix it,  
Everybody on this stagecoach likes robbin' an' bashin'  
  
Big blacks and blonds smokin' miles and miles of hash,  
That's sweet,  
The bigger the tree the better the time.  
Yeah I can see now, how your looking for someone still,  
  
A lot more funkier,a lot more oh,  
Well that's the way it seems is what the way you are.  
(Don't know this bit), and a roof drops in,  
  
And said hello goodbyes and a few months later your mine,  
At this rate even sooner,  
Still a lot more funkier, still a lot more you.

All Up
Ocean Colour Scene
----------------
Spark and Cindy live by their own means  
They wouldn't have if I only  
Know'd where they'd been  
And I want to make things a part of my life  
And I want to see that  
Things are going to be right  
But if you can't even  
Stand on your feet  
And if you don't own the  
Air that you breathe  
Then it's not for me to say  
  
But I wouldn't live that way  
And I wouldn't stand apart  
And I wouldn't find the real  
And I wouldn't play a part  
And I wouldn't find in love  
So misguided by some fool  
And just what I'm trying t say  
Makes my head spin round the room  
  
(Repeats from 3rd line onwards)

Hazard
Richard Marx
----------------
"My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven  
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes  
That boy's not right  
Three years ago when I came to know Mary  
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies  
And saw the man inside  
  
We used to walk down by the river  
She loved to watch the sun go down  
We used to walk along the river  
And dream our way out of this town  
  
No one understood what I felt for Mary  
No one cared until the night she went out walking alone  
And never came home  
Man with a badge came knocking next morning  
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly  
Pointed right at me  
  
I swear I left her by the river  
I swear I left her safe and sound  
I need to make it to the river  
And leave this old Nebraska town  
  
I think about my life gone by  
And how it's done me wrong  
There's no escape for me this time  
All of my rescues are gone, long gone  
  
I swear I left her by the river  
I swear I left her safe and sound  
I need to make it to the river  
And leave this old Nebraska town

Jesus In A Camper Van
Robbie Williams
----------------
Ooh we've got a live one, featherweight icon  
Heroes let 'im down so he sleeps with the  
Light on  
And there's nothin' left to do but kneel down  
And pray  
Sail away with Caesar if you're a non believer  
Everybody get high if you're a  
Diamond geezer  
It's the devil that needs ya so go out and play  
  
Blame yourself it's easier  
There's no need to trouble her you trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Especially when he goes round  
Saying I am the way  
  
And now it's four in the mornin' yes yes y'all in  
No one can shoot but everybody's scoring  
Trust me it's boring get down and pray  
  
They told you not to meddle with the bass and the treble  
There's dust on your needle and you think that  
You're a rebel  
  
You're Evel Knievel so get down and pray  
Blame yourself it's easier  
There's no need to trouble her you trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Especially when he goes round  
Saying I am the way  
  
I am the way, I am the way, I am the way  
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the way  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
  
Blame yourself it's easier  
There's no need to trouble her  
Blame yourself it's easier  
There's no need to trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he says sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Jesus in a camper van he says sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes

Nightwish
----------------
Oh, setting Sun,  
Thy red rays maketh me cry.  
They remind me of the one  
Whose love awaits me in the sky.  
  
A bridal bed awaits us both  
After the landscape of death I cross.  
Before my sorrows I must die,  
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.  
  
The voice of nightly winds has awakened me,  
Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.  
Beneath my dreams and wishes  
I long for thy caresses.  
  
A bridal bed awaits us both,  
After the landscape of death I cross.  
Before my sorrows I must die,  
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky.  
  
"Passed away in silence  
The flute from the realm unseen  
Empties it's heart  
Making love to me  
With it's enchanting melody.  
Light of Orion,  
Shadow of Andromeda,  
Call of the dancing Universe.  
Their love I must enter  
Before thou can blame my soul  
That is peace"

Understanding
Xscape

What I need from you is understanding  
How can we communicate  
If you don't here what I say  
What I need from you is understanding  
So simple as 1,2,3  
Understanding is what I need  
  
You don't even know me  
You just wanna do what you wanna do  
That's not the way it should be no  
You should listen to me, boy  
I tried so very hard to make you understand  
But the chooses you make  
Baby they're all demands oh  
  
I tried so very hard  
To keep our love alive  
But you don't wanna meet me half way  
Then the understanding dies  
  
There's no way that we can work it out  
If we don't pull together  
I don't mean to be demanding  
I want some understanding  
I wanna be with you  
  
What I need from you is understanding  
How can we communicate  
If you don't here what I say  
What I need from you is understanding  
So simple as 1,2,3  
Understanding is what I need  
  
I listen to you baby  
And I know the things your going through  
I try to understand,  
That's why i'm still with you baby  
See everyday we're living  
There's one thing that'll always be unsure  
That's why I need you baby, pleading baby  
Please let our love endure  
  
I tried so very hard  
To keep our love alive  
But you don't wanna meet me half way  
Then the understanding dies  
  
There's no way that we can work it out  
If we don't pull together  
I don't mean to be demanding  
I want some understanding  
I wanna be with you

All need is understanding  
How ow ow ow  
If you don't here what I say  
Can't you see baby  
  
I tried so very hard  
To keep our love alive  
But you don't wanna meet me half way  
Then the understanding dies  
  
There's no way that we can work it out  
If we don't pull together

Pushover
Etta James
----------------
So you told all the boys that you were gonna take me out  
  
Ya even ya even had the nerve to make a bet a yes you did  
That I, I would give in all of my love you would win  
But you haven't, you haven't won it yet  
You took me for a pushover  
Oh you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa I'm not a pushover  
You thought my love was easy to get  
  
All of the girls think you're fine  
They even call ya Romeo  
Ya got 'em, yeah you got 'em runnin' to and fro  
Yes ya have  
But I don't want a one night thrill  
I want a love that's for real  
And I can tell by your line, your's is not the lasting kind  
  
You took me for a pushover  
Oh you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa I'm not a pushover  
You thought that you could change my mind  
Your temptin' lips (mmm hmm) your way hair (oh yeah)  
Your pretty eyes with that (ahhh) come hither stare  
It makes me weak and I, I start to bend  
And then I stop and think again  
No (no), no (no), no don't let yourself go  
  
I hate to spoil your reputation  
I want true love not an imitation  
And I'm hip to every word in your conversation  
  
Who took me for a pushover  
Whoa I'm not a pushover  
Whoa you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa you can't (push me over)  
Nobody is gonna (push me over)  
Oh you're not man enough to (push me over)  
Everybody thought you was gonna (push me over)

Moon Over Madness
Gino Vannelli
----------------
There she lies, a vision in the dark  
Invader of my heart  
Look at me, behaving like a fool possessed  
Damned if I'll be doomed  
By this woman 'neath the moon over madness  
Shall I kiss the mouth, stroke the hair  
Undress her - do I dare  
Or bite into the vein above her heaving breast  
Ah, the sun best come up soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
And when I see her face  
The tuft of hair beneath the lace  
I feel the fire of mortal men  
As she draws a languorous breath  
So full of life, so close to death  
I'm filled with wild revenge  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I fight my heart no more  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
What I'd give to know just what I am  
A monster or a man  
An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh  
One of which is in this room  
Wondering 'neath the mood over madness  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I end this lonely war  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
Woman won't you hold me in your arms  
Before you come to harm  
And take this tender love and drive it through my chest  
Stike hard, do it soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
My madness  
Over you

Morning Please Don't Come
Dusty Springfield
----------------
Morning please don't come  
Surely you see that my lover is sleeping  
Morning please don't come  
Let the night linger on  
When the stars have left the sky  
We must say fond goodbye  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please don't come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please don't come  
Day don't break for you will take  
My love away from me  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  
Sing sweet nightingale  
Sing me a song of a night never-ending  
Sing sweet nightingale  
And I'll try to pretend  
That tomorrow's nowhere near  
And there's nothing to fear  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please don't come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please don't come  
Day don't break for you will take  
My love away from me  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come

A Beautiful Story
Cher
----------------
What's your name is it Jane  
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool?  
It's just I tired of wasting my hours  
Talking to trees and watching flowers grow  
Watching birds chasing bees  
Little boys scraping knees  
Even my tears have all dried  
Can I sit by your side?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't misunderstand me  
I'm just an old man with no place to go  
And if you oblige me and sit here beside me  
I'll tell you a story a beautiful story  
That you might not know Please don't go  
  
Pardon me mister tree  
I hope I didn't offend you before  
You are my friend but I wanted much more  
But now I'm back once again  
Like always before  
Watching birds chasing bees  
Little boys scraping knees  
Even my tears have all dried  
Can I sit by your side?  
  
[Chorus]

Life Of Leaving Home
Yellowcard
----------------
I can see all the footsteps left behind every second I gave.  
Every song was a snapshot of my life I needed something to say.  
  
It started out in the last slow motion scene watching everyone change.  
Made a map of the one way road from here, I had no reason to stay.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
Think of me when the stars come out tonight, take a look at the sky.  
I never said I could burn out that bright, but I needed to try.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
The day that I found my voice, I knew that I had no choice.  
The only way that I'd ever learn to love is if i found it on my own.  
On my own.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
On my own (on my own) On my own (on my own)  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.

I'm a West Side with rackn', in the back whats happenin'  
40 Glock, snap a Insta, ain't no need for no caption  
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage  
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it  
Homie threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!  
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest  
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect  
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect, woo!  
That's how I got put on  
Tree Top Piru, yeah I got put on  
It was hard in the hood  
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood  
I know Game from cedar block, Dom from the West  
That was [?] and Pac, what's his name and his chest  
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on

I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'  
'Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence  
That's a principle of proof, the definition of logic  
That this nigga is a bitch  
Every chance he get, he dogdin'  
Brought back this West Coast shit and this the motherfuckin' thanks I get  
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit  
They brought him more cases in jail, but a nigga ain't snitch  
That's how it's s'posed to go down  
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down  
You a blind date, have my bitch pick you up  
Then have one of my top members stick you up  
I know Nipsey from 60-0, C-Hood from 10-4  
Tony Bone from 40 Crips, that's my kinfolk  
My whole family tried to set me but it didn't work  
Momma know I been bangin' lately nigga

Long Away
Queen
----------------
You might believe in heaven  
I would not care to say  
For every star in heaven  
There's a sad soul here today  
Wake up in the morning with a good face  
Stare at the moon all day  
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase  
Does anyone care anyway  
For all the prayers in heaven  
So much of life's this way  
  
Did we leave our way behind us  
Such a long long way behind us  
Who knows when now who knows where  
Where the light of day will find us  
Look for the day  
  
Take heart my friend we love you  
Though it seems like you're alone  
A million light's above you  
Smile down upon your home  
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase  
Come let the new child play  
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase  
I'm leaving here,I'm long away  
For all the stars in heaven  
I would not live I could not live this way  
  
Did we leave our way behind us  
Such a long long way behind us  
Leave it for some hopeless lane  
Such a long long way such a long long way  
Such a long long way I'm looking for  
Still looking for that day

Was It Worth It?
Pet Shop Boys
----------------
Well I don't know why I was dreaming about you  
But I do know that I was dancing without you  
Then you smiled, and I was lost  
You fall in love, why count the cost?  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
Was it worth it?  
Yes it's worth living for  
Was it worth it?  
Yes it's worth giving more  
  
If I'd had my way this would have happened much sooner  
But until that day it was only a rumour  
All at once you changed my life  
And led me in to paradise  
  
Where I had to do  
What I wanted to  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I reserve the right to live  
My life this way, and I don't give  
A damn when I hear people say  
I'll pay the price that others pay  
  
Because it's worth it  
Yes it's worth living for  
Because it's worth it  
Yes it's worth living for  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I reserve (what?)  
The right to live (where?)  
My life this way (how?)  
I couldn't give  
A damn when I (what?)  
Hear people say (who?)  
I'll pay the price  
That others pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know why  
I never thought I'd fall in love  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I never thought I'd fall in love  
I don't know why  
I don't know why

Barefoot Ballad
Elvis Presley
----------------
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad  
Won't you play for me a down home country song  
'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off  
With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong  
  
Give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle and a melody  
Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey mountain  
  
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad  
Won't you play for me a down home country song  
'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off  
With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong  
  
Now the big toe's connected to the two toe  
And the two toe's connected to the three toe  
And the three toe's connected to the four toe  
And the four toe's connected to the five toe  
And the five toe and away we go

I got a lust for life  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
Here comes Johnny Yen again  
With the liquor and drugs  
And the flesh machine  
He's gonna do another striptease  
Hey man where'd you get  
That lotion? Your skin starts  
Itching once you buy the gimmick  
About something called love  
Oh love love love  
That's like hypnotizing chickens  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
Got a lust for life  
Yeah a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Oh a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Yeah a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
A lust for life  
Lust for life, lust for life

We Damn The Night
Helloween
----------------
Blood in my pillow  
Blood in my skin  
Am I going mad  
Or was this a dream?  
There in the depth  
The hollow souls wait  
Voices surround me  
Tempting my fate  
Then out of nowhere  
Figures in white  
Guarding my soul in the fight  
  
We are strong we re'alive  
We have faith in his might  
We believe in the everlasting light  
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there  
We will fight for what's just and what's right  
We damn the night  
  
Out in the blackness  
Shivering cold  
Doubt takes on shape  
Fear the unknown  
Eyes of the fallen  
Piercing their glance  
Whispers of doom  
Left without chance  
Then out of nowhere  
Figures in white  
Shield my soul in the fight  
  
We're strong, we're alive  
We have faith in his might  
We believe in the everlasting light  
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there  
We will fight for what's just and what's right  
We damn the night  
  
We're strong, we're alive  
We have faith in his might  
We believe in the everlasting light  
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there  
We will fight for what's just and what's right  
We damn the night  
We damn the night  
We damn the night

I'm A Winner
Diana Ross
----------------
I roll the dice  
Seven eleven  
You'll either take me down  
Or you'll take me to heaven  
And I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
I said I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
My friends all say  
He don't play by the rules  
So listen  
Don't you be no fool  
Don't you know, you're just a beginner  
So look at me now  
I'm a winner  
I'm a winner  
Yes, I am  
She's a winner  
Yeah, yes I am  
She's a winner  
Like a roulette wheel  
Spinning around in my head  
I put my chips on nine  
Gamblin' you'd be mine  
And I'm so glad  
I took a chance on you baby  
Say I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
My friends all say  
We just don't understand it  
You play this game  
You'll come out empty handed  
'Cause here we arrange her  
And then shortchange her  
But I fooled them, y'all  
I'm a winner  
I'm a winner  
Yes I am  
She's a winner  
Yes I am  
Put that money down  
And put 'dem chips on nine  
I'm a gambling girl  
And I give all I got  
So I am at your love  
And I hit the jackpot  
And I'm so glad  
I took a chance on you baby  
I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
I'm a winner  
Yes I am  
I'm a winner  
Yes I am

Even If
Lea Salonga
----------------
All those sleepless nights  
All the tears I cried  
All the pain I kept inside  
I kept asking myself why  
You had to say goodbye  
  
Was it just a dream  
When you said to me  
That there is someone new in your life  
You could have at least lied  
The truth just scared me  
  
Even if...  
You mean the whole damn world to me  
I can forget you  
Wait and see  
I can be strong even without you  
I can't waste my life forever  
Hoping you'd come back to me  
But deep inside  
I know I'll be waiting here for you  
  
Even if...  
You mean the whole damn world to me  
I can forget you  
Wait and see  
I can be strong even without you  
I can't waste my life forever  
Hoping you'd come back to me  
But deep inside  
I know I'll be waiting here for you

Well I lay my head on the railroad tracks  
Waitin for the double E  
But railroad don't run no more  
Poor poor pitiful me

Poor poor pitiful me  
These young girls won't let me be

She really worked me over good  
She was just like Jesse James  
She really worked me over good  
She was a credit to her gender  
She put me through some changes lord  
Sort of like a Waring blender

These young girls won't let me be  
Lord have mercy on me  
Woe, is me  
  
Well O met a girl at the rainbow bar  
She asked me if I'd beat her  
And she took me back to the Hyatt house  
I don't want to talk about it

Whoo!  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Hot little mamma(faint)  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Whoo hoo!

Christmas In California
America
----------------
Oh, look out kids it's that time of year  
When ole Santa's on his way  
Don't look now but the top is down  
On his candy apple sleigh  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in his hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California, wo-oh  
  
The boulevard, lights of red and green  
As the snow birds make the scene  
Hollywood doesn't miss a beat  
It's another childhood dream  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time for sure  
In California  
  
People say it can't be true  
That the spirit lives here, too  
But you'll find Christmas everywhere  
Under palm trees, sun and moon - ah  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
In California  
In California, wo-oh

China Town Shuffle
Grateful Dead
----------------
Take it, you can have it  
What I got, baby, I can't hold  
If you find the secret  
Tell me how to build the mold  
And I can't handle your problems  
Don't try to handle mine  
Get yourself a shotgun, a pocketful of shells  
While away the time  
Get it right, do it nice  
If you make a mistake, pay for it twice  
But if you need it, got to have it  
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home  
Look up the wall, you know you gotta call  
Before you start calling, be ready to fall  
And if you fall in my direction  
Don't expect no help at all  
Get it right, do it nice  
If you make a mistake, pay for it twice  
And if you need it, got to have it  
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home  
Look up the wall, you know you gotta call  
Before you start calling, be ready to fall  
And if you fall in my direction  
Don't expect no help at all  
Don't expect no help at all  
Don't expect no help at all  
And if you fall in my direction  
Don't expect no help at all

Oooohh oooohhh  
  
  
Momma take this badge off of me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:

I can't shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is coming down  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door

Brooklyn Night
Lady Gaga
----------------
[Verse 1]  
I always thought it was you,  
You always thought it was me.  
We always thought we were it,  
Seemed like a real perfect fit,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
I always thought even though,  
We were so young we could grow.  
Up in the end it'd be us,  
We'd take the F or the bus,  
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I miss our cheap chandalier  
'Member when dad hung it there?  
And we would watch Rocky IV,  
The one where the Russian scored,  
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair.  
  
I'd call you my champion  
Thought we had already won  
And cracked open our last beer,  
Falling asleep in our tears,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Bridge]  
I found an old pair of  
Keys in my purse that opened  
The walkup we shared  
How did they get there, jerk?  
I wanna see you there  
I wanna make it work.  
  
I didn't brush my hair  
And my lashes are falling  
Off of seven years  
Of our bad luck dating.  
I want one last night there,  
A Brooklyn Night affair.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Outro]  
Its not that I don't want to love you  
Cause I really tried, and I  
Just wanna hang with the old you  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu.  
  
Have a drink with your former self  
We both won't act like someone else  
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu

1 2!  
  
I Just Want to feel you up with such dread  
Let you suck it out let you suck it out  
Till I'm dry and dead  
Now I've got love flowin in my nightmare girls  
Caffeine Cold Caffeine Cold and I can't see shit  
  
Don't breathe life in to the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
Don't breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
  
Now I smell like cigarettes  
Cause I love to breathe your smoke  
I smell like alcohol  
Cause I drink to believe in more  
  
I have 3 drinks  
Before I even start to count  
I think I'm gonna move  
Way down south  
  
Don't breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
Don't breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
  
"I'm not a monster  
Just really fucked up  
I'm tired  
I'll see you in hell  
Are you judging me?  
Don't laugh at me  
Don't laugh at me  
No seriously don't laugh at me  
It's not funny  
I'm not joking  
It's not funny  
I'm not laughing"

Well you burn back baby now what can I do  
And all of that jive that your good friend's been sellin'

Everybody tells me you're bein' so cruel  
Everybody tells me but I don't believe it babe

Love Me Now
John Legend
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Pulling me further, further than I've been before  
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core  
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars  
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours  
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, I want you to love me now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed  
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no  
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to
bueno
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall
aparte
  
[Chorus]  
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?  
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
And I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh  
Love me now  
Love me now, love me now  
Love me now  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright  
Let's make the most of every moment tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh  
Love me now, love me now  
Love you now  
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh

Born To Lose
George Jones
----------------
Born to lose I've lived my life in vein  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear  
How I long to always have you near  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose my every hope is gone  
It's so hard to face an empty dawn  
You were all the happiness I knew  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Transatlantic
Starship
----------------
3000 miles across the sea, are you waiting there for me  
I'm stuck here in this state, so I must communicate  
Don't know just where you are, just know that you're too far  
There's only one thing I can do  
  
Chorus:  
Gonna send my love to you (Transatlantic)  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency (Transatlantic)  
Send it E.S.P.  
  
through the static in the air, I will transmit that I care  
Do you read me loud and clear, yes that's my heartbeat that you hear  
No phone no radio, the telegram's too slow  
I'm going crazy without you  
  
Gonna send my love to you (Transatlantic)  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency (Transatlantic)  
Send it E.S.P.  
  
S.O.S, in distress  
Close my eyes for your reply  
Do you read me  
Will you reach me  
  
Transistor tube and microchip  
Won't bring me closer to your lips  
Send a kiss out through the night  
Like a laser beam of light  
No underwater train, no supersonic rain  
Is fast enough to get to you  
  
Gonna send my love to you (Transatlantic)  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency (Transatlantic)  
  
Will you  
Will you read me  
Send my love (Transatlantic)  
I want to know  
Do you read me

That's Just Me
Tim McGraw
----------------
Well I was southern born and raised on the Good Book  
My old boots are worn from the hard roads I took  
And I'm proud to be my daddy's son  
And momma taught me how to work and not to quit  
Until the job's done  
Well I may not be high society but I got all I need  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me  
  
Well I got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one  
Well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun  
We live out in the country where we're free to roam  
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home  
Well it's the life I live and the air I breathe  
  
The way I believe  
  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me  
  
Yeah they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me

Of All The Gin Joints In All The World
Fall Out Boy
----------------
You only hold me up like this  
'Cause you don't know who I really am  
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you  
We're making out inside crashed cars  
We're sleeping through all our memories  
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive (now I only waste my time
dreaming of you)  
  
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness  
All of our moves make up for the silence  
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase  
Like I'll never be the same  
  
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you  
I'm not trying  
You only hold me up like this

Take me with you where you goin'?  
Oh daddy, please  
Come find the time, come watch us growin'  
Oh daddy, please  
Don't leave there's so much that we want to know before you go  
Well I'm in need of someone to tie my shoes  
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Oh daddy, please  
I pray every night the doors will open  
Oh daddy, please  
This house is just a broken home  
Left all alone  
Well I'm in need of someone to tie my shoes  
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Let me tell you 'bout  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Oh daddy, no

Daddy please  
Don't you hear me  
Don't run away  
Our father

Our father  
Far farther away  
Far father

You'll Never Walk Alone
Andy Williams
----------------
There's a certain sound always follows me around When you're close to me you
will hear it It's the sound that lovers hear when they discover There could be
no other for their love It's my happy heart you hear Singing loud and singing
clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my happy heart away
Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love Feeling
more and more like I've never felt before You have changed my life so
completely Music fills my soul now, I've lost all control now I'm not half,
I'm whole now with your love It's my happy heart you hear Singing loud and
singing clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my happy heart
away Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love It's
my happy heart you hear Singing loud and singing clear And it's all because
you're near me, my love Take my happy heart away Let me love you night and day
In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love It's my happy heart you hear Singing
loud and singing clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my
happy heart away Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh
mi amor

Baby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow
Vonda Shepard
----------------
I like the way you wanted me  
Every night for so long baby  
I like the way you needed me  
Every time things got rocky  
  
I was believing in you  
Am I mistaken do you say,  
Do you say what you mean  
I want our love to last forever  
  
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
  
I like the way you'd hold me  
Every night for so long baby  
And I like the way you'd say my name  
In the middle of the night  
While you were sleeping  
  
I was believing in you  
Was I mistaken  
Do you mean, mean what you say  
When you say our love could last forever  
  
Well I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
  
You would run around and lead me on forever  
While I wait at home thinking that we're together  
I wanted our love to last forever  
  
Well I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Believe In Love
Scorpions

How does it fell babe  
To taste sweet revenge  
Do you want me on my knees  
How does it feel babe  
  
To let me feel your strength  
Don't be cruel, can't you see  
If you don't catch me now  
I can't stop falling down  
  
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul  
I need your love babe don't tell me "no way"  
Babe I miss you so much more than words can say  
  
How does it feel babe  
To kill our destiny  
I swear I'm not gonna crawl oh no  
How does it feel babe  
  
To make a fool out of me  
How can you be so cold  
If you don't catch me now  
I can't stop falling down  
  
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul  
I need your love babe don't treat me this way  
Ooh I miss you, I miss you  
  
Baby our love's got what it takes  
To give us one more chance to start once again  
Baby our love will find a way  
As long as we believe in love

Come The Morning
Hank Snow
----------------
I sit upon the bed in my rented room and watch  
The broken shadows from the street lights playing tag upon the wall  
Down the street a neon light is reaching out to mock the night  
And all the little fears that darkness brings.  
  
The smoke of my last cigarette still hangs upon the air and yet  
I reach to light another from the pack that's nearly gone  
And the dawn seems a million miles away but all the while  
  
Down in the trainyard the graveyard shift had just come on  
And turned their ragged collars against the drizzling rain  
Back and forth the yard engine goes about the pulling out  
The railroad cars that soon will be making up the train  
That's gonna be come the morning.  
  
I wonder if I ever cross the mind of someone  
That I might have learned to love  
Had I ever chose to try  
Or did she fail to think about me in the lonely nights without me  
Was she the last to care if I should live or die.  
  
I've been a nameless ghost that rides the empty wave of memory  
In the dark deserted closets of the mind of someone else  
And now I'm a ghost unto myself but still I know.  
  
And now I cross the room and stand before the open window  
And reach out to touch the rain that's slowly falling on my hand  
The pavement hot and cold below looks back at me and seems to know  
It ends without a tear without a smile.  
  
And in those last brief seconds could it be I was mistaken  
Or did I hear a voice somewhere that softly called my name  
Or was it just a whistle of a train for all the while  
  
Down in the trainyard the graveyard shift had just gone home  
To hang their clothes to dry them bar their doors against the rain  
The yard engine breathe a sigh Then pulls a last grey coal car by  
Then moves aside to look with pride Upon the new born train  
That I won't take come the morning.  
  
I wonder if I ever cross the mind of someone  
That I might have learned to love  
Had I ever chose to try  
Or did she fail to think about me in the lonely nights without me  
Was she the last to care if I should live or die...

Starlight
Helloween
----------------
You're hanging around and got nuthin' to do  
You want to get out some pills in front of you  
You fly on invisivble wings  
Be careful my friend for too many can kill  
You say that the meaning of life's in those pills  
You forget all earthly things  
  
You swallow your pill you want to feel free  
A trip to a world made of games  
You do it again yet it's never the same  
But a junkie's not somethin' to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Starlight! Fallin' in deep through your eyes!  
Starlight! Shinin' down for your soul to arise!  
  
Now there's a needle lying in front of you  
I'm frightened of those things  
But I'll know what you'll do  
You need it to escape from the night, ha ha  
You ride on through heaven you don't feel no pain  
You ride on and ride on again and again  
On the needle that brings you the light  
  
You feel the mind-blowin' stuff  
Flow through your veins  
You take off and fly to the sun  
But when you get too near your wings will be burnt  
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall

She Knows
Thin Lizzy
----------------
Who's got the funk  
When you're feeling low down  
Who's going to love you  
When there's no one else around  
  
Who's going to help you  
Especially when you're sick  
Loving Mary  
I need you quick  
  
She knows and she gives her everything  
She knows and she can do her thing  
She knows and she tries her best  
She knows, oh, you know she knows  
  
Who's got the junk  
When you're feeling low down  
Who's going to give  
When there's none to go around  
  
Who's going to help you  
When you feel you've had enough  
Mother Mary  
This child, this rose  
  
But loving Mary  
Do you feel the pain?  
I'm falling down  
And I can't get up again  
  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
Just a striped guitar reaction  
  
Who's going to help you  
Especially when you're ill  
Loving Mary  
I hope you will  
  
But loving Mary  
Do you feel the pain?  
I'm falling down  
And I can't get up again  
  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
  
Mother Mary, is there nothing you can do?

The Overload
Talking Heads
----------------
A terrible signal  
Too weak to even recognize  
A gentle collapsing  
The removal of the insides  
  
I'm touched by your pleas  
I value these moments  
We're order than we realize  
...in someone's eyes  
  
A frequent returning  
And leaving unnoticed  
A condition of mercy  
A change in the weather  
  
A view to remember  
The center is missing  
They question how the future lies  
...in someone's eyes  
The gentle collapsing  
Of every surface  
We travel on the quiet road  
...the overload

One More Go Round
James Taylor
----------------
Workin' on a thing, workin' on a thing,  
Funny little thing I know,  
Sure got to like it.  
Only thing I got to show you,  
Running around the room  
In my Fruit O' The Loom,  
A cup of coffee from King Tut's tomb.  
Save me, Lumalammalu  
Sure enough I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus  
To miss the first half of the show.  
Oh, It gets to the end,  
We get to run it again  
Just like before,  
One more go round.  
  
Drank myself some wine back in '69,  
I was fooling around with my friends  
In my spare time.  
Life along the river,  
Knobby little knees in the Summer breeze,  
Hammock and a couple of trees,  
Swing low, if you please.  
Oh, I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus,  
I missed the whole half of the show.  
Come to the end  
And they run it again,  
Same as before,  
One more go round.  
  
After all this time of fooling around  
It and never having nothing to show,  
Yeah, I'm happy to say  
That I finally found it  
Right underneath my own nose.  
Oh, I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus,  
I missed the first half of the show.  
Please don't let it end,  
I want it again  
Just like before,  
One more go round.

Kisapmata
Erik Santos
----------------
Nitong umaga lang, Pagka-lambing-lambing  
Ng iyong mga matang  
Hayup kung tumingin  
Nitong umaga lang, Pagka-galing-galing  
Ng iyong sumpang  
Walang aawat sa atin  
  
Chorus  
O kay bilis namang maglaho ng pag-ibig mo sinta  
Daig mo pa ang isang kisapmata  
Kanina'y nariyan lang o ba't bigla namang nawala  
Daig mo pa ang isang kisapmata  
  
Kani-kanina lang  
Pagka-ganda-ganda ng pagkasabi mong  
Sana'y tayo na nga  
Kani-kanina lang, Pagka-saya-saya  
Ng buhay kong bigla na lamang nag-iba  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Kani-kanina lang  
Pagka-ganda-ganda  
Kani-kanina lang  
Pagka-saya-saya

Don't Let Go
Foreigner
----------------
Another long day, another long night  
I try to make it home before it gets light  
I'm working hard so some day we can play  
When I try to explain you just push me away  
Don't push me away, you say  
I don't spend enough time with you  
Or take an interest in things you do  
We call it quits almost every other day  
And the rare times we're going strong  
We let our pride get in the way  
Seems like it's always in the way  
But don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
But don't let go of our love when it feels right  
This kinda life can put us both to the test  
But it's not a question of who knows best  
Our love's a ship that has it's sails a little torn  
All we need to do is sew 'em up  
And we can weather the storm  
Gonna ride that storm  
So don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
But don't let go  
No, no, don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
Don't let go of our love when it feels right  
I don't see you for days  
When you leave me in the dark  
My imagination runs away  
Just throw me a line  
And I'll still hold on  
I'll still hold on  
I'll still hold on  
And I won't let go  
Don't let go, don't let our love go  
Baby don't let go, just let our love grow  
Oh, no, don't let our love fade away  
And don't let go of our love when it feels right, oh no  
Don't let our love go  
Don't let go  
Just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might slip away  
Don't let our love go  
But don't let go of our love when it feels right

I Had A Dream
Nazareth
----------------
I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I saw the mission band, playing on the green  
It was the saddest thing, I have ever seen  
What did it mean, what did it all mean?  
  
And in my dream, in my same dream  
I saw the soldiers marching, on the green  
The band played a funeral march  
Many a tear was seen  
All in my dream, all in my dream  
  
Lead  
  
I heard the lesson read, I heard the choir  
I saw the falling leaves, landing everywhere  
I saw the family gathered, crying in despair  
I was not there, I was not there

Lunar Bay
Frankie Goes To Hollywood
----------------
Walk right through my soul, keep out the cold  
Make me lose control, fill me with love  
My mind is blasing and were escaping, the real world  
Swing and sway on Lunar bay  
On Lunar bay, yeah  
  
Touch my very soul, makes me lose control  
My dreams unfold, you fill me with love  
  
Feel me walking in the sun  
Hear me talking to the moon  
I won't change for anyone  
I'm just for you  
  
Touch my very soul, makes me lose control  
My dreams unfold, fill me with love  
The train of faces are going places, get on board  
Swing and sway on Lunar bay  
On Lunar bay , yeah  
  
Swing and sway, swing and sway  
  
Feel me walking in the sun  
Hear me talking to the moon  
I won't change for anyone  
I'm just for you  
When the wind rushes in  
To hemald the king  
Just stay in my heart  
Forever more  
  
Feel me walking in the sun  
I won't change for anyone  
When the wind rushes in  
To hemald the king  
Just stay in my heart  
Forever more  
  
In the sun  
I won't change for anyone  
  
In the common age of automation, where people might  
Eventually work ten or twenty hours a week, Man for  
The first time will be forced to confront himself with  
The true spiritual problems of living

She Wolf
David Guetta
----------------
A shot in the dark  
A past lost in space  
And where do I start?  
The past and the chase  
You hunted me down  
Like a wolf, a predator  
I felt like a deer in the lights  
  
You loved me and I froze in time  
Hungry for that flesh of mine  
But I can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees  
What do you see in those yellow eyes?  
'Cause I'm falling to pieces  
  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
Falling to pieces  
  
Did she lie and wait  
Was I bait, to pull you in  
The thrill of the kill  
You feel, is a sin  
I lay with the wolves  
Alone, it seems  
I thought I was part of you  
  
You loved me and I froze in time  
Hungry for that flesh of mine  
But I can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees  
What do you see in those yellow eyes?  
'Cause I'm falling to pieces  
  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
Falling to pieces  
  
I'm falling to pieces  
Falling to pieces

Body Talk
Poison
----------------
Like this I've never seen a woman baby  
That looks quite the way you do  
The way you shake that thing now honey,  
Can't take my eyes off you  
  
The way you work it honey  
It brings me to my knees  
You give me what I'm looking for,  
I'll give you what you need  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the one thing you want,  
Get it all night long  
You got the one thing I need,  
When your body talks  
I hear it talking to me  
Say, get it all night long  
Woman why can't you see  
You're my one thing  
  
I got a world of trouble, baby  
It's going on inside my head  
Playing your game, got me half insane  
Trying to make sense of every word you said  
  
Stop beating around the bush  
You're just wasting time  
Let's get down to the business honey  
And lay it one the line  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me the news,  
Let's hear your story  
You think you got nothing to lose  
You better use it up  
Before it gets old, baby  
And becomes yesterday's news  
  
[Chorus]

I Know Him By Heart
Vonda Shepard
----------------
There's a secret path I follow  
To a place no one can find  
Where I meet my perfect someone  
I've kept hidden in my mind  
  
Where my heart makes my decisions  
Til my dream becomes a vision  
And the love I feel  
Makes him real someday  
  
Cause I know he's out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though I've never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though we've never been together  
We've never been apart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
  
Am I living an illusion?  
Wanting something I can't see  
If I compromise, I'd be living lies  
Pretending love's not meant to be  
  
Cause I know my heart's worth saving  
And I know that he'll be waiting  
So I'll hold on  
I'll stay strong til then  
  
Cause I know he's out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though I've never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though we've never been together  
We've never been apart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart

Auberge
Chris Rea
----------------
On the hard fast train  
On the road to gain  
Something gets right through to your telling bone  
There's a sudden itch  
An electric twitch  
Sometimes I swear this body's got a mind of its own  
This is the naked truth  
This is the light  
There's only one place left to go  
  
Auberge  
  
You meet a silent type  
On a windy trail  
With a shiny cloak and an unseen silver dagger  
You can talk till you ache  
Give yourself one more break  
You can tell by the look on his face  
that it just doesn't matter  
This is the naked truth  
This is the light  
There's only one place left to go  
  
Auberge  
  
Give me a weekend  
Give me a day  
Don't like what I'm seeing though I hear what you say  
Think with a dagger  
And you'll die on your knees  
Begging for mercy  
Singing please mister please  
This is the naked truth  
This is the light  
There's only one place left to go  
  
Auberge

Houston
Dean Martin
----------------
Well it's lonesome in this old town  
Everybody puts me down  
I'm a face without a name  
Just walking in the rain  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
I got holes in both of my shoes  
Well I'm a walking case of the blues  
Saw a dollar yesterday  
But the wind blew it away  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
I haven't eaten in about a week  
I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak  
Nobody calls me friend  
It's sad the shape I'm in  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
I got a girl waiting there for me  
Well at least she said she'd be  
I got a home and a big warm bed  
And a feather pillow for my head  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
Well it's lonesome in this old town  
Everybody put me down  
I'm a face without a name  
Just walking in the rain  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

Love Was New
Chicago
----------------
Remember when we were first falling in love  
How we planned all the things we would do  
Beautiful days and the nights all ablaze  
Hoping our dreams would come true  
Love was new  
Remember the house at the top of the hill  
How the sunlight caressed all the trees  
I played all my music I sang you my love  
The chiming church bells rode the breeze  
Love was new  
Time has a way of obscuring our memories  
And good times are hard to recall  
Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you, every day  
Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  
It seems such a long time ago  
Love was new  
Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  
Our love will always be new  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you,falling in love every day with you

Evil
Steve Miller Band
----------------
You know  
If somebody, somewhere done you wrong  
Oh, don't worry about your revenge, no  
  
I said if somebody, somewhere done you wrong  
Oh, don't worry about your revenge, no no  
'cause that's when evil  
Oh, evil slips on in  
  
Hey, when I first met you baby  
You were nothing but a child  
When I first met you baby  
I used to let you run wild  
  
But somewhere, somehow  
Lord, I don't know how  
All your goodness  
Slipped away  
  
And that's when evil  
Yeah  
Evil let it stay  
Evil let it stay, yeah  
  
Evil's with me in the morning  
Evil's with me and I can't get away, no  
But there's gonna come a time  
Oh, when somebody else is gonna pay  
Gonna pay baby

Deja Vu
Yeah Yeah Yeahs
----------------
Well, black out, well, no time  
The skin of the city is pulling real tight  
Around the big head of the hot rind  
The skin of the city is blushing at the sight  
Of her, of her, of her, of her  
It's deja vu  
You got your big teeth with your big bite  
You're ripping off the wrong tag shaking off the right  
Can you sink ships with your pink thighs?  
The skin of the city is shaking at the sight  
Of her, of her, of her, of her  
It's deja vu  
Well, here it is again  
Can you make it to the end of the deja vu?  
Well, here it comes again  
Can you make it to the end  
Of her, of her, of her, of her, of her?  
The way you look  
Five beats slow  
I'm wiggling  
The way you look  
Five beats slow  
I'm wiggling  
The way you look  
Five beats slow  
I'm wiggling  
Well, here it comes again  
Can you make it to the end of the deja vu?  
Well, here it is again  
Can you make it to the end of the deja vu?  
Well, here it comes again  
Can you make it to the end  
Of her, of her, of her, of her, of her?

Crying In The Rain
Whitesnake
----------------
A black cat moans  
When he's burning with the fever  
A stray dog howls  
When he's lonely in the night  
A woman goes crazy  
With the though of retribution  
But, a man starts weeping  
When he's sick and tired of life  
  
I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow  
Feel I'm wasting my time  
Lighting candles in the wind,  
Always taking my chances  
On the promise of the future  
But, a heart full of sorrow  
Paints a lonely tapestry  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
Crying in the rain  
  
I can never deny  
All the sweet things I have tasted  
Tho' I've been mistreated  
I keep coming back for more,  
I know where I'm going  
There's no hope of absolution  
I can't seem to separate  
The good times from the bad  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain  
  
Crying in the rain

Flower In The Sun
Janis Joplin
----------------
Oh please don't you think baby that I am wrong to cry, yeah.  
You loved me, too,  
So how come you just sit there and laugh  
And laugh and laugh and laugh?  
Things just can't be this way  
And not for very long  
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no.  
Our love affair said it's just history, yes it is.  
  
And I tried to love you in my own way,  
I think that you know I did.  
But to have you here, to see you living,  
Oh so near to me, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Oh but you are distant and so it's dead  
And so often people are glad to be old, yeah yeah,  
Our love affair is just history, yes it is.  
  
Once in a green time a flower  
Oh, fell in love with the sun.  
The passion lasted for an hour  
And then she wilted from her loved one.  
  
Once in a green time a flower  
Oh, fell in love with the sun.  
The passion lasted for an hour  
And then she wilted from her loved one.  
  
And I see you looking up at the sky, how high it is, yeah.  
You wonder if there is, whoa another me  
Now how can that be, how can it be?  
Well, I sit here and I ask you, why all this?  
I just got toni-ni-ni-night  
Our love affair said it's just a history  
But baby, baby, I said it's over, Charlie,  
I can't stand another lo-lo-lonely,  
I'm never too lonely.  
  
It's over baby,  
Where were you when I wanted ya  
And needed ya right by my side?  
I said-a, baby, baby, don't you feel me moving,  
Baby, don't you hear me cry ?  
I know I hurt you, but Lord don't you know I cried,  
I know I hurt you, but babe don't you know I tried,  
Oh baby, oh babe, whoa.

As The Years Go By
Santana
----------------
Well there's nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
Well there's nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I gave you all that I own  
That's one thing you can't deny  
I gave you all that I own  
That's one thing you can't deny  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I'm gonna leave it up to you  
So long,so long good bye  
I'm gonna leave it up to you  
So long,so long good bye  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by

Eternal Idol
Black Sabbath
----------------
No one said it had to be this way  
Why are we the victims of their final word  
  
Dying world is killing us so slowly  
I believe no god may save us now  
  
Can't you see what I see  
Sinners say your prayers tonight  
Your judgment day is here  
Child tomorrow will die, not even  
Born jesus our questions  
He never seems to hear  
Dying for the answers may be  
The price we pay, to find the  
Key to our lives  
Is there a heaven is there a hell  
Who's this god, tell me there's  
No god above, why  
We chose what lord, deep  
Within our souls  
He's not one thing  
We are his spirit  
We could save this world  
From destruction day  
Can't you see what I see  
  
You and I victims of their word  
As the masters of power  
Try to poison our world  
  
Greed money taken over  
Their souls, you're  
Just mechanical brains  
Politicians don't know  
Just don't know  
We can chance this world we  
Live in, don't let it die

The Man With The Child In His Eyes
Kate Bush
----------------
I hear him,  
Before I go to sleep,  
And focus on the day that's been,  
I realize he's there,  
When I turn the light off,  
And turn over,  
Nobody knows about my man,  
They think he's lost on some horizon,  
And suddenly I find myself listening,  
To a man I've never known before,  
Telling me about the sea,  
Oh his love is to eternity.  
  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes,  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes  
  
He's very understanding and he's so,  
Aware of all my situations,  
When I stay up late,  
He's always with me,  
What I feel when I hesitate,  
Oh I'm so worried about my love,  
They say "No, No it won't last forever",  
And here I am again my girl,  
Wondering what on earth I am doing here,  
Maybe he doesn't love me,  
I just took a trip on my love for him.  
  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes,  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes

Tell Me
Divine
----------------
Ooh baby tell me why  
You could look me in the eye  
Swear on us that you're not seeing someone else  
The way you hold me strange  
Know your lips don't feel the same  
You got an attitude I know there's someone new  
Baby don't lie  
You know I get all sensitive and hurt inside  
Darling tell me now  
If you want my loving  
Got to show me what you're all about  
  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm bout through  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm 'bout through  
You cannot hide the feeling you feel inside  
Cause you were the one who let me know that true love is genuine  
Why are you using me can't give up abusing me  
If you don't want me don't pretend we're meant to be  
Baby, don't lie  
You know I get all sensitive and hurt inside  
Darling, tell me now  
If you want my loving  
Got to show me what you're all about  
  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm bout through  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
  
Hand that tell me you're unsure  
Lips that I can't kiss no more  
Eyes that cut me up inside  
Can't take no more can't take no more  
Tell me why I ache inside  
Visions of you in my mind  
Kissing, hugging, hurt so tight  
Can't take no more, can't take no more  
  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm bout through  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do

Love Machine
Wham!
----------------
[Chorus]  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you,  
I'm just a love machine,  
A huggin', kissin' fiend.  
  
I think it's high time you knew,  
Whenever I think of you,  
My mind blows a fuse.  
When I look in you eyes,  
My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.  
My voltage regulator cools,  
When I'm sitting next to you,  
Electricity starts to flow,  
And my indicator starts to glow, wo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gentle as a lamb,  
I'm not that hard to program,  
There's no way that you can lose,  
My chassis fits like a glove,  
I've got a button for love,  
That you have got-to-use.  
If you look into my file,  
I am sure you can find out how,  
To turn me on just set my dial,  
And let me love you for a little while, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you.  
I'm just a love machine  
A huggin' kissin' fiend.

Memories
Christina Aguilera
----------------
When was the last time  
You called me on the phone?  
Said you love me  
And said you needed me  
When was it? Oh baby  
  
It was yesterday  
That I could hide in your arms  
You spoke those those lovely words  
That you want me  
Was that true? I wanna know  
  
Chorus:  
I never knew a love so true so pure so innocent  
But all I have left is sadness and misery  
Those fond memories have left me  
Stripped and I'm in agony  
So why you do this to me?  
  
It seems like I've trusted you  
Broken and torn are my heart when I finally see  
You and her staying around that corner  
Whispers of love have left me so alone  
Did you truly love me?  
  
Just the other day  
I saw another her  
She n you in a bus sharing every pleasant thing in the world  
I was so emotional I wanted to see you so much  
But now it seems that all is gone  
I guess I must move on  
  
Chorus  
  
How can a boy like you act like a man?  
Come back my darlin' and i'll gif you all the happiness  
te amo
You know its true  
Come back please come back...

Nuthin' Changes
Uncle Kracker
----------------
I got more cash than I can put in a bank  
Got pink piranhas swimming in my tank  
Two piece bikinis all around my pool  
My 40-ouncer is never not cool  
Frank Sinatra on the radio  
Some chase the rainbow, I chase the gold  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, I can't complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God  
  
I got a yacht parked down in the keys  
I write my name in the sand when I pee  
My body's tanned except for my wrist  
That's where my shiny diamond Rolex is  
Don Williams on the radio  
Brown bag my diamond, take my lobster to go  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, I can't complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God  
  
It's so easy, so warm and breezy  
I'm so lucky to be me  
  
I got a 24 car garage  
I snap my fingers when I want a massage  
Nuthin' but sevens when I roll the dice  
Sometimes it's lonely, but the view is nice  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, I can't complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, you won't hear me complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God

Six Different Ways
Counting Crows
----------------
(Original by The Cure)  
  
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And every one I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give them more and more  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give the world and more  
They think I'm on my hands and head  
This time they're much too slow  
  
Six sides to every lie I say  
It's that American voice again  
"It was never quite like this before  
Not one of you is the same... "  
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And everyone I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside

A Long December
Counting Crows
----------------
A long December and there's reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'  
Now the days go by so fast  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would  
  
The smell of hospitals in winter  
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls  
All at once you look across a crowded room  
To see the way that light attaches to a girl  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think you might come to California I think you should  
  
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.  
And talked a little while about the year  
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,  
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her  
  
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself  
To hold on to these moments as they pass  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyon  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean I guess I should  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Respect
Gary Numan
----------------
That's OK  
If that's the way you wanna play it  
I don't mind  
I can play it anyway  
You won't stop  
Until I pul you to pieces  
Which I will in time  
But I'm still curious  
You're so young  
Not one backbone between you  
But you think you'll make a hero  
Quite peculiar  
You're just boys  
You don't know what you've angered  
Did you know you're talking to the heart  
Of the machine?  
Welcome boys  
Welcome to the real world  
I could almost be sorry  
But I could be wrong  
I know you  
I know what you've been doing  
I know where you live  
And I know where you are  
You know me  
I'm the smiling assassin  
You know I won't forgive  
And you know I won't forget

All For You
Our Lady Peace
----------------
A suburban man  
At my door  
But I don't think I'll let him in  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
Control over the way I live  
  
He wants the best for me  
Old school philosophy  
So I can't turn my back on him  
He'd buy me anything  
But I just need a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all for you  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
You're the blood, I'm the seed  
And it's all that I need  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
You've got me, oh, you've got me  
  
Jack Kerouac  
Kerouac  
On the road and in my head  
I need relevance  
Intelligence  
A new tattoo and lots more sex  
  
Broken families  
Are the new enemies  
And you will not make up for this  
This suburban man  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
But I just need a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where you want  
  
Alone  
Leave me alone  
  
It's all for you  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's all for you  
(Just stop breaking my heart) [Repeat x6]  
  
Leave me alone

Gave It A Name
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
In the fields of the lord  
Stood Abel and Cain  
Cain slew Abel 'neath the black rain  
At night he couldn't stand the guilt or the blame  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
  
Billy got drunk, angry at his wife  
He hit her once, he hit her twice  
At night he'd lie in bed, he couldn't stand the shame  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
  
Pa told me "Son, one thing I know is true  
Poison snake bites you, you're poison too"  
At night I can feel that poison runnin' 'round my veins

All That Hammering
Mary Black
----------------
I used to think joy, was the break between sorrow,  
Like peace was the break between wars,  
I'm still partly new now, but mostly older,  
And I can not say I'm so sure.  
Chorus  
I never trusted happiness, as far as I could throw it,  
Always preparing for the worst, 'cause I would know it,  
All of that hammering in the dark, like a new noah working on his ark,  
On his ark.  
I may look back at today and feel foolish,  
My old view was right all along,  
I will rush in, where no angels are walking,  
And fight for the right to be wrong.  
Chorus  
'cause I never trusted happiness, as far as I could throw it,  
Always preparing for the worst, 'cause I would know it,  
Of that hammering in the dark, like a new noah working on his ark,  
On his ark.  
Between my potential and the deep blue sea,  
There's a rock and a diamond either side of me,  
Between our potential and the break of day,  
There is nothing at all in our way,  
Nothing in our way.

Old England
Waterboys
----------------
Man looks up on a yellow sky  
And the rain turns to rust in his eye  
Rumors of his health are lies  
Old England is dying  
His clothes are a dirty shade of blue  
And his ancient shoes worn through  
He steals from me and he lies to you  
Old England is dying  
Still he sings an empire song  
Still he keeps his navy strong  
And he sticks his flag where it ill belongs  
Old England is dying  
You're asking what makes me sigh now  
What it is makes me shudder so well  
I just freeze in the wind and I'm  
Numb from the pummelin' of the snow  
That falls from high in yellow skies  
Down on where the well loved flag of England flies  
Where homes are warm and mothers sigh  
Where comedians laugh and babies cry  
Where criminals are televised politicians fraternize  
Journalists are dignified and everyone is civilized  
And children stare with Heroin eyes  
Old England!  
Evening has fallen  
The swans are singing  
The last of Sunday's bells is ringing  
The wind in the trees is sighing  
And old England is dying

Sunday In Savannah
Nina Simone
----------------
One more  
Sunday in Savannah  
Hear the whole creation shoutin'  
Praise the Lord  
  
See them flinging out the banner  
While the congregation says amen  
Young folk  
Tendin' Sunday School  
  
They sing merrilly 'bout the golden rule  
Horse sense preaching all the day  
They all hollar in the righteous way  
It's time for me to call on Mother Hannah  
  
While she sits there wishing for her last reward  
One more Sunday in Savannah  
One more Sunday in Atlanta  
It's the same thing  
  
Same feeling  
Don't ya dare  
Go fishin' son  
Amen

Lessons For The Lover
Usher
----------------
Turn the lights on  
  
How could someone hurt you but still make you feel so good?  
Holler, scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it  
Just cause he gives you pain, that don't mean he ain't the one  
Fuck you out your brain you'll be smiling when he's done  
  
So my advice would be no don't leave, don't go so easy, no  
Let that argument turn you on  
It's worth it  
  
And these are the lessons learned by lovers  
These are the reasons we make love  
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye  
You learn all these lessons when you're in love  
A lesson for the lover, the lover  
A lesson for the lover, the lover  
  
So hard to imagine living life without them there  
'Cause now you're so caught up in the passion  
But this shit is beyond compare, yeah  
Cause don't he make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drum  
You fought hard but think about how hard you come  
  
So my advice would be no don't leave, don't go so easy, no  
Just let that argument turn you on  
It's worth it  
  
And these are the lessons learned by lovers  
These are the reasons we make love  
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye  
You learn all these lessons when you're in love  
A lesson for the lover, the lover  
A lesson for, a lesson for the lover, the lover  
  
C'mon here  
  
No one wants to be fighting  
All day long, all night long  
So we'll just scream 'til we start making love (do you)  
And as time goes on we're feeling  
OK, babe, alright, love  
And we'll forget about it in the morning  
  
And these are the lessons learned by lovers  
These are the reasons we make love  
There's no exception, one day we gotta look each other in the eye  
You learn all these lessons when you're in love  
A lesson for the lover, the lover  
A lesson for the lover, the lover

Is It In My Head
Who
----------------
I see a man without a problem  
I see a country always starved,  
I hear the music of a heartbeat,  
I walk, and people turn and laugh.  
  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is in my head here at the start?  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head, or in my heart?  
  
I pick up phones and hear my history.  
I dream of all the calls I miss.  
I try to number those who love me,  
And find exactly what the trouble is.  
  
Is it in my head etc.  
I feel I'm being followed,  
My head is empty  
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence.  
Make love to a stranger  
Just asking for directions  
Turn from being help to being questions.  
  
I see a man without a problem.

Mumbo Jumbo
Squeeze
----------------
Eyebrows plucked and toenails cut,  
I'll pick you up with a little luck, all prim and proper.  
Shaven legs and calls to Fred,  
It all depends o' alright then, I can not stop her.  
The makeup box has always got,  
Ever such a lot of odds and sods, in there to offer.  
She needs paints to make her face,  
And make her late again and again  
So I'll knock her  
The tick is tocker.  
Mumbo jumbo words to say,  
Are you coming out,  
Coming out,  
Coming out to play?  
With a broken nose on a sunny day,  
I would bet,  
I would bet,  
None of these girls would ever care,  
Or get upset.  
Or get upset.  
  
Short and fat with a fishnet hat,  
And a hungry cat in a nice new flat, with her Scrabble.  
Sits by the phone when she's all alone,  
And on her own it's a mental home, full of babble.  
Writes with charm to uncle farm,  
With a broken arm in a broken barn, feeds the cattle.  
She hears the hens as she takes the pen,  
And it's now and now it's then [and now and then a little arab friend],  
She would saddle.  
The dip is dabbled  
  
Kissing curls and boyish girls,  
For all the pearls in all the world, wouldn't have me.  
If I had oil and money to spoil,  
I'd mix with loyal and I get some royal, little lassie.  
I'm up at nine down the line,  
To watch the time 'till half past five.  
I wish they'd sack me  
She's at home the milkman's home  
To have a farm and seeds to sow  
It makes her happy  
The chip is chappie.

Neverland
J Cole
----------------
[Chorus:]  
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?  
If you want it, come and see me  
I aint got nothing but time  
One day you're gonna set me free  
But first you gotta let me shine  
Niggas aint high as I be  
See, look momma I'm flyin'  
  
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland  
I'll probably never land  
Neverland, Neverland, noo, I'll never never land  
  
[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Check my fortune cookie, it's that Cole World  
Could that mean it's meant to be?  
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur  
This life is f-cking with me mentally  
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me  
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies  
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me  
My bad girl sayin' f-ck all that, enter me  
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies  
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee  
Anything to take my mind off  
I logged on and made them muthaf-ckas sign off  
I got the on my dick they'll never climb off  
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)  
I don't know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans  
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
I'm sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together  
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever  
I gotta make it to the top, it's either now or never  
These other niggas can't adapt because they not as clever  
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better  
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter  
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather  
And, so sick they can't fix this with medi-cine  
We at yo door and she gotta let us in  
It's what you want, I whet your appetite  
Cole hit the scene now I'm what everyone rapping like  
Shame you feel you have to bite  
Still aint nobody snapping right  
Pedal to the metal as I'm speeding through the traffic lights  
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already  
Still fight like I'm the underdog, I'm on already  
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, ya'll already already  
  
[Chorus:]

Nazareth
----------------
You can have girls and girls  
You can have boys and boys  
You can have sex and violence  
You can have space age toys  
You can have anything that you think will fit  
As long as it's box office, as long as it's a hit  
  
Cinema, cinema  
  
You can have birdmen and snowmen  
You can have women in red  
Hero taxi drivers talk about evil dead  
Black hats and white hats you know what I mean  
A flashdance welder and Jesus in jeans  
  
Cinema, cinema  
  
Norma Jean has gone with the wind  
And we'll never, never see her no more  
Jimmy Dean you drove that machine  
Chased a dream, chased a dream  
  
We've been up the junction, down the yellow brick road  
We've got beauty with beast  
And a prince with a toad  
We've got future adventures  
You believe man can fly  
Put on your 3-d glasses  
Get a shark in the eye

THE BLUES COME AROUND
Hank Williams
----------------
Once I was happy as I could be  
But I let a girl make a fool of me  
And ever since she let me down  
The blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
As long as the sun is in the sky  
These doggone blues never make me cry  
But ever since she left this town  
The blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
I built my castles very high  
And then she went and said goodbye  
And ever since she tore 'em down  
The blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
Once she called me all her own  
But now she's gone and I'm alone  
And ever evenin' I'm sorrow bound  
'Cause the blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Yeah, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Joni Mitchell
----------------
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Rollin' past the rink  
Past the record shack  
Pink fins in the falling rain  
Rollin'  
To the blue lights past the water mains  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Weekends we'd get  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
  
Ray's dad teaches math  
Zero  
I'm a dunce  
I'm a decimal in his class  
Last night's kisses won't erase  
Zero  
I just can't keep the numbers in their place  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Last night we had  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
  
When it comes to mathematics  
I got static in the attic  
"No sir, nothin's clear!"  
I'll be blackboard blind on Monday  
Dreamin' of blue runways  
On the edge of here  
A little atmosphere  
  
Blue lights out on airport road  
Motown, in a field in a farmer's grove  
Big planes comin' overhead  
Lowdown  
You can see the bolts  
You can see the tire treads  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Weekends we'd get  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Oh, little darlin'  
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard  
Romance in the back of  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac  
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

The Ship Song
Nick Cave
----------------
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Come loose your dogs upon me  
And let your hair hang down  
You are a little mystery to me  
Every time you come around  
  
We talk about it all night long  
We define our moral ground  
But when I crawl into your arms  
Everything comes tumbling down  
  
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Your face has fallen sad now  
For you know the time is nigh  
When I must remove your wings  
And you, you must try to fly  
  
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Come loose your dogs upon me  
And let your hair hang down  
You are a little mystery to me  
Every time you come around

Underground
Arlo Guthrie
----------------
Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
There's a river running underground  
That roll along the clay  
That took my body when I laid it down  
And carried it far away  
It's too damned dark for you to see  
So I did not protest  
My soul shook free, you can't have me  
But you may keep the rest  
The waters weep, the sickles reap  
My hands are cold with sweat  
The eagle screams with frightened wings  
The dust does not forget  
There's a river running underground  
That rolls along the clay  
That tempts the sould to the ocean cold  
To with the body lay

Barbra Streisand

I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
[Speaking]  
You play real good!  
How old are you? Eight?  
...I was eight once...  
For a whole year!  
Then I went on to the big time...  
Nine...Ten...  
[Singing]  
I got daisies in green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
All man trouble, I don't mind him  
You won't find him  
Round and round and round my door  
I got starlight  
I got sweet dream  
I got my man  
Who can ask for anything more  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man

Heartaches

Heartaches, heartaches  
My loving you meant only heartaches  
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me  
I can't believe it's just a burning memory  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches for you  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
My loving you meant only heartaches  
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me  
I can't believe it's just a burning memory  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches for you

What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches  
And my heart breaks  
And my heart aches for you

Much has been written about  
The world and all its kind of loves  
But the sweetest of them all  
You seldom will find stories of, oh, oh, oh, oh  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning  
Says, she'll never leave me and I know it's so  
La la la

You don't have to look around  
Or ask yourself if she is there  
'Cause the fragrance of her love  
Says, 'Hi' with every breath of air, oh, oh, oh, oh  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning

Describing anothers prettiness  
But if ever there was choice  
My flower would be the prettiest, oh, oh, oh, oh  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning  
Says, she'll never leave me and I know it's so  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning

Scents And Subtle Sounds
Phish
----------------
If you would only stop to live  
One moment at a time  
You would I think, be startled by  
The things that you would find  
Like scents you never noticed  
And many subtle sounds  
Like colors in the landscape  
And textures of the town  
And the winds would lift you up  
Into the sky above  
And you'd be treated to a view  
Of everything you love  
And if the moment passes  
You should try it once again  
For if you do it right you'll find  
The moment never ends

David Allan Coe
----------------
How do you spell relief?  
I get D-are-you-N-K  
Lately Dave since my baby left me  
I do it almost every day  
It's the only thing that I've found  
That'll take the hurt away  
  
Well how do you spell relief John?  
  
I get D-are-you-N-K  
Every night about sundown I get a pain down deep inside  
This old broken heart acts up  
There's a hurtin' in my pride  
Well I've found a sure fire treatment  
That'll get me feelin' right  
When your memory starts flarin' up  
I just head for the neon lights  
  
How do you spell relief David?  
  
I get D-are-you-N-K  
Lately since my baby left  
I do it almost every day  
It's the only thing that I've found John  
That'll take the hurt away  
  
Well how do you spell relief?  
  
I just get D-are-you-N-K  
  
John Hartford  
  
I don't need no doctor  
Tell me what is wrong  
I can fill my own perscriptions  
And it lasts me all night long  
It's the perfect medication  
For an ailment such as mine  
I forget about the tears I've cried  
When the whiskey hits my mind  
  
How do we spell relief?  
We get D-are-you-N-K  
Lately since my baby left me  
I do it almost every day  
Well I tell ya Johnny  
Its the only thing I've found  
That'll take the pain away  
  
How do we spell relief?  
We get D-are-you-N-K  
  
How do we spell relief?  
We get D-are-you-N-K  
  
How do we spell relief?  
We get D-are-you-N-K  
  
We're havin' fun now ain't we?

Together In Electric Dreams
Human League
----------------
I only knew you for a while  
I never saw your smile  
Till it was time to go  
Time to go away (time to go away)  
Sometimes it's hard to recognise  
Love comes as a surprise  
And it's too late  
It's just too late to stay  
Too late to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
We'll always be together  
However far it seems  
(Love never ends)  
We'll always be together  
Together in electric dreams  
  
Because the friendship that you gave  
Has taught me to be brave  
No matter where I go, I'll never find a better prize  
(Find a better prize)  
Though you're miles and miles away  
I see you every day  
I don't have to try  
I just close my eyes  
I close my eyes  
  
[Chorus]

On A Slow Boat To China
Bing Crosby
----------------
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore  
Leave all your lovers weeping on the faraway shore  
  
Out on the briny with the moon big and shinny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Out on the briny with the moon big and shinny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
On a slow boat to China, all to myself alone

Calling All Stations
Genesis
----------------
Calling all stations  
Can anybody tell me, tell me exactly where I am  
I've lost all sense of direction  
Watching the darkness closing around me  
Feeling the cold all through my body  
That's why I'm calling all stations  
In the hope that someone hears me  
A single lonely voice  
  
I feel the sensation disappearing  
There's a tingling in my arms  
And there's a numbness in my hands  
  
All the broken promises  
All my good intentions don't add up to very much  
And I realize whatever happened, whatever happened  
I remember all the moments that I've wasted in my life  
All the things I was always gonna do  
Why is it now when it's too late  
That I've finally realized it's important to me  
To think that everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And it's tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
  
Calling all stations  
Can anybody tell me, tell me exactly where I am  
How different things look when your all on your own  
Watching the darkness closing all around me  
All around me  
And I'm lost with feeling  
Of your arms to remind me  
Of everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And it's tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
Don't you know there's never been a moment  
When I haven't had the thought  
That everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And it's tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
As I sit here in the darkness  
Feeling so alone  
And everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart

Fair Weather Ahead
INXS
----------------
There's this place full of mountain heads  
Living and chewing on the fat  
Built upon the hazy plan  
Like foundations slipping through the sand  
  
Long teeth and whiskers like a rat  
Fearing only those present  
They got zero emotion  
And everybody's fed up with that  
  
Warm outside but very cold within  
Followed and praised for many years  
They got all the promotions  
Isn't that the way it's always been  
  
History's written always red  
It's pages are painful and clear  
It's so full of devotion  
Makes you wonder where it could have led  
  
Put the lights out, fair weather ahead  
These strange new creatures  
Aha, they won't be led

That Which I Have Lost
George Harrison
----------------
He's fighting the forces of darkness limitation  
Falsehood and mortality which bar him  
The way back into the higher world  
While his whole being is bewildered  
He does not know no law of action  
Taking refuge inside himself and he's saying  
  
I need someone to show me  
Illumine my consciousness  
Remove the dark from in me  
And give me that which I have lost  
  
As all had seemed lost a light from Heaven  
Breaking  
A flash inward illumination  
Enriched his life more than any words can tell  
He stood there, life renewed fresh as rain  
Scales were falling from his eyes again  
The bolts of his prison opening he's saying  
  
I found someone who showed me  
Illumined my consciousness  
Removed the dark from in me  
And given me that which I have lost  
  
You people don't have time to listen to him  
You're too busy fighting revolutions  
That keep you back down in the lower world  
Your mirrors of understanding they need  
Cleansing  
Polish away the dust of desire  
Before pure light will reflect in them  
  
You need someone to show you  
Illumine your consciousness  
Remove the dark from in you  
And give you that which you have lost.

Bob
NOFX
----------------
He spent 15 years  
Getting loaded for 15 years  
Till his liver exploded  
Now what's Bob gonna do  
Now that he can't drink?  
The Doctor said: "What ya been thinking bout?"  
Bob said, "that's the point. I won't think bout nothing.  
Now I gotta do something else  
  
To pass the time  
Had someone shave his head  
He got a new identity  
62 hole air cushioned boots  
And a girl who rides a scooter  
To take him out of town  
They would get away  
Running around  
And as the trucks drive by  
You can hear the mother fuckers go "PUNK!"  
  
A couple of lines, an extra thermos of Joe  
He'll be kicking in heads at the punk rock show  
Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what  
Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what to do  
When the doctor tells him to  
Quit your drinking, now's the time  
But will he ever walk the line?  
To all my friends I feel just great  
But will he ever walk the line?  
  
Kicking ass, and busting heads  
Red suspenders  
Once a day he shaves his head  
But will he ever walk the line? [Repeat: x2]  
  
Bob!

Jelly Roll
Nina Simone
----------------
Oh yeah, yeah  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine, yeah  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.  
Sunday after meetings and Saturday with a man  
Sweet potato pie when you eat from the pan  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine.  
Can you dig it?  
Dancing the latest dance and eating ribs and tips  
Digging all the new sounds and drinking gin in sips  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine, baby  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul.  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Let's go, let's go, let's go.  
To tie up my do right (?) and tighten up my 'fro  
Wrapping myself in black and still I shine and glow  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.

Down
Pearl Jam
----------------
Down. Fall by the wayside no getting out.  
Down. Cry me a river dried up and dammed.  
The names can be changed but the place is still the same.  
I am loaded. Told that all's for naught. Holds me down.  
  
Rise. Life is in motion. I'm stuck in line.  
Rise. You can't be neutral on a moving train.  
One day the symptoms fade. Think I'll throw these pills away.  
And if hope could grow from dirt like me. It can be done.  
  
Won't let the light escape from me.  
Won't let the darkness swallow me.  
  
So long.

Better
Guns N' Roses
----------------
No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
The hardest part this troubled heart has never  
Yet been through now.  
We've healed the scars that got their start  
Inside someone like you now.  
  
Well had I known or I'd been shown back  
When I longed you'd take me.  
To break the charge that brought me home  
And all that won't erase me.  
  
I never would know that I could  
No matter what you'd pay me.  
Replay the part, you stole my heart  
I should have known you're crazy.  
  
If all I knew was that with you  
I'd want someone to save me.  
It'd be enough, but just my luck,  
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was  
  
Now I know you better,  
You know I'd know better,  
Now I know you better!  
  
So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,  
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,  
A twist of fate, a change of heart,  
Kills my infatuation,  
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.

Fan The Flame
The Temptations
----------------
Once a wiseman said to me  
This advice I give you free,  
A woman is made of fantasy  
So fan the flame.  
  
Always keep her hopes up high.  
Make her laugh don't make her cry and don't let her love die,  
So fan the flame.  
A woman needs love and affection and little things mean a lot  
(Little things mean a lot)  
  
And when she has an emotional baby.  
That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot.  
Make her feel shes ten feet tall, even though she short and small.  
So fan the flame.  
  
Her love is your reality let her go and you will see just how lonely life can
be.  
So fan the flame.  
A woman needs love and praising so give her them each day  
Tell her you love her, its added protection  
That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot.  
  
Once a wiseman said to me  
This advice I give you free,  
A woman is made of fantasy  
So fan the flame.

Forever And One (Neverland)
Helloween
----------------
What can I do?  
Will I be getting through?  
Now that I must try  
To leave it all behind  
  
Did you see  
What you have done to me  
So hard to justify  
Slowly is passing by  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide  
Your lies, your lies  
  
Here I am  
Seeing you once again  
My mind's so far away  
My heart's so close  
quedarse
Too proud to fight  
I'm walking back into night  
Will I ever find  
Someone to believe?  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide your lies  
Your lies

Come To Me
Kari Jobe
----------------
Come to me you weary one  
And I will give you rest, I will give you rest  
Come to me you weary one  
And I will give you rest, I will give you rest  
For my own is easy and my burden is light  
Take me upon you, I will give you rest  
  
Come to me you broken one  
And I will give you peace, I will give you peace  
Come to me you broken one  
And I will give you peace, I will give you peace  
You will calm your waters, and I will whisper peace be still  
Take me upon you, I will give you peace  
  
Come to me, Come to me  
Come to me  
I have been waiting for you here  
I have been waiting for you here  
  
Come to me you burdened one  
And I will give you joy, I will give you joy  
Come to me you burdened one  
And I will give you joy, I will give you joy  
You will rise like eagles, and my joy will be your strength  
Take me upon you, I will give you joy  
  
Come to me, Come to me  
Come to me  
I have been waiting for you here  
He has been waiting for you here  
  
Come, Come to Him  
Come find your peace  
Come find your rest  
Come find your joy  
He is waiting here for you, he is waiting here for you  
With open arms, to hold you, to embrace your heart  
To love you  
He is waiting here, He is waiting here

Today Is The Day
Yo La Tengo
----------------
I followed you foolishly  
You were at a smoky bar, you were out til three  
Sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four  
We were gonna wait for you all night  
So I locked the door  
  
I was gonna spend the night, coulda been okay  
We were gonna talk all night, till I went away  
Remember how you used to say, can't stay up late  
A minute later we're older now, I can't stay awake  
I'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet  
I remember that rusty car, like it was yesterday  
  
Saw my brother driving by, the other day  
I wished that I'd go out to him, but he drove away  
Saw my sister standing there, standing in rain  
Then I thought about nothing, that it feels the same  
  
Another day, come and gone  
Don't think I can ever sing that song  
Little secrets we bring along  
I'm taking my time, trailing behind, I thought of you  
Today is the day I think of you

Back From Baltimore
Neil Diamond
----------------
Hey, see how she kissed me  
Yeah, no reason for the girl to lie  
She say she gonna miss me  
Yeah, smile on my face, I wave goodbye  
  
But I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby, where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
Yeah, I'm about to crumble  
Yeah, come see me die before your eyes  
Yeah, my thoughts all jumbled  
And my throat is dry from asking why  
  
But I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby, where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Girl, I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby where are you?  
Well, I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby, where are you?  
Where are you?

Dark Fantasy
Kanye West
----------------
You might think you've peeped the scene  
You haven't  
The real one is far to mean  
The wattered down, the one you know  
Was made up centuries ago  
They it sound all wack and corny  
Yes its awful blasted boring  
Twisted fiction, sick addiction  
Well gather round children  
Zip it listen!  
  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I fantasized about this back in Chicago  
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago  
That's me, the first year that I blow  
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo  
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo  
Me found bravery in my bravado  
D.J's need to listen to the model's  
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?  
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)  
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?  
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow  
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo  
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow  
  
Can we get much higher?  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion  
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis  
Beyond the truest  
Hey, teacher, teacher  
Tell me how do you respawn the students?  
And refresh the page and restart the memory?  
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?  
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies  
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me  
The plan was to drink until the pain over  
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?  
Fresh air, rolling down the window  
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low  
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh  
Don't make me pull the toys  
And fire up the engines huh  
And then they make noise  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
At the mall there was a seance  
Just kids, no parents  
Then the sky filled with heroines  
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron  
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us  
(And the fires did declare us)  
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)  
(And moved her back in Paris)  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All Rounds On Me
R. Kelly
----------------
Hey, me and my baby got into a fight  
Man, it must've lasted all through the night  
By the time the rooster crowed at the crack of the light  
We made love, now everything's alright, yeah  
  
All the rounds on me 'cause I feel real good tonight  
Said, all the rounds on me 'cause I feel real good tonight

Everything gonna be alright  
  
Hey, bartender fix up a drink for everybody in here tonight  
Smile on my face and I'm ready to rock  
Ain't got no bad news tonight  
Well the band is cookin', the girls good-looking  
Got my eye on only one tonight  
Me and my baby reunited

We gon' make some love tonight  
Where the joy is swinggin' and everybody's singing  
Rock 'n roll songs tonight

We're going to a motel room and make some love  
Shots on me 'cause feel real good tonight

All rounds on me, all rounds on me  
All rounds on me, all rounds on me

Closer
Kylie Minogue
----------------
We'll redesign  
Where we combine  
To be divine  
Love in us  
  
Give me the sign  
View these confines  
We start to shine  
Love in us  
  
Closer and closer  
And closer  
To you now  
Never enough  
  
Closer and closer  
You pull me  
Give me more  
Soft and slow  
  
We are breathing the same  
We are moving the same  
And we were  
And we are  
  
We're free-designed  
Become aligned  
We are combined  
Love in us  
  
Closer and closer  
And closer  
To you now  
Never enough  
  
Closer and closer  
You pull me  
Give me more  
Soft and slow

Never Told
J Cole
----------------
Yeah, hey, wassup girl  
Hey, yeah, uh  
  
Uh, angel eyes, long hair  
I see you cryin', what's wrong there  
He did what? He fucked who?  
We know the story, what's new?  
See I could probably, rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage, fuck you  
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do  
But the truth is, we all the same  
On different teams, but it's all a game  
The objective, tryna score  
You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow  
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated, and somehow I never told  
I never told  
  
"Hey, you wanna be a man?  
Yeah I wanna be a man.  
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.  
I ain't gonna tell.  
Alright then man. You're a man now.  
Okay."  
  
OK, that's what it is, I see the game  
The hoes come, the seasons change  
The hoes go, we rearrange  
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same  
The old G's that beat the game  
Forever young, Peter Pan  
Thirty five, still playin', child support, still payin'  
Jugglin', bill payin'  
Been runnin' round, field dayin'  
Wine and dine, meal payin'  
With hopes that she'll land  
The bed and, get wet then, give head then  
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man  
One night stands, no best man  
No bridesmaids, or reverends  
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noah's Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
"You know what? I need to talk to you.  
About what?  
I don't think this is, working out for us.  
Why?  
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.  
What the fuck?!"

Like A Drug
Kylie Minogue
----------------
Boy, ya, you got it, got it  
You got me feelin' crazy 'bout my body  
I, I cannot cannot stop it  
You got Me movin', got me rockin' rockin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Make me feel like I can make it real  
You got me hooked, gettin' me on the floor  
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dance like I'm the only, only  
Like I'm the only lady, like you want me  
Damn right, I have my radar on you  
So let's get physical, I want to, want to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine  
You really blow my mind  
When we rock, when we rock

The things you make me do, like a drug, like a drug  
  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine  
You really blow my mind  
I really wanna do, everything with you  
The things you make me do  
  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug

Wasted Words
Allman Brothers Band
----------------
Can you tell me, tell me, friend, just exactly where I've been?  
Is that so much to ask? I'll pay you back no matter what the task.  
You seem really sure 'bout something I don't know,  
take that load off, looks like chest's about to go.  
Your wasted words already been heard, are you really God, yes or no?  
  
Well, all day and half the night you're walkin' round lookin' such a fright.  
Is it me or is it you? I'd make a wager and I'd hope you lose.  
Time's gone, looks like Rome is 'bout to fall,  
Next time take the elevator, please don't crawl.  
Your wasted words so absurd, are you really Satan, yes or no?  
  
Well, I ain't no saint and you sure as hell ain't no savior,  
Every other Christmas I would practice good behavior.  
That was then, this is now, don't ask me to be Mister Clean,  
'cause baby, I don't know how.  
Ring my phone 'bout ten more times, we will see,  
find that broke down line and let it be.  
Your wasted words will never be heard, go on home baby and watch it on TV.  
  
Weekday soap-box specialty, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout now,  
By the way, this song's for you, sincerely, me.

Butterfly
Verve
----------------
You could flap you wings a thousand miles away  
Butterfly  
A laughing salesman sings  
His world so far away  
Butterfly  
  
Butterfly (repeat)  
  
You could take the storm away forever every day  
'Cause you're mine  
And I don't know what to say  
You could let my smile disappear for a year  
'Cause you're mine  
That's the only way I like it to be  
  
Butterfly (repeat)  
  
Now we get to the best part  
It happens all the time, telling me all your lies  
You get your kicks from seeing me on the floor  
Tied to your bed  
Tied to the things you said  
Butterfly coming back  
Butterfly coming back  
  
Butterfly

Change The Man
Howard Jones
----------------
Don't talk to me about ban the bomb  
Don't talk to me about who's side I'm on  
Replace the system with one just the same  
Don't you know that we are all to blame  
It's so easy as an armchair blamer  
Get off your seat and make a personal change sir  
Can't change the system by smashing it down  
Inside route personal revolution  
Chorus  
Change the man  
Rip out the root  
Let's get rid of this insanity  
When the mothers had told the kids straight  
When the fathers felt no more hate  
When a man can walk down the street without fear  
Then thing must change and it's not too late  


this is the end of the song

Distant Sun
Crowded House
----------------
Tell me all the things you would change  
I don't pretend to know what you want  
When you come around and spin my top  
Time and again, time and again  
  
No fire where I lit my spark  
I am not afraid of the dark  
Where your words devour my heart  
And put me to shame, put me to shame  
  
When your seven worlds collide  
Whenever I'm by your side  
And dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
Still so young to travel so far  
Old enough to know who you are  
Wise enough to carry the scars  
Without any blame, there's no one to blame  
  
It's easy to forget what you learned  
Waiting for the thrill to return  
Feeling your desire burn  
And drawn to the flame  
  
When your seven worlds collide  
Whenever I'm by your side  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
And I'm lying on the table  
Washed out in a flood  
Like a Christian feeling vengeance from above  
I don't pretend to know what you want  
But I offer love  
  
Seven worlds will collide  
Whenever I'm by your side  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
As time slips by  
  
As time slips by

Makin' Whoopee
Rod Stewart
----------------
Another bride, another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season, another reason  
For makin' whoopee  
  
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice  
The groom is nervous, he answers twice  
Its really killin'  
That he's so willin' to make whoopee  
  
Now picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring, yes  
  
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes  
He's so ambitious he even sews  
But don't forget folks,  
That's what you get folks, for makin' whoopee  
  
Another year, maybe less  
What's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?  
She feels neglected, and he's suspected  
Of makin' whoopee  
  
Yeah, she sits alone,  
Most every night  
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write  
He says he's busy,  
But she says, "Is he?"  
He's makin' whoopee  
  
Now he doesn't make much money  
Only five thousand per  
Some judge who thinks he's funny  
Says, "You'll pay six to her."  
  
He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"  
Judge say, "Budge. Right into jail.  
You'd better keep her. I think it's cheaper  
Than makin' whoopee."  
  
Yes, yeah, you better keep her  
Daddy, I think it's cheaper  
Then makin' whoopee

Fearless
Pink Floyd
----------------
You say the hill's too steep to climb  
Chiding!  
You say you'd like to see me try  
Climbing!  
You pick the place and I'll choose the time  
And I'll climb  
The hill in my own way  
just wait a while, for the right day  
And as I rise above the treeline and the clouds  
I look down hear the sound of the things you said today  
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling  
Merciless, the magistrate turns 'round, frowning  
and who's the fool who wears the crown  
Go down in your own way  
And everyday is the right day  
And as you rise above the fearlines in his frown  
You look down  
Hear the sound of the faces in the crowd

Lose Again
Linda Ronstadt
----------------
Written by Karla Bonoff  
(C) 1975 Seagrape Music (BMI)  
Save me  
Free me  
From my heart this time  
Well the train's gone  
Down the track and I'm  
I'm left behind  
But nothing can save me from this ball and chain  
I've made up my mind I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane  
'Cause I'll love you and lose again  
Well the heart calls  
And the mind obeys  
Oh it knows better than me baby  
And if I hold on for one more day  
Oh maybe maybe he'll be true  
But nothing can save me from this ball and chain  
I've made up my mind I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane  
'Cause I'll love you and lose again  
Nothing can save me from this ball and chain  
I've made up my mind I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane  
'Cause I'll love you and lose again  
Woah I'll love you and lose again

King For A Day
Gino Vannelli
----------------
Blinded by the magenta spotlight  
Stands a disposable commodity  
Don't a high price ticket make a star shine so bright  
A taste of immortality  
And the critics they call you the new 'boy wonder'  
And you know just how to make a young girl cry  
The more you feed them the more they hunger  
As you watch the money multiply  
  
[Chorus:]  
How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be?  
King... for a day  
  
You got the whole damn world spinning 'round your middle finger  
Hey! Shoot a little skeet with the president  
And your mother loves you more for every dollar you bring her  
And yor latest wife is worth every cent  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blinded by the magenta spotlight  
Stands a manufactured fantasy  
Don't a high price ticket make a star  
Shine so bright  
And the people love you endlessly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be... King.

Coconut Cream
Tragically Hip
----------------
There's a cannon shooting  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons in a steady stream  
There's a cannon shooting  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons at a steady stream  
  
It's wing music to a happy cat  
He likes his butterflies  
Slow and fat  
And wing music to a happy cat  
He likes his butterflies  
Slow and fat  
  
Us little Christians in a circle  
Jerk  
Til our daddy gets home from  
Work  
All us good Christians in a circle  
Jerk  
Til our daddy gets home from  
Work  
  
There's a cannon shooting  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons in a steady stream  
There's a cannon that shoots  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons in a steady stream

Sordid Lives
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
Now who's to judge who's a saint and who's a sinner  
Lord, it's tough enough to trudge from brunch to dinner  
We seek the light of truth between our white lies  
We sleep away our youth under tattletale skies  
  
Now who's to say who's a sinner and who's a saint  
Who's to say who you can love and who you can't  
Now it's easy for the pot to call the kettle black  
They're just jealous of the hot and lusty sordid lives they led  
  
Ain't it a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
It's a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
It's a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
  
Now we struggled comin' down the chute to take our first breath  
And we struggle for acceptance from birth to death  
But the Lord's too busy tryin' to keep the world on it's feet  
He ain't got time to give a damn about what goes on between the sheets  
  
Ain't it a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
It's a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
It's a bitch sortin' out our sorry little sordid lives

If You Were The Only Girl In The World
Perry Como
----------------
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy  
  
Nothing else would matter in the world today  
We could go on loving in the same old way  
A garden of Eden, just made for two  
With nothing to mar our joy  
  
I would say such wonderful things to you  
There would be such wonderful things to do  
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy  
  
A garden of Eden just made for two  
With nothing to mar our joy  
  
I would say such wonderful things to you  
There would be such wonderful things to do  
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy

Eat At Home
Paul McCartney
----------------
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat at home.  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat at home, eat at home, eat at home.  
  
Bring the love that you feel for me  
Into line with the love I see,  
And in the morning you'll bring to me love.  
  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, now don't do that.  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, now don't do that, do that, do that.  
Ah, ah, ah.  
  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat in bed,  
Eat in bed, eat in bed.

Fairly Local
Twenty One Pilots
----------------
I'm fairly local, I've been around  
I've seen the streets you're walking down  
I'm fairly local, good people now  
  
I'm evil to the core  
What I shouldn't do I will  
They say I'm emotional  
What I want to save I'll kill  
Is that who I truly am?  
I truly don't have a chance  
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat  
And repeat yesterday's dance  
  
Yo, this song will never be on the radio  
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral  
The world around us is burning but we're so cold  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
  
I'm fairly local, I've been around  
I've seen the streets you're walking down  
I'm fairly local, good people now  
  
I'm not evil to the core  
What I shouldn't do I will fight  
I know I'm emotional  
What I want to save I will try  
I know who I truly am  
I truly do have a chance  
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat  
To avoid yesterday's dance  
  
Yo, this song will never be on the radio  
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral  
The world around us is burning but we're so cold  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
  
I'm fairly local, I've been around  
I've seen the streets you're walking down  
I'm fairly local, good people now

Sisters Of Mercy
Leonard Cohen
----------------
Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone.  
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on.  
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song.  
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long.  
  
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control.  
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul.  
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned:  
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned.  
  
Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them.  
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem.  
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn  
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem.  
  
When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon.  
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon.  
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night:  
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right,  
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.

Ride It On
Mazzy Star
----------------
Ride it on baby,  
Into my view  
Ride it on baby,  
Into your side  
Ride it on baby  
Just like you used to do  
Did you want me to love you, well,  
I'm just here for the call  
And you said that you're so low, well,  
I won't really do you any harm  
Won't you ride it on baby,  
Just like you used to do  
There's no love that you're over feeling  
And you still want to be with me  
But you're leaving like you said that you would  
I'm waiting for the call  
And you love like you always say now  
But you know it won't do you any harm  
Ride it on baby,  
Just like you said that you would  
Oh then ride it on baby,  
Just like you know it's understood  
Ride it on baby,  
It's still into your view  
Ride it on baby,  
I only want to be with you  
I'm dreaming that you're going far,  
And you lie, take and whine  
Won't you ride it on baby,  
But you're so heavy for the price  
Ride it on baby,  
Just like you said that you would

This Is My Party
Fabolous
----------------
"This Is My Party"  
  
[Intro: Fabolous]  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x3]  
F-A-be  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]  
F-A-be  
Hey-hey-hey yo [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Ain't no tellin' what this hip lowered do to me  
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now  
Dip-low immunity  
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me  
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly  
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V  
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe  
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me  
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?  
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry  
So when I ask "you want to leave the zip-code?"  
Say "sure" and be me  
  
[Chorus 1: Fabolous]  
But this is my party  
Stroll by if you want to  
Or y'all can stay home  
But why would you want to?  
  
[Fabolous]  
We gon' party, till we laid in graves  
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves  
Then scream "hey-hey-hey yo"  
That groupie made her wait  
Cause when she seen the whips and chains  
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon  
  
[Chorus 2: x2]  
This is my party  
So get fly if you want to  
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to  
Put your hands up as high as you want to  
And if it feels good scream "hey-hey-hey yo"  
  
[Fabolous]  
I don't know about y'all  
But we doin' it over here  
All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here  
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here  
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here  
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear  
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this  
You see why we asks is to see ID  
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access  
Me I relax this (easy)  
Cause I'm used to ballin'  
You could tell that these guys need practice  
But if it was a problem then I would confront you  
You saying "over" bet ya I say "you want to"  
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put  
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look  
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook  
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale  
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell  
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell  
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well  
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail  
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail  
The Street Family speed off six SL's  
To all them chicks at Yale "hey-hey-hey-hey yo"  
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well  
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell  
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view  
Girl I know that these guys say they want you  
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday  
Same hoes from yesterday  
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday  
Her hang-overs yesterday  
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today  
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Hey-hey-hey yo  
Hey-hey-hey yo

Fare Thee Well
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
Oh, fare thee well, I must be gone  
And leave you for a while.  
If ever I go I will return  
If I go ten thousand miles.  
  
If I go  
If I go  
If I go ten thousand miles.  
  
Ten thousand miles it is so far  
To leave me here alone  
While I may lie lament and cry  
And you'll not hear my moan.  
  
And you  
No, you  
And you'll not hear my moan.  
  
The crow that is so black, my love,  
Will change its colour white.  
If I ever should prove false to thee  
The day will turn to night.  
  
Oh the day  
Yes, the day  
Oh the day will turn to night.  
  
The rivers never will run dry  
Or the rocks melt with the sun.  
I'll never prove false to the boy I love  
Till all these things be done.  
  
Till all  
Till all  
Till all these things be done.

Chris Brown

Haha what's up ladies  
How ya'll doin'  
Yea I know what y'all need  
All of y'all  
And that's y'all gangsta boo right  
Come on  
Mmm  
Yea... Yea  
Oh no no  
  
It was 6 o'clock on the dot  
That's when I seen this cutie  
She was chillin' at the spot  
She was wit her girls  
I was wit my boys  
All of a sudden  
I asked her to come over and say  
"Wot up ma  
How'd you like to get to know me?  
I'm not shy  
I'll do anything for you and  
I'm that guy  
Say I pick you up at eight  
I promise I won't be late"  
  
[Girl] 'Cause all I ever wanted was  
Someone I could hold on to  
Someone who would never break my heart in two  
[Chris] can I be the one for you?  
[Girl] lets sing out and let's see  
  
Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo)  
I told her that I'd call her (it's true)  
I'm not looking for the love but  
I think that you're the one  
So come on come on  
Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo)  
Someone who can spoil her (it's true)  
I'm not looking for the love but  
I think that you're the one  
So come on, come on  
  
I never met no-one like you before  
But I gotta take this chance  
Cause if I don't I'll never know  
What this girl is really looking for  
I may not have all the money (so who cares)  
I may not have all the fancy cars (I'd still be there)  
But what I have to give you baby  
Is so much more  
  
[Girl] 'Cause all I ever wanted was  
Someone I could hold on to  
Someone who would never break my heart in two  
[Chris] can I be the one for you?  
[Girl] lets sing out and let's see

Someone who can spoil her (it's true)  
I'm not looking for the love but

So come on, come on  
  
Hey shorty you're the one  
Nice lips thick hips  
Put me on  
Too tough come on girl

Breakerfall
Pearl Jam
----------------
There's a girl on a ledge she's got nowhere to turn,  
Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned,  
Now her life is on fire, it's no one's concern,  
She can blame the world or prey till dawn  
  
But only love can break her fall,  
Break her fall,  
Yeah, only love can break her fall, fall.  
  
It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth,  
And she's standing outside hating everyone here,  
Yeah, she's her own disease, crying to her doll,  
  
But only love can break her fall,  
Break her fall,  
Only love can break her fall. Yeah.  
  
Yeah fall, the world is her fall, break her fall,  
Love, love, love can break her fall,  
Now only love can break her fall,  
Love, love, love can break her fall, fall,  
Love, love can break her fall,  
Only love can break her.

Lord, I give myself, I trust in You,  
Mighty God, My Saviour.  
And Your mercy and love overflows  
And my soul rejoices.  
  
Lord, show me Your ways, guide my steps,  
Lead me to You righteousness.  
And the light of Your love  
Takes my fear away  
'Cause I know You walk before me.  
  
Oh, my Shepherd,  
You let me rest in Your arms,  
You comfort me.  
And everywhere that I go  
I'm not alone, Mighty God,  
I know, You're with me.  
And everywhere that I go  
I'm not alone, Mighty God,  
I know You're with me.

Sin
Megadeth
----------------
He had an unfamiliar face  
Complete life in disarray  
A simple man, power drunk  
No worries of living, no more anything  
Deep inside I've seen it rise  
Actions progress to no end  
Mirror, mirror please look inside  
Do you see the reasons that we sin  
Not one to be forgot  
Spoiled rotten, so they say  
Once burned, forever marked  
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay  
Pressure coming down  
Down on me, gonna break  
Broken fingernails  
Digging in, scratch my face  
Nervous, like a cat  
Gonna jump through my skin  
Shadows on the wall  
Stretching out, grope for me  
Reasons, deep in me  
Let me be  
Let me bleed  
Set me free  
The reasons that we sin  


this is the end of the song

Territories
Rush
----------------
I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth  
Like the Chinese call the country of their birth  
We all figure that our homes are set above  
Other people than the ones we know and love  
In every place with a name  
They play the same territorial game  
Hiding behind the lines  
Sending up warning signs  
  
The whole wide world  
An endless universe  
Yet we keep looking through  
The eyeglass in reverse  
Don't feed the people  
But we feed the machines  
Can't really feel  
What international means  
In different circles  
We keep holding our ground  
Indifferent circles  
We keep spinning round and round  
  
We see so many tribes -- overrun and undermined  
While their invaders dream of lands they've left behind  
Better people -- better food -- and better beer  
Why move around the world when Eden was so near?  
The bosses get talking so tough  
And if that wasn't evil enough  
We get the drunken and passionate pride  
Of the citizens along for the ride  
  
They shoot without shame  
In the name of a piece of dirt  
For a change of accent  
Or the color of your shirt  
Better the pride that resides  
In a citizen of the world  
Than the pride that divides  
When a colorful rag is unfurled

Boy step a little closer  
Cause I don't think you've heard these words before (yeah)  
Lay me left and rock me right, baby lift me up so high  
Take me to another world (ye-yeah)  
  
'Cause no one else will do (woo)  
Don't wanna be by myself  
I wanna be dancing with you  
  
'Cause you're my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left  
  
Run the beat and blow my speakers  
And make me feel like I'm the only girl (yeah)  
The way we move is so in time  
I'm the rare, got the skills to blow my mind  
They don't make 'em like you no more (ye-yeah)  
  
I'm in heaven now, so in love  
Lay your weapons down, and turn it up  
Up, up, up, up (wooh)  
  
And be my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left  
  
Can you save me?  
Can you set me free?  
'Cause I need to feel alive  
Oh we have to survive  
  
'Cause you changed me  
And now I believe  
And I need to feel alive  
Oh we have to survive  
  
Stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control (let me lose control)  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left

Last night, I had a beautiful dream  
Last night, in the wee wee hours, oh yes  
Had a beautiful dream  
Ain't about my childhood sweetheart  
How true and real it seemed  
  
I had dreamt we was walkin' Hand in hand, home from school  
Yeah, I dreamt we was walkin' together  
Hand in hand, home from school

I'd broke my mother's rule  
  
Yeah, you was only sixteen  
So young and yet so fine  
Yeah, you was only sixteen  
So young, yet so fine  
You said when you'd finish school  
You'd let me take and make you mine  
  
Oh yeah  
Yeah, you had those same pretty eyes  
Same sweet little smile  
You had those same pretty eyes  
Same sweet little smile  
I had dreamt about the sweet things  
We used to do, when you was a child  
  
You were my childhood sweetheart  
Love you now, and loved you then  
You were my childhood sweetheart  
I love you now and I loved you then  
And when I'll leave you down the twilight  
I'll go to sleep and dream again

I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
Oh what heartache  
Oh what heartbreak  
Following me  
Calling to me

That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness  
  
See what I've prayed  
Hear what loves sings  
Sad melodies  
Enticing me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness

Long Ago And Far Away
Rod Stewart
----------------
Dreary days are over  
Life's a four leaf clover  
Sessions of depressions are through  
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true  
  
Long ago and far away  
I dreamed a dream one day  
And now that dream is here beside me  
Long the skies were overcast  
But now the clouds have passed  
You're here at last  
  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Aladdin's Lamp is mine  
The dream I dreamed was not denied me  
Just one look and then I knew  
That all I longed for  
Long ago was you  
  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Aladdin's Lamp is mine  
The dream I dreamed was not denied me  
Just one look and then I knew  
That all I longed for  
Long ago was you  
  
That all I longed for  
Long ago was you

Big Wheels
Electric Light Orchestra
----------------
I've been thinking it over  
So many times they say  
You got it made  
They never understand  
The answer lies within your soul  
'Cause no one know which side  
The coin will fall.  
  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning, turning...  
  
Save it for a rainy day  
For when the cold wind blows  
Just to see how they run  
I thought they'd know  
I tried my best, all I could do  
But somehow it was not enough for you.  
  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning, turning,  
Turning, turning...  
  
I remember the dead of night  
A lonely light that shines upon the window  
I see it all so clear  
The tenderness, the silent tears  
Out here in the pouring rain  
Through cold dark waiting days  
I see you standing there  
I see the big wheels turning  
Never ending, on and on they go.  
  
I think I'm going home  
I think I'm gonna have to start again  
It's rather sad  
Because I've looked around, can't seem to find  
Whatever's always rolling through my mind  
  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning, turning  
Turning, turning...  
  
I remember the dead of night  
A lonely light that shines upon the window  
I see it all so clear  
The tenderness, the silent tears  
Out here in the pouring rain  
Through cold dark waiting days  
I see you standing there  
I see the big wheels turning  
Never ending, on and on they go.

Hopelessly Devoted To You
Grease
----------------
Guess mine is not the first heart broken,  
My eyes are not the first to cry,  
I'm not the first to know there's  
Just no getting over you  
I'm Hopelessly Devoted To You  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm out of my head  
Hopelessly Devoted To You  
Hopelessly Devoted To You  
  
I know I'm just a fool who's willing  
To sit around and wait for you  
But baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my heart aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
  
My head is saying fool forget him  
My heart is saying don't let him go  
Hold on to the end that's what I intend to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you

Young Girl
Pharrell Williams
----------------
(You know)  
(You know listen to me)  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl  
  
(Thats true, so true)  
(You're the only girl I love to)  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world  
  
(So true, so true, listen)  
  
I wasn't tryin to lead her on  
See I didn't wanna be alone  
But when she smiles she braught me home  
So I brought her home,  
Its not that the fealin of love is gone  
Cant expect a car little girl to be grown  
I cant give a fuck what so and so says  
Crushes hurt both ways  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!  
  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young  
Young girl, so in love with you  
  
The single girls are out tonight  
But you have one word, my heart, one life  
And I'm not lookin' around  
So why you lookin' down  
(What you lookin' down for?)  
  
I fucked up a long time ago  
See I should have never let you know  
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say  
(As the people magazine)  
And crushes hurt both ways  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!  
  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you  
  
[Jay-Z]  
Hove got a young girl  
Hove got a young girl  
Still not quite 21  
So high string  
Such a vibrant thing  
I introduce myself, (hi miss thing)  
You're 19?  
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow  
The scene that follows  
Screams of horror  
Classic Steven King novel  
Momma don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance  
You should just wait  
Poppa don't preach  
Hov don't bight  
Hopin' threw it I might mo your life  
Cause ima show you right  
Proper etecit how to hold your knife  
Keep it competitive with Opras ice  
Be like Janet (take control of your life)  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(young girl)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do (young girl)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(young girl)  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
(young girl)  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!  
  
[Chorus]  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(To young, I'm never to young)  
Young girl, so in love with you  
(Cause I'm never to young)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(To young, I'm never to young)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(Cause I'm never to young)  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
(To young, I'm never to young)  
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do  
(Cause I'm never to young!)  
  
My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!  
  
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do  
Young girl, so in love with you

Smells Like Teen Spirit (Live)
Avril Lavigne
----------------
Load up on guns  
Bring your friends  
It's fun to lose  
And to pretend  
She's over bored  
And self assured  
I know, I know  
A dirty word  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now, entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yah  
  
Hey  
  
Hey  
I'm worse at what I do best  
And for this gift I feel blessed  
Our little group has always been  
And always will until the end  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yah  
  
Hey  
  
Hey  
And I forget just why I taste  
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile  
I found it hard  
It's hard to find  
Oh well, whatever, nevermind  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
  
A denial(x9)

I Love You Too Much
Bee Gees
----------------
You say you don't need me  
I know where your love goes  
You go missing after midnight  
I should know better and the bed is cold  
And if you think I'm not the real thing  
I don't want to die of hunger  
I got my world created for you  
But you don't stay  
Not my imagination no more  
I can't be dealing with the bad girl  
Lives in your head  
You got your someone I , don't cry  
You go and take a strangers love instead  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
You know I love the way you do it  
When you do it right  
You ain't no one man woman  
Were you ever  
If you don't come back running  
When you've had enough  
And baby , you got it , I want it  
Show me what's left of your love  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
I won't be no dirty weekend  
I stay with you for good  
He can be your outside lover  
I've got eyes  
I know he's in your blood  
Just let me hold you for the hour  
I go where you lead me  
I need some inspiration from you  
I'm ready for the mystery , take me  
Don't let me fall  
Don't let me drown down here in the rain  
There is no alibi , don't lie  
You love a stranger and the world is pain  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)

Dead Ringer For Love
Cher
----------------
Meat Loaf feat. Cher - Dead Ringer For Love  
  
Meatloaf: Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar  
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car  
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
alrededor
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Cher: Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint  
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point  
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do  
But a girl she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
Cher and Meatloaf: Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
alrededor
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Meatloaf: Ooh you got the kind of legs that do more than walk  
Cher: I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk  
Meatloaf: Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see  
Cher: You got a lotta nerve to come on to me  
Meatloaf: You got the kind of lips that do more than drink  
Cher: You got the kind of mind that does less than think  
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely and my defenses are low  
Why don't we give it a shot and get it ready to go  
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction  
I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action  
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint  
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point  
Meatloaf: You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby, baby, baby  
  
Cher and Meatloaf: Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don? T mean a thing when I compare? Em next to you  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
alrededor
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Dead ringer for love  
Dead ringer

Love Is A Beautiful Thing
Tina Turner
----------------
Been so long since I left you  
Do all the things you used to do  
In all this time I can't forget you  
Everywhere I turn I think of you  
And I, I want to trust you baby  
You, you're all I need  
Soul to soul, Fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Baby it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Love is such a sweet emotion  
I want to share it all with you  
With your trust and endless devotion  
There ain't nothing in this world we can't do  
Tonight, I want to thank you baby  
You, you make my life complete  
Soul to soul, fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Maybe it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Tonight, I want to thank you baby  
You, you make my soul complete  
Soul to soul, fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Maybe it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing

Rock 'n' Roll Tonight
Cheap Trick
----------------
When I drove into that parking lot  
For the first time peepers round was on the dot  
By the stink of that cop, ain't got a lot  
Well we were lookin' for a place to play  
We high-tailed over to one-eyed Jack  
With a cheap guitar strung over my back  
Well I looked pretty nervous, I can't turn back  
This guy was everything the driver said, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
Well lazy Jack, doesn't move too well  
Play it back real loud, a real rebel yell  
Buy a rock and roll record and make it sell  
I'm gonna make it to the top today  
Now I got pulled in some big demand  
And they all keep telling me be a one-man band  
Unless I get big stuff and a real cool band  
And boy you gotta hear me play, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
Well they heard some sounds in the songs we wrote  
Welcome back by paying you note for note  
Been a long time playin' that rock and roll  
Not a thing's gonna touch me now  
Gonna rock your town if anybody could  
Drive a big limousine down to Hollywood  
Even bought a nice home in your neighborhood  
But we have to keep the curtains drawn  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's got her jeans too tight  
We were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight, rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight

They All Went To Mexico
Santana
----------------
Where's my pal, where's my friend  
All good things must have an end  
Sad things and nothings  
On and on they go  
I guess he went to Mexico  
  
Chorus:  
They all went to Mexico  
Buenas dias, got to go  
Tengo que obedecer  
Mi corazon  
They all went to Mexico  
Where's my mule, where's my dray  
Straw hat's packed up and gone  
lejos
Mule don't go north and dray go slow  
They both went to Mexico  
Where's my sweetie, where's the face  
That lit dark corners every place  
She put up with me long time you know  
And then she had to go to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
  
where's my brown dog, where's my hound  
He liked my truck he hung around  
But he's a canine romeo  
And I guess he went to Mexico  
Where's that woman so sweet, so mean  
Her heart was cautious her mind was keen  
She was always looking for the peccadillo  
I hope she went to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
  
Where's December's happy crew  
With German bikes and sidecars too  
They take the truck south to St. Louis, MO  
Motorcycle all the way to Mexico  
Where's my luck, where's my grace  
Has it all been just a foolish chase  
Every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow  
I think it might be time to head to Mexico

Let Her Go
Dan Fogelberg
----------------
A bad situation right from the start  
She played me for a fool and she broke my heart  
An infatuation, a hard loss to take  
But we all must make our own mistakes  
  
Let her go  
I knew I had to let her go  
You know it wasn't easy  
It was painfully slow  
But I swear I finally let her go  
  
All of those feelings were so long ago  
I haven't felt a thing since I let her go  
But you don't believe it  
You still have your doubts  
And while you do the tension mounts  
  
Let her go  
You know you got to let her go  
You know it's never easy  
It's painfully slow  
But you know you got to let her go  
  
I will not deny it, I tried to hold on  
But human hearts can only stay broke so long  
I told you the truth, how much more can I do  
And now my love it's up to you  
  
Let her go  
You know you got to let her go  
You know it's never easy  
It's painfully slow  
But you're gonna have to let her go  
  
Let her go  
You know you got to let her go  
You know it's never easy  
It's got to be slow  
But you know you got to let her go

Longer Look
Widespread Panic
----------------
The longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
Every time I hear your voice  
Sweeter is the song  
  
Each glanced borrowed from your eyes  
Deeper is the story  
Wind burns your sleeping breath  
And waters become one.  
  
Longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
  
Your hair brushed me lightly  
Twice before we met  
Years between familiar moments  
Heaven since  
  
Memories like photographs  
Never knew were taken  
Sun drenched snows from separate hills  
Their waters become one  
  
The longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
  
The longer I look at you  
The fairer

Back Up
Pitbull
----------------
(Chorus)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold Diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 1)  
I'm in the cut in the club  
Scopin the scene  
Cup half way full  
Smokin the green  
She got her hand on my nuts  
What does that mean?  
Pointed at her friend  
And she said, they'll tag team  
Now who said dreams don't come true  
Its like I'm dreamin  
When I come through  
I always find something to run through  
Speak into the mike mami  
Mic check one two  
Drunk in the club  
Off the chain  
But who gives as fuck?  
That's why I came  
So pour it up  
And get down  
Ya'll have no choice  
But to listen to Pit now  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 2)  
Everybody knows  
Pit's got tight raps  
When I'm in the club  
DJs bring it back  
With no questions asked  
But the number one question is  
"Does he got cash?"  
Lil Jon's at the bar  
While me and them eastside boys smoke out  
Roll another one  
Sin duda
Get a couple hoes  
Roll out  
Beef, you don't want none  
To go down  
dumb diddy dumb dumb  
My times now  
The city I'm from  
Is covered with federals  
That'll make your crew run run  
Your crew run run  
Its next to come  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 3)  
I convince mami to creep on the DL  
Even though my head spinning  
Like some sprewells  
Skip the details  
Its the vodka bottom line  
that's testin my patience like doctors  
I'm not impressed by the cool shit  
Or those chains or that ice or them cars  
All that's bullshit  
If that's what your lookin for  
Keep lookin hoe  
Cause you got the wrong one bitch  
I'll let you know  
Mami's like damn  
That Cuban's shot out  
Bitch I came to the club  
To wild out  
If you came to act up  
Then you need to get from me bitch  
And back up  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

Love Child
Happy Mondays
----------------
You bore me, you bore me you teach me,  
You taught me, you see me, you want me, you buy me, then torch me,  
You enter and walk me the thing that came out of my mouth sweet mouth when I
leave this  
Old house I should have a good day should  
I have a bad should I get something out  
See what I've had can I stay a young man or grow old  
And fat don't need a microphone to say I know bout this and  
I don't need a microphone to know where it's at well  
I got a duster but I don't have a flat how should we cook this'  
Should we let it boil lets make a love child we both can spoil give it a dee  
Use the kindest oil we have to find some good land get the good soil how
should we cook this'  
  
Should we let it burn  
We both need a wise up we both need to learn the things  
That come out of your mouth sweet mouth when I leave  
This safe old house should it be a good thing or should it be  
Here's something dying baby  
But I got to go out your need on the inside  
Where a man like that can shout  
So if you thinks that's evil  
Shake it up and about get to the tip top take a tall look out  
So a leader of people doesn't know what it's  
About just wants to be a big man has the urge to whip it out  
Well I sold it you bought it you spread it you caught it you  
Don't have to have a big dick  
T makes you feel proud I got to find a high point get it out  
For the crowd you bought me, you bore me you tease me,  
You taught me you feed me, you fought me you see me then you want me who you b
Me,  
Then touch me you enter and walk me should I have a good day  
Or is it bad should I get some of the things out  
See what I've had there's something dying baby but I gotta get out

Hemingway's Whiskey
Kenny Chesney
----------------
Hemingway's whiskey, warm and smooth and mean  
Even when it burns, it'll always finish clean  
He didn't like it watered down, he took it straight up and neat  
If it was bad enough for him, you know it's bad enough for me  
  
Hemingway's whiskey  
  
Ah, it's tough out there, a good muse is hard to find  
Living one word to the next, one line at a time  
There's more to life than whiskey, there's more to words than rhyme  
Sometimes nothing works, sometimes nothing shines  
  
Like Hemingway's whiskey  
  
Sail away, sail away, three sheets to the wind  
Live hard, die hard, this one's for him  
  
Hemingway's whiskey, warm and smooth and mean  
Even when it burns, it'll always finish clean  
He didn't like it watered down, he took it straight up and neat  
If it was bad enough for him, you know it's bad enough for me  
  
Hemingway's whiskey  
Hemingway's whiskey  
Hemingway's whiskey

The Moma Dance
Phish
----------------
And all throughout I gaze and glimpse you  
Loving never did convince you  
I see you when you're all alone  
It's like a person I've not known  
  
The moment ends though I feel winds  
Blowing differently than ever before  
And they're pushing me further from shore  
  
A frothy cap the steady slap  
Of lines against the rail  
A biting rain take in the main  
  
Up the rigging take in sail mind the skipper we'll not fail  
He'll bring out wine all will be fine just hear the order watch the sail  
The moment ends

God Is My Santa Claus
Hank Snow
----------------
In a class room at the grade school just before the Hollidays  
Boys and girls were writing notes to Santa far away  
Expect a lad who sat alone his paper put away  
And when his teacher asked him why so softly he did say  
Oh God is my Santa Claus each and every day  
I don't write him letters ma'm I just kneel and pray  
Don't you know his greatest gift salvation is afound  
God is my Santa Claus each day the whole you're round  
  
Then the teacher stood in silence after what the child had said  
He really knew real Christmas day and not from books he'd read  
He truly met real Santa Clause he said him just one word  
God gave his praise for Christmas day my Santa Clause is God  
(God is my Santa Claus each and every day  
I don't write him letters ma'm I just kneel and pray)  
Do you know his greatest gift salvation is afonud  
God to be my Santa Claus each day the whole you're round

Fall Dog Bombs The Moon
David Bowie
----------------
Hope little girl  
Come blow me away  
I don't care much  
I win anyway  
Just a dog  
  
I'm God damn rich  
An exploding man  
When I talk in the night  
There's oil on my hands  
What a dog  
  
Fall dog is cruel and smart  
Smart time breaks the heart  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
  
Devil in a market place  
Devil in your bleeding face  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
What a dog  
  
There's always a moron  
Someone to hate  
A corporate tie  
A wig and a date  
Just a dog  
  
These blackest of years  
That have no sound  
No shape, no depth  
No underground  
What a dog  
  
Fall dog is cruel and smart  
Smart time breaks the heart  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
  
A devil in a market place  
A devil in your bleeding face  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
What a dog

Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
I tumble into space, try to stop the fall  
My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space  
  
Could have floated  
  
I stumble 'round my home  
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one  
Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down  
My friends are aliens and I've been down  
Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life  
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces  
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down  
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down  
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out  
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own  
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down  
My friends are aliens and I've been down  
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in and deals and I've

Amazing Grace
Celine Dion
----------------
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but not am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils, and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
  
And when this flesh  
And heart shall fail  
And mortal life shall cease  
I shall possess  
Within the vale  
A life of joy and peace  
  
(coor)  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright, shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we first begun  
  
(Celine)  
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but not am found  
Was blind but now I see

So Long
Allman Brothers Band
----------------
So long, I hope our paths meet again some day.  
Oh, but who's to say, who's to say, where or when?  
And I'll be hopin' that it'll be real, real soon.  
Yeah, I'll be hopin' that you'll be there sharin'  
My little cozy bedroom.  
We've been together down that long and lonesome road.  
The happiness we've shared was through each other  
And it's a doggone shame such a beautiful thing,  
Should have to fade away,  
Not too many people ever had what we had,  
To throw it all away is oh, so sad. So long, so long.  
So long. I believe our paths may cross again.  
And I thank the Lord, thank the Lord,  
that this time we parted friends.  
So for this time, so long, so long, so long, so long.

Low Down Dirty Mean
Allman Brothers Band
----------------
[Chorus]  
Ain't that low down, low down dirty mean  
The way you've been treatin' me,  
Beats all I've ever seen.  
  
I loaned you my brand new car,  
Said you was goin' for a Sunday drive,  
Yeah, here it is now four days later,  
I don't know if you are dead or alive,  
  
I got on the telephone this morning,  
Put the word out on the street,  
And I heard you was down in Memphis,  
With a big man in the driver's seat.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got me a hidin' in the bushes,  
Peekin' in the window pane,  
Shadow moves along the wall,  
I know you're in there with another man,  
  
Tried to get in the front door,  
Went around to the back door too,  
I believe you've got a side track man in there,  
Making my sweet love to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Makin' my last proclamation,  
Gonna lay it on the line,  
Baby I'm runnin' out of patience,  
And you are runnin' out of time,  
  
Tired of all of your mean things,  
And all your dirty tricks,  
If I ever turn on you baby,  
You're gonna be in some kind of fix.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah so low down, I know, low down dirty mean, ah!

Standing Right In Front Of You
Keith Urban
----------------
Out on the street corner  
Just like every morning I sit here  
And I watch you walk my way  
And even though I don't know you  
As you get closer I swear I feel  
My heart start racing, aching  
Maybe it's in my mind  
And maybe I'm only dreaming  
And I swear you catch my eye  
As you walk on by  
Oh why you gotta leave me so blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby why can't you see  
That I'm the only one for you  
You could search the world over  
But you'll never find another so true  
'Cause if you're looking for love  
I'm standing right in front of you  
  
(I'm standing right in front of you)  
  
I bet your heart, like mine  
Has been broken by someone  
We never should have given it to (oh no)  
So we put up a wall to keep from falling so hard  
It's so sad  
'Cause there's such good love inside  
And I've been hoping that I might find  
Someone who feels the same way  
Someone to share my life  
On this beautiful ride together  
We could see it all through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Standing right in front of you)  
  
So this morning I'm just going to walk up, and say hello to you  
'Cause if given a choice between love and being alone  
I know which one  
I know which one I choose  
And give me a chance  
I'd be a better man for you (I believe I would)  
And open your heart girl  
Let me make your dreams come true  
  
You can search the world over  
But I can take it to the moon  
'Cause if you're looking for love  
I'm standing right in front of you (yes I am)  
Standing right in front of you  
(Standing right in front of you)  
Open your eyes, (I'm standing right in front of you)  
Just give me a chance baby  
(I'm standing right in front of you)

Take Care
Backstreet Boys
----------------
I, I've waited all my life  
To step out from the light  
And see the shadows fading.  
You, you've always stood so tall  
I've never thought you'd fall,  
  
But now it's you that's fading!  
Pre-Chorus:  
I know that inside you're delicate  
But you say that  
You don't need someone to take care of you, but  
Chorus:  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Oh, oh, oh so you want, there's no need to want  
Stand up face to face the stage  
Up high, but we'll reach higher!  
I will tell the soul if you cry  
I can hold you, why you're crying now?  
Pre-Chorus:  
I know that inside you're delicate  
But you say that  
You don't need someone to take care of you, but  
Chorus:  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Take care of you!  
I know that inside you're delicate  
And, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
Baby, baby, baby  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Take care of you!

Hold On
Reba Mcentire
----------------
Hold on cause this feels just like a first love  
There's no way to rehearse love  
We'll just learn as we go  
  
I know you can see it in my eyes  
I've been looking in your eyes  
The feeling is starting to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on  
Love can take us up so high  
But it can take us down so low  
You either laugh or you cry  
Hold on  
Cause love's a chance that we're taking  
And I don't think we're mistaking  
We'll never know till we try  
  
Hold on  
Cause here comes all the conversations  
The painful midnight confessions  
That leave you feeling so sad  
  
I know we can make it forever  
If we just face it together  
Take the good with the good  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Summer Night City
ABBA
----------------
Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city

Magpie
Blur
----------------
I was angry with my friend  
I told my wrath, my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
I told it not, my wrath did grow  
And I watered it in fears  
Night and morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smile  
And with soft deceitful wiles  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And it grew both day and night  
Till it bore an apple bright  
And my foe beheld it shine  
And he knew that it was mine  
And into my garden stole  
When the night had veiled the pole  
In the morning, glad, I see  
My foe outstretched beneath the tree  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
I was angry with my friend  
I told my wrath, my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
I told it not, my wrath did grow  
And I watered it in fears  
Night and morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smile  
And with soft deceitful wiles  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie  
And sometimes I  
See magpie

Stompin' At The Savoy
Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
[Chorus:]  
Savoy, the home of sweet romance,  
Savoy, it wins you at a glance,  
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance,  
To dance...  
  
Your form, just like a clingin' vine,  
Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine,  
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine  
Divine...  
  
How my heart is singin',  
While the band is swingin',  
Never tired of rompin',  
And stompin' with you, at the Savoy  
  
What a joy, a perfect holiday,  
Savoy, where we can glide away,  
Savoy, there let me stomp away,  
With you.  
  
[Repeat chorus]

Vincent
Josh Groban
----------------
Starry, starry night  
Paint your palette blue and grey  
Look out on a summer's day  
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul  
Shadows on the hills  
Sketch the trees and daffodils  
Catch the breeze and the winter chills  
In colours on the snowy linen land  
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
  
Starry, starry night  
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze  
Swirling clouds and violet haze  
Reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue  
Colours changing hue  
Morning fields of amber grain  
Weathered faces lined in pain  
Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand  
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
  
For they could not love you  
But still your love was true  
And when no hope was left inside  
On that starry, starry night  
You took your life as lovers often do  
But I could have told you vincent  
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you  
  
Like the strangers that you've met  
The ragged men in ragged clothes  
The silver thorn of bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow  
  
Now I think I know  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They're not listening still  
Perhaps they never will...

Strangers In Love
Air Supply
----------------
Strangers in love must a star fall from the sky  
It's stranger than most and stranger when we try  
To understand it all, why we fall,  
As strangers in love,  
Strangers in love.  
Straight from the farm and a world apart and ready for-  
Someone to take her arm, she's never seen a movie  
  
What an innocent face, what an innocent place.  
It's natural, it's an easy thing to do,  
Natural, it's an easy thing to do.  
Strangers in love and a star fell from the sky  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn.  
Strangers in love

Organic Acid
Kate Bush
----------------
He got her drunk very quickly  
Holding hands, they found the broom-cupboard  
Where he had control as far as the fall  
When his hand covered wet hair  
She took over among furniture wax  
Dust, and the cloying yellow of polishing-cloth  
When he was sick, she comforted him  
  
Oh hush, my friend, and sleep  
And cuddle to the wind  
Sleep on through the waves  
That may wet your lover's dream  
  
We have been far through this night long hours  
We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh...  
  
He couldn't do it properly  
The disco, the office, the pub,  
Had left out those details of delight.  
Satisfied, he would collapse out,  
Puzzled at why she still squirmed,  
Held onto him, tears curling into her mouth  
This was something their stories always omitted  
That her joy would seem like pain  
When he focused after his release.  
  
Do sand and shells and stones  
Peep in through your night?  
But you should not be hurt  
For all will pass with time.  
  
We have been far through this night long hours  
We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh...  
  
In the third week of the relationship  
She was tripping on organic acid  
Would stop to pick up a rained-out leaf  
Would give it tenderly into his hand  
Full of dead things before they reached the car  
  
When they drove she sat with mouth open  
As though photographed on the impact of a stomach punch  
Her right fist gripping the skin of his left leg  
  
Hooking the steering-wheel closer to his heart  
He feared her, and slapped out sideways into her face  
She entered the cut with her tongue  
Gurgling gratitude for the strange taste  
  
Do you fear the dark?  
Then hush, and realise  
That though the angels never come  
Prayers can soothe your mind  
  
We have been far through this night long hour  
We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh...  
  
There was no premonition of the wet Hog's Back  
The sportscar slumped, snout into a beech  
Their corpses giving the vehicle arms  
Petrol and blood at last dripping together  
But quick flashes of a planned lunch  
Cold red beef, white cloth by a cherrywood fire  
Game pie, and for him two pints of colder beer  
The winter air tucking under their eyelids  
As they spun on the gravel at Clandon  
Their hands steaming from quick moisture  
The aromatic finger drawn up to his nostril  
Dazed after mutual masturbation  
They zigzagged into a conservative end  
  
Oh hush, my friend, asleep

Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that

Maybe I'm to good to hood low down no good  
I just keep shit real just like you should,  
Twist my fingers throw up my hood

They say young fell off yeah the boy done lost it  
Been porting all my life baby I'm just exhausted  
I take a Gatorade break to get everything straight  
Now I'm sitting here like how much Gatorade make  
How much money would it take to make some mo money  
Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo from me  
I sold millions made them millions  
But still yaw doubt me what's this with out me  
Can't be that bad still got my trap swag  
And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag  
Money in trash bags

It looks like garbage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get allot of that allot of this

Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it

It just might shock you  
If you can't find Chaka then my right hands keep it  
Look I am simply on of the best  
Can't even lie i can't vouch for the depressed  
Just like zip-lock they get killed in the plastic  
Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic  
I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic  
When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic  
They say that I'm difficult even different  
Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference

Murders In The Rue Morgue
Iron Maiden
----------------
I remember it as plain as day  
Although it happened in the dark of the night.  
I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain.  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
There's some people coming down the street  
At last there's someone heard my call  
I can't understand why they're pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all.  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyone's shouting at me  
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain  
And like a fool I started running away.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free.  
  
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.  
All France is looking for me.  
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I can't erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me, well  
I just start running blind  
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day they'll be looking for me  
'Cause I know I show the signs of...  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and I'm getting so tired  
I'm running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
It'd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that it's on my mind  
That my doctor said I've done it before.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
They're never gonna find me  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.

Women And Wine
Proclaimers
----------------
A hundred years ago  
I thought happiness was ice cream and football.  
But time went by so fast  
Till I couldn't see their attractions at all.  
I looked around for other pleasures.  
The old man had shown the way then.  
Just in time I found women and wine.  
  
I marvelled at the way that they united men  
For the working and middle and upper classes.  
You didn't need any brains  
Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies.  
I'm not basking in reflected glory  
But open any book and I think you'll find that  
The greatest men of all time  
Loved women and wine  
Or men and wine.  
  
Ah, they'll be the death of you  
If something else doesn't get you first.  
  
Well I'm older now  
And have to take my pleasures in moderation.  
Least that's what it says here in this guide to  
Declining years in declining nations.  
But just 'cause I've slowed up a bit  
Doesn't mean I can't cheer from the touchline.  
I hope sons of mine  
Spend lots of time  
On women and wine,  
Women and wine.

I Have Nothing
Glee
----------------
Share my life, take me for what I am  
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you  
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much  
Just all that you are and everything that you do  
  
I don't really need to look very much further  
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow  
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside  
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide  
  
Don't make me close one more door  
I don't wanna hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you  
  
You see through, right to the heart of me  
You break down my walls with the strength of your love  
I never knew love like I've known it with you  
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to  
  
I don't really need to look very much further  
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow  
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside  
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide  
Your love I'll remember forever  
  
Oh, don't make me close one more door  
I don't wanna hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
  
Don't make me close one more door  
I don't wanna hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me, no  
Don't walk away from me  
  
Don't you dare walk away from me  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
If I don't have you, you, you, you  
If I don't have you, oh oh

Cash
Patti Smith
----------------
Here we go around again Curve of life spiraling  
Everything we've ever known As the seed of life gets blown  
And the miracle of time When will that time just end  
Remember, you decide Take that vow  
Grab that ring It's not a whim  
Not a whim When you be cashing in  
  
Try to turn your life around And all the things you do resound  
And then you can't loose control Say your time has come and then  
Hard to pinpoint find the seam Where that one time ends  
Where that time begins Remember, you decide  
Take that vow Take a stand  
Grab that ring It's not a whim  
It's not a whim It's only time  
That you're cashing in  
  
In the white noise of desire We can't hear a single thing  
Floating round the fragile bough Afflictions of the human soul  
Its beauty immaterial  
  
You decide Stand along  
The fallen ones Take revenge  
Defeated sons Rend that coat  
From seam to seam It's only time  
It's only time That you spend  
You spend It's only time  
You spend Its only time  
You spend It's only life  
That you're cashing in

Hoola Hoop

Somewhere in the hiearchies Mr Big picks up his horn  
Floats a note down to the lowlands and another star is born  
Then he turns another billion and he deals a little porn  
Hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop  
  
I ain't never been to art school but I kinda like Picasso  
All his women look Egyptian but then what the hell do I know  
He's a No 1 attraction like a bottle to a wino  
You could say he was a hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop  
  
If you're bound to be a big star then you better do it right  
Got to get yourself an agent and a healthy appetite  
For some overpaid attention and a lot of neaon lights  
That right and you can be a hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop  
Somewhere in the hiearchies...

The Rhythm Of The Pourin' Rain
Vince Gill
----------------
Bolt up the windows, lock all the doors  
Try to remember what a body is for  
There's bad weather comin', the red eye's runnin' red  
Let's spend the weekend and never leave that bed  
Turn out the lights like there's no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Let's tell ol' Monday mornin', "Please don't come too soon"  
The storm is still raging right here in this room  
Oh, what a sweet way to spend our time  
Still got a little taste of some real good wine  
Turn out the lights like there's no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Oh, what a feelin's gonna fill my brain  
Next time the weatherman says it looks like rain?  
Turn out the lights like there's no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Turn out the lights like there's no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain  
Makin' love to the rhythm of the pourin' rain

I'm Only Jesus
Tim McGraw
----------------
Bobby's got a duster '79  
Bottle of Jack and a forty-five  
Points it at his head  
And he starts to cry,  
To proud to ask me to save his life  
  
Billy's in a limo  
On the upper east side  
Playing Russian Roulette  
With the long white line  
His wife gets a call at three am  
Saying billy ain't never coming home again  
  
She asks me why?  
  
And I said,  
I sure wish you'd believe  
That everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sunshine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Johnny had a good job  
Rackin' it in  
Caviar parties  
With his well to do friends  
Something was missing  
From his perfect little life  
He through in the towel  
And he called me one night  
  
Betty was an orphan  
Like so many kids  
They taught her in school  
That I didn't exist  
She had every reason not to talk to me  
But every night before bed  
She got down on her knees  
Just to tell me hi  
  
And I said,  
I'm sure glad you believe  
Cause everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Hey your all the same to me  
Everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
I'm only Jesus  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Gotta have Jesus to see the light  
Gotta have Jesus to hold you tight  
Gotta have Jesus to talk to me  
I gotta have Jesus to set me free

What A Day
Faith No More
----------------
A piece of mail  
A letterhead  
A piece of hair  
From a human head  
  
They're stayin' to me  
"I should've killed it"  
"I should've killed it"  
"I should've killed it before"  
  
You're right, you're right  
"Kill the body and the head will die"  
They're laughin' at me  
"I should've learned it"  
"I should've learned it"  
"I should've learned it before"  
  
What a day, what a day  
If you can look it in the face  
And hold your vomit  
  
A wet sneeze and a "no left turn"  
A row of teeth and an encouraging word  
Beneath a mile of skin  
"I should've noticed it"  
"I should've noticed it"  
"I should've noticed it before"  
  
What a day  
What a day  
What a day  
Don't you touch it

Strollin' Down The Highway
Nick Drake
----------------
Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
People think I'm a crazing  
Lot about how they're-a-lazing  
Sunshine's all day long  
Narcotics far too strong  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
Cars won't stop for no one  
But don't you think that you're just rolling down  
Think you are a spy  
Gonna shoot them as they go by  
Well, no cars  
No cars  
Won't stop for no one  
  
Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway

If I Should Fall Behind
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
We said we'd walk together baby come what may  
That come the twilight should we lose our way  
If as we're walkin a hand should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
And should I fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side  
We'd help each other stay in stride  
But each lover's steps fall so differently  
But I'll wait for you  
And if I should fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true  
But you and I know what this world can do  
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
If I should fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead  
There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed  
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees  
I'll wait for you  
And should I fall behind  
Wait for me  
Darlin' I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind  
Wait for me

Stranger Than The Stranger On The Shore
Squeeze
----------------
Acid casualties and angry young men  
The litmus test of a guitar and pen  
Revolve around date sheets lost lonely rooms  
And this is my home and I will leave soon  
For a house with a tower  
Where there's visiting hours  
And the day leaves its taste on a spoon  
The black eye of the camera bruised by my blush  
Leaves another chin and another hair cut  
The image in focus the shot aims to kill  
And I'm cropped at the waist as I run through the mill  
So I'm lost for an encore  
The Kodachrome wants more  
Now I'm snapped with my head in the still  
  
The contract's been signed with a stroke of my blood  
I'm drowned by the name that sinks in the mud  
Thrown from emotion to swim back to the shore  
Where the sound of a drum beats time to applause  
Now my life's in danger  
Of ending up stranger  
Than the stranger who walked on the shore  
  
Stranger than the stranger  
Who walks by my bed  
Shares in my life  
Lives although dead  
Stranger than the stranger I am sure  
Stranger than the stranger on the shore

Don't Try So Hard
Queen
----------------
If you're searching out for something  
Don't try so hard  
I you're feeling kind of nothing  
Don't try so hard  
When your problems seem like mountains  
Feel the need to find some answers  
You can leave it for another day  
Don't try so hard  
  
But if you fall and take a tumble  
It won't be far  
If you fail you mustn't grumble  
Thank your lucky stars  
Just savor every mouthful  
And treasure every moment  
When the storms are raging round you  
Stay right where you are  
Oooh don't try so hard  
Oooh don't take it all to heart  
It's only fools they make these rules  
Don't try so hard  
  
One day you'll be a Sergeant Major  
Oh you'll be so proud  
Screaming out your bloody orders  
Hey but not too loud  
Polish all your shiny buttons  
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton  
But you never had to try  
To stand out from the crowd  
  
Oh what a beautiful world  
Is this the life for me  
Oh what a beautiful world  
It's the simple life for me  
Oooh  
  
Oh don't try so hard  
Oh don't take it all to heart  
It's only fools they make these rules  
Don't try so hard  
Don't try so hard  
Don't try so hard

All Stand Up
Status Quo

All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
Working all week till Friday  
Wish I could do it my way  
Until when I'm living it up  
I ain't giving it up  
Making the best of my lot  
One of these days when I stop  
And I'm gonna be living it up  
I won't be giving it up  
Telling you now it's my day  
Oh I'm gonna do it my way

All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
The job it just drives me crazy  
Guess I'm a little lazy  
I don't care 'cause what do they know  
They'll be there when I go  
Every day feel like screaming  
Nothing gonna stop me dreaming  
And there's one thing sure that I know  
I can't wait for the whistle to blow  
Telling you now it's Friday  
I'm gonna do it my way  
  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never

All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
Living and loving and learning  
Gotta keep the whole world turning  
So come on let's give it a try  
No use in wondering why  
Running away and hiding  
Taking our time and finding  
If we stop then it's all gonna go  
Don't wait for the whistle to blow  
Everyday feel like screaming  
Nothing gonna stop me dreaming  
  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
All hands up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say never say never say never say

Ballad Of Cleo And Joe
Cyndi Lauper
----------------
Every day the clock kicks off the beat.  
Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet.  
Waits in his platforms for the right train to come.  
Sipping his coffee another day has begun...  
Little Joe got work for minimum wage.  
Tries to get through another dead beat day.  
At five o'clock he comes home to change,  
Takes him many hours just to rearrange...  
And he works his body just to be somebody.  
There's a woman in the mirror looking like a dream.  
And he works his body...  
And he feels somebody...  
And the working boy becomes a dancing queen.  
Every night the dj kicks off the beat.  
Little Cleo's jumping just to get up on her feet.  
Waits in her platforms for the right song to come.  
Sipping her cocktail another night has begun.  
And he works his body just to be somebody.  
There's a woman in the mirror looking like a dream.  
And he works his body...  
And he feels somebody...  
And the working boy becomes a dancing queen.  
Every morning the clock kicks off the beat.  
Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet.  
Waits in his platforms for the right train to come...

Don't Take It Personal
Ne-Yo
----------------
Shoulda known it when I met you  
Everybody was trying to tell me  
But you had me blinded  
It's all good though  
Now I understand...  
  
Verse 1:  
What you did was shady, girl  
Thought you were my lady, girl, that's why  
I straight made you girl  
Gave you all the finer things in life  
Homie said to stop the flow  
Told me you were nothing but a ho  
I ignored him though  
And you took me through for sho  
  
Chorus  
I guess this must be why  
Most guys (Don't get personal)  
Just when we decide  
It's all right (We get left alone)  
And even though I try, I can't hide  
(What I'm going through)  
Thought you would be mine, only mine (and I fell hard for you)  
  
Verse 2:  
I guess I shouldn't even trip  
Homie said get over it, I've tried  
But I can't forget  
How you had me open for your lies  
Every other girl I meet  
Can't even trust, because I've seen  
What you've done to me  
Ain't no telling when I'd be ready  
  
Chorus x2  
I remember when, you said I was your only man  
But I'm wiser now, and I'll never hurt again  
Getting over you, if it's the last thing that I do  
No, we can't even be cool  
I don't need a friend like you  
  
Chorus x3 til fade

Alone This Holiday
Used
----------------
Maybe light a candle  
Don't say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
'cause I'm gone  
I left you  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday  
  
Said, It's cold in this town  
And there's snow on the ground  
Far from home  
Not alone  
I left you with nothing  
And that's what you own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday  
  
Maybe light a candle  
Don't say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
'cause I'm gone  
I left you the best time  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday

Bad News
Johnny Cash
----------------
Ha ha ha come on bad news ha ha  
  
Well bad news travels like wildfire, good news travels slow  
They call me Ol' Wildfire, 'cuz everybody knows  
That I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go  
  
From north to south, east to west the story is the same  
From one state to another, I have to change my name  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls that hate to see me go  
  
Now they tried to hang me down in Oakland and they did in Frisco  
But I wouldn't choke and I broke their rope and they had to let me go  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go  
  
I've picked peaches in Georgia, lumberjacked up in Maine  
I've been hired and fired and put in jail in every state you can name  
'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go  
Always gettin' in trouble  
And leaving little girls who hate to see me go

Strange Fire
Indigo Girls
----------------
I come to you with strange fire  
I make an offering of love  
The incense of my soil is burned  
By the fire in my blood  
I come with a softer answer  
To the questions that lie in your path  
I want to harbor you from the anger  
Find a refuge from the wrath  
  
This is a message  
A message of love  
Love that moves from the inside out  
Love that never grows tired  
I come to you with strange fire  
Fire  
  
Mercenaries of the shrine  
Now who are you to speak for god  
With haughty eyes and lying tongues  
And hands that shed innocent blood  
Now who delivered you the power  
To interpret calvary  
You gamble away our freedom  
To gain your own authority  
  
Find another state of mind  
You know it's time we all learned  
To grab hold  
Strange fire burns  
With the motion of love  
  
Fire  
Fire  
  
When you learn to love yourself  
You will dissolve all the stones that are cast  
Now you will learn to burn the icing sky  
To melt the waxen mask  
I said to have the gift of true release  
This is a peace that will take you higher  
Oh I come to you with my offering  
I bring you strange fire  
  
This is a message  
A message of love  
Love that moves from the inside out  
Love that never grows tired  
I come to you with strange fire  
Fire  
Fire  
I come to you with strange fire

It's Not For Me To Say
Billie Holiday
----------------
It's not for me to say you love me  
It's not for me to say you'll always care  
Oh, but here for the moment I can hold you fast  
And press your lips to mine  
And dream that love will last  
As far as I can see this is heaven  
And speaking just for me  
It's ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again  
But then, it's not for me to say  
  
And speaking just for me  
It's ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again  
But then, it's not for me to say

I pump poison  
Into my body  
To forget  
That I am me  
  
se siente bien
Wonderful  
I forget I have feelings at all  
You're dizzy  
  
I floated up  
Fifteen miles high  
Stuck my head through  
All the holes in our sky  
  
I looked out across the universe  
And thought of you  
You're dizzy  
And I am dizzy too  
  
I became lunatic  
With rolling eyes  
Squirming on the ground  
Frozen in ice  
  
Called to my mother  
Said "Mother, please  
Feed me before the sky  
Falls in on me"  
  
You're dizzy

She's That girl (yeah), who dances everywhere  
Like I don't care, She's so excited  
And I'm that guy, that loves the women - girl can be herself

And I'm that guy, to let her do it  
And her friend, is at the life she spent to be herself

Got a? Boy shorts, and long boy socks  
She's having fun  
She didn't do it for people to watch  
She's number one  
And her mind in the club, she didn't come for love  
She came to party, party, she came to party, party  
C'mon  
  
Now she don't worry bout what people think bout her cause she fly  
When everbody on the floor goes left and then she goes right  
Now I think that it's possible for the beat, dance it all night  
All night long

Full Circle
Miley Cyrus
----------------
I've been in a rut  
Back and forth enough  
Heart like the wheel  
Without you around  
So uncomfortable is how it feels  
  
Every time you're near  
Trouble disappears  
Under the ground  
But when you go too far  
Silver clouds will start hanging around  
  
And I know why  
Try to run  
But I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
And I can't jump the track  
Can't let you go  
  
Tied to one  
So I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
Skippin' down a broken path  
How long can I last  
Please let me know  
Where's the finish line  
Cause I've got to find somewhere to go  
  
I don't want to hear  
These people interfere  
What do they know  
What I feel inside  
When I'm up all night  
Needing you home  
  
I don't know why  
Tried to run  
But I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
And I can't jump the track  
Can't let you go  
  
Tried to once  
So I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
I'll keep on runnin?  
Til we meet in the middle  
I'll push it right aside  
And I give just a little  
There's miles to go  
But wait  
Don't hold back  
We'll make it  
  
And I know why  
Tried to run  
But I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
And I can't jump the track  
Can't let you go  
  
Tried to once  
So I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
Yeah I know you'll come around  
You'll come around

Prisoner
Uriah Heep
----------------
Time has come to say goodbye  
To the broken memories  
They're locked inside like prisoners  
In a place that no-one sees  
  
Stayed up late with a friend of mine  
Southern comfort till dawn  
We talked about the pains of love  
Should've known from  
The start you were wrong  
  
I'm just a prisoner  
Don't wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner, I get so lonely, lonely  
I'm a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you, out on you  
  
Tired blood runs through my veins  
But I can't get no sleep  
You lock my heart  
In these prison walls  
This place I've got to leave  
  
I'm a prisoner  
Don't wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner, I get so lonely, lonely  
I'm a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you, out on you  
  
The sky is gray, it's raining  
Like the storm in my heart  
There ain't no use explaining  
'cause I'm leaving, leaving  
  
Won't somebody set me free  
Take me away from this misery  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely  
Won't somebody set me free  
Please, please, set me free

They say numbers don't lie  
Bitch, I'm not the one  
Hammers in ya face, this is not a dream  
And you get in every page in this magazine  
Bumping ugk, talking about a murder  
We roll a Dr. Jay and then we light that Julius Erving  
I got p-ssy on the way and p-ssy on the way out  
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out  
Tunechi, Tunechi, toaster, tooly  
F-ck around and pop ya  
My homies got that white girl  
Call it Lady Gaga  
Glock for Tini, nina colada  
Suck, swallow, semen, saliva  
I'm going at your collar  
F-ck you hoe niggas!  
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure  
Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a f-cking dope dealer  
You're a dead man walking: Michael Jackson Thriller  
I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches...

Toaster, tooly, f-ck around and pop ya  
  
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]  
Back where I started on my set, in black  
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque  
We don't pack extra clips, we pack extra Gats  
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats  
Til the wheels fall off: I can fix a flat  
If you're scared go to church and get a scripture tat  
Guns the size of children, now don't be childish  
Be with wild-ass niggas and I am the wildest.  
I'm a motherf-cker, call me Weezy baby  
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato  
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady  
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady  
I got the world in my hands, skateboard n' my vans  
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran  
I know what I can do, so bitch I do what I can  
Drop the Sorry 4 the Wait, man  
I'm just saying...  
  
I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches...

Mama, I'm dying of a heart attack, heart attack, heart attack  
I love that girl, but she don't love me back  
My girl, she tells me that we're breaking up, breaking up, breaking up  
My heart can't handle the strain that's shaking it  
  
She tried to tell me not so long ago  
I would not listen but now I know  
  
Papa, I'm drinking for an overload, overload, overload  
The gun in my pocket is all ready to explode  
Papa, I'm dying of an overdose, overdose, overdose  
I tried to warn you, don't come too close  
  
I tried to tell you way back when we were young  
I tried to warn you there was something wrong  
Mama, I'm dying  
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying

Family Man
James Taylor
----------------
Woah, Jocko, don't expect me  
To come out drinking, messing around.  
Spending my time with a bunch of crazy people.  
Yes, I been there before,  
I don't need to go back no more.  
I'm just a family man, like it or not,  
I am a family man.  
I'm a-holding onto what I've got.  
I'm a family man,, right by damn.  
Finally, find out what I am is a family man.  
  
And don't expect me to hit the road  
At a moment's notice without my suitcase  
With some crazy bunch of strangers  
In some unknown car,  
Well, I'm just not willing to go that far.  
  
The life I used to lead was a little too frantic. I guess I just got eyes to
grow old and grey.  
And if what I have in mind isn't super romantic,  
I guess I always saw myself this way,  
I'm just a family man, like it or not,  
Said I'm a family man, holding onto what I've got,  
I'm a family man, right by damn,  
I finally, find out what I am is a family man.  
  
Sears and Roebuck.  
Howard Johnson.  
Colonel Sanders.  
Station wagon.  
Briggs and Stratton.  
Second mortgage.  
If I can ever lose my blues.  
Walk on over and turn on the TV.  
What I'd like to do is  
Lie down on the sofa later on.  
I might walk my dog, baby.  
Bo Diddley's a family man.

Ahh ooo ooo  
Get around round round I get around

You Are My Home
Vanessa Williams
----------------
All of my life  
I been searching  
For someone to find me  
I have been looking  
Waiting for your arms  
To pull Me  
  
You took Me  
In from the cold  
And out of the dark  
You have taken Me  
Into your heart  
  
Chorus  
  
You are my home  
You are the one that I come to  
You are the shelter I run to  
To keep Me safe from the cold  
You are my home  
You are the love  
That completes me  
You are the touch  
That has freed Me  
I look in your eyes  
And I know  
You are my home  
  
You were the light in the window  
When I couldnt find my way  
You led my heart to  
Want them to place me  
Here besides you  
  
You are where I always will be  
You are where I belong  
I've been looking for you  
For so long  
  
You are my home  
You are the one that I come to  
You are the shelter I run to  
To keep Me safe from the cold  
You are my home  
You are the love  
That completes me  
You are the touch  
That has freed Me  
I look in your eyes  
And I know  
You are my home  
  
And I'll never be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, You are my home  
  
I look in your eyes  
Te miro a los ojos  
Why me haces sentir  
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby  
You are my home  
You are my home

It Must Be You
Tom Jones
----------------
The sun is shining, it's everywhere  
Don't have no worry, don't have no care  
It must be true, this is the season  
Baby it must be you  
It was raining the other day  
But that lonely feeling has gone away  
It must be true, it's so pleasing  
  
It must be you  
That's what they say, in those old storybooks of old  
You light my way and you satisfy my soul  
  
It must be magic, it must be love  
Oh what could I have been thinking of  
It's the reason I'm feeling so blue  
  
It must be you  
Well that's what they say, in those old storybooks of old  
You light my way and you satisfy my soul  
  
It must be magic, it must be bliss  
Oh it must be rain on a night like this  
It must be true, that's the reason I think  
It must be you  
It must be you  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, b-b-b-b-b-b-baby  
It must be you  
I really do believe, it must be you  
Baby, baby, I really do believe, really do believe, really do believe

Valleys Of Neptune ... Arising
Jimi Hendrix
----------------
(June 7, 1969)  
  
1.  
I feel the ocean swaying me ...  
washing away all my pains.  
See where I was wounded,  
Remember the scar ?  
Now you can't see a thing ...  
And I feel no pain --  
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets  
Green and blue ... Canyons too  
Singing about Atlantis love songs.  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.  
  
2.  
  
Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining  
Telling me where I came from --  
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he  
lays in -- ... on the Burning  
edge Horizon.  
  
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...  
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --  
See the wind make love to all  
the ocean ... Joy spread and  
the massage got home --  
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...  
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord  
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --  
  
3.  
  
Look out East coast, but you're  
gonna have a neighbor,  
A rebirth land ...  
the praying Burning Sands.  
  
We know there were worlds  
so much older ...  
And they shall rise, and  
tell us much more the truth of man --  
  
4.  
  
I see visions of sleeping peaks  
erupting ...  
releasing all hell that  
will shake the Earth from end to end --  
And this ain't bad news, good news,  
or any news ... it's just the truth,  
Better save your souls while  
you can --  
  
Singing about the New Valleys  
of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean,  
the world is gonna be ...  
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.

Forever
Chris Brown
----------------
One, two, three, four  
Hey (eh) forever, hey (eh) forever  
  
It's you, and me  
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)  
Tonight, is the night  
To join me in the middle of ecstasy  
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music around you (around you)  
  
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there  
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby  
We can go anywhere, go anywhere  
But first, it's your chance  
Take my hand, come with me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like I waited my whole life  
For this one night

Double your pleasure, double you fun  
And dance forever ever ever  
Forever ever ever, forever ever ever, forever (forever)  
Ever ever ever, forever ever ever, forever ever ever  
Forever on the dance floor  
  
Feels like we're on another level  
Feels like our loves intertwine  
We can be two rebels  
Breakin' the rules  
Me and you, you and I  
All you gotta do is watch me  
Look what I can do with my feet, baby  
Feel the beat inside  
I'm drivin', you could take the front seat (front seat)  
Just need you to trust me (trust me)  
Girl girl girl, it's like now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a long way down  
We so high off the ground  
Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart  
Girl where did you come from?  
Got me so undone  
Gazin' in your eyes got me sayin'  
What a beautiful lady

Just One Way To Say I Love You
Perry Como
----------------
I love you, I love you, there's no other way  
Just one way to say "I love you"  
I love you, I love you, and, try as I may  
That's all I can say - "I love you"  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say "I love you"  
  
There's no other way  
Just one way to say "I love you"  
  
And, try as I may  
That's all I can say - "I love you"  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say "I love you"

Better
Chris Brown
----------------
[Verse 1: Tyga]  
I love women and power, we used to sit and talk for hours  
On the balcony, my condo play your favorite, shawty  
No love lost, just the perfect soulmate, that's all  
It's my fault, caught in a rupture  
Should've been you I was touchin', I knew it wasn't  
My ego, I was buzzin' but not how you wanted  
Too busy tryna flaunt it, like I just bought it  
You know them bitches 'round you can't hold water  
This s'posed to be our moment  
These pills set it, I'm feelin' better  
Called you to tell you I love you  
But you too busy with some other shit, I'm guessin'  
No texts, no proof, no voice messages  
How we become enemies so effortless?  
Or was I blind when you was naked?  
Or high when you was level  
Know time is of the essence  
No lie, I live and regret it  
Decisions I made, embedded in my mind  
Hate to admit it, but I gotta say it one time  
  
[Hook: Chris Brown]  
Should've treated you right  
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane  
I should've put my focus on you  
In the club every night  
I just get it wrong when you do right  
And I keep just fillin' your head with the lies  
This shit comes with a price  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
What happened to me, babe?  
This ain't who you fell in love with  
You say you need space  
Don't do this  
Just look at me, one more time  
I know I fucked up but I'm tryin' to please you  
I'ma give you all  
And your heartache and pain's gonna stop  
Baby right here  
Don't walk away  
There is no one left to call  
Don't wanna be alone when you disappear  
I know I hurt you more than three times  
Now you need me time  
Fuck I'm s'posed to do in the meantime?  
Then she told me "figure it out"  
  
[Hook]

My Heart Cracked
Randy Travis
----------------
You're spreadin lies all over town about the way you brushed me off and put me  
Down I'm her to say make no mistake my heart cracked but it did not break I  
Can't deny the hurt was deep the way you slammed that door and walked right
fuera
On me but I'm telling you get one thing straight my heart cracked but it did

Break shatterd dreams lay every where broken promises are all we share I  
Finally took all I could take my heart cacked but it did not break well I was  
Blue but for long cause this brand new love I got has made me strong and I'm  
Over you and all the ache my heart cracked but it did not break shattered  
Dreams lay everywhere broken promises are all we share I finally took all I  
Could take mty heart cracked but it did not break

Where Did The Feeling Go?
Air Supply
----------------
All alone  
Nothing to do  
It's lonely here  
Without you  
  
The candle light is burning low  
A love song's on the radio  
And memories are all I have to show  
  
Photographs  
Tickets for two  
Promises  
That all fell through  
  
Now everything's in black and white  
The colors faded with the night  
The stars we used to wish upon  
Have somehow lost their light  
  
Where is the feeling we used to know  
Where is the music that played  
Oh, what happened to the love  
That used to show  
Where did the feeling go  
  
A cigarette  
A glass of wine  
A paperback  
To pass the time  
  
As I lie awake tonight  
I'll leave the porch light burning bright  
And miss the loving arms  
That used to hold me tight  
  
Where is the feeling we used to know  
Where is the music that played  
Oh, what happened to the love  
That used to show  
Where did the feeling go

Get It Up
Aerosmith
----------------
Take me on your rocking horse  
Hit the lights and shut your doors.  
Grab your ankles , everyone.  
Ain't my way of having fun.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up,give it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, get it up, for your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
For your fantasies  
My ass don't speculate.  
I'm just your slave, your master's bait.  
And lots of luck into the night.  
Just waitin' for the bright light fright.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Really have a good time  
Really have a good time  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath her clothesline.  
Really have a good time.  
Love me til the sun...  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up,  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, gotta get it up, get it up, get it up,  
For your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
Get it up and down and all around.  
Take a ride and paint the town.  
Slow me down and make it fast.  
Scream almost and make it last.  
You know you gotta really have a good time.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath the her clothesline.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
You know you really want to love me till the sun can't get it up. Get it up.

He'll Never Know
Cher
----------------
They go off and leave me behind  
They have so many words to find  
I run to catch a glimpse of them  
  
Just walking in the sun  
Knowing they'll be mine again  
When the evening has begun  
And when I see them hand in hand  
The boy who walks beside the man  
I pray that I will always have the world  
  
That I have found  
The husband and the son  
That I built my life around  
  
He'll never know of that night long ago  
He'll never know it's locked in my mind  
No he'll never know  
From the feelings I show  
He'll never know  
His son is only mine  
  
Sometimes I lie awake at night  
Watching darkest turn to light  
Thinking back on all the things  
I said to him today  
Wondering if I might had a careless word to say  
When the morning's almost here  
He reaches out to draw me near  
Silently I search his face for the love  
I hope to see and once again  
I'm sure that all his love belongs to me

Gold
Spandau Ballet
----------------
Thank you for coming home  
I'm sorry that the chairs are all worn  
I left them here I could have sworn  
These are my salad days  
Slowly being eaten away  
Just another play for today  
Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you  
Nothing left to make me feel small  
Luck has left me standing so tall  
  
[Chorus:]  
Gold (gold)  
Always believe in your soul  
You've got the power to know  
You're indestructible  
Always believe in, that you are  
Gold (gold)  
Glad that you're bound to return  
There's something I could have learned  
You're indestructible, always believe in...  
  
After the rush has gone  
I hope you find a little more time  
Remember we were partners in crime  
It's only two years ago  
The man with the suit and the face  
You knew that he was there on the case  
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall  
  
Gold (gold)  
Always believe in your soul  
You've got the power to know  
You're indestructible  
Always believe in, 'cause you are  
Gold (gold)  
I'm glad that you're bound to return  
Something I could have learned  
You're indestructible, always believe in...  
(Gold)

Back In Time
Kyla
----------------
[Jay R]  
How have you been  
The last time I saw you  
We graduated high school  
I can't believe it's been 2 years since then  
  
[Kyla]  
I've been okay  
Nothing much has changed  
Still doing the same old thing  
  
[Jay R]  
Oh may I take a little bit of your time  
  
[Kyla]  
No, I don't think that would be possible  
  
[Jay R]  
Why do you have a boyfriend  
  
[Kyla]  
No, I broke it off 2 months ago  
  
[Jay R]  
If you don't mind  
I'd like to get your number  
And maybe reminisce together  
Is that alright?  
  
[Kyla]  
I don't mind  
Would love to get together (No doubt)  
In fact tonight I'd rather (Yeah)  
Go back in time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
  
[Jay R]  
Now here we are  
Tell me everything about you  
Where you go the things that you do  
The things you like whatever is on your mind  
  
[Kyla]  
I just bought a house  
Been half way 'round the world  
Still not your ordinary girl  
  
[Jay R]  
I've always have had a little crush on you  
  
[Kyla]  
I can't believe you felt that way too  
  
[Jay R]  
And after all this time I still think I do  
  
[Kyla]  
Boy for now just take me where  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day (Hey)  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Just follow the signs (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
  
[Jay R]  
Girl I'm glad you came tonight  
  
[Kyla]  
What made you think I'd decline  
  
[Jay R]  
I haven't seen you in a while  
Still have that pretty smile  
  
[Kyla]  
I see you still haven't changed  
Still have your flirty ways  
  
[Jay R]  
Well, I can't help it with you  
You make me wanna go  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Just go back in time  
  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day (Back in the day)  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Just follow the signs (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (I wanna go back go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back go back)  
Let's go back in time

Chinese Arithmetic
Faith No More
----------------
Candle light, it burns in every hole of your eyes  
It's beautiful, how much you'll never realize  
So hush my love, there's something I'm to tell you now  
Your time has come, around again my sleepless one  
Your friend was young, hung and plastered  
He never knew his own disaster  
I think it's good, in fact it was faster  
Cause it was you that he was after  
Hold me now, as if you'll never let me go  
Unhand me now, as if you've always known my name  
His love was king, his love was master  
He needed more, he needed always  
He searched in vein for love and shelter  
In every soul, in every hallway  
So you thought she'd be sweeter than your girlfriend Peter  
Well give it a second chance cause you've yet to meet her  
We got the same ideas, we got the same old fears  
They're different colors sometimes, but, hey, who cares?  
Just years that tears our lives apart  
Just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk  
He couldn't do it-push!-you told him twice  
Well, I do man but it just don't jive  
Tried so hard to control my behavior  
I tried so hard, so hard to believe you  
But now I live only to deceive you  
So KICK and SCREAM!!!

One Of You
George Strait
----------------
Last night I had a dream, dreamt I had it all I had it all  
I had one truck, one car  
One boat, one guitar  
But all these things wouldn't get me too far  
If I didn't have one of you  
  
I work hard every day to bring home all my pay  
I got one house, one yard  
One dog who likes to bark  
We'd be cold, living the dark if I didn't have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
[Chorus]  
This is what I have, you have it all  
I got one heart, one love  
One dream I'm dreaming of  
Wouldn't have known what to give it all to  
If I didn't have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
[Chorus]

For The Cause
Planetshakers
----------------
You gave Your all for me  
Came as a ransom to set me free  
Love so amazing, divine  
Your blood she'd on Calvary for all mankind  
  
I stand in awe  
Of the wonder of Your Love  
I stand in awe of You  
  
For the cause of Christ I will lay down my life  
  
For the cause of Christ I will stand  
I will give my all to give him glory  
For the cause of Christ I live  
  
I will worship  
Jesus my King of all glory

Haunted House
Bee Gees
----------------
I know baby's bad for my self-esteem.  
Find another face for your sympathy.  
Some of us cry, some of them lie,  
but no one sees inside.  
  
The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone.  
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone.  
Sounds of the night.  
Streets without light.  
And baby's not alone.  
  
Try to hold her to myself.  
Someone else is breaking all my dreams. Ella
needs so many games to play.  
One more time I climb the stairs.  
Open up the door and she was gone.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter).  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
And the smile is no longer there.  
The face and the eyes and the hair.  
Nothing stands the test of time.  
You live forever, never mine.  
I cling to dreams that turn to sand.  
Our life is now a distant land.  
  
We commit emotional suicide.  
Every single room is electrified.  
Your memory shadowing me.  
The house where sorrow hides.  
  
Pull it down, blow it up.  
Help me send these walls of love away.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter)  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
(Like a lamb to slaughter)  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around

Last Night
George Harrison
----------------
She was there at the bar, she heard my guitar  
She was long and tall, she was the queen of them all  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night  
  
She was dark and discreet, she was light on her feet  
We went up to her room and she lowered the boom  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night  
  
Down below they danced and sang in the street  
While up above the walls were steaming with heat  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night  
  
I was feeling no pain, feeling good in my brain  
I looked in her eyes, they were full of surprise  
Last night, talking about last night  
Last night, talking about last night  
  
I asked her to marry me she smiled and pulled out a knife  
The partys just beginning she said, it's your money or you life  
Last night, talking about last night  
Last night, talking about last night  
  
Now I'm back at the bar, she went a little too far  
She done me wrong, all I got is this song  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night

Kiss The Bottle
Foo Fighters
----------------
It gets loneliest at night.  
Down at the liquor store.  
Beneath the neon sky.  
Our moonlight.  
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice.  
The pan's dried up so tight.  
With hardened beans.  
We're hungry.  
So I lean on you sometimes.  
Just to see you're still there.  
Your feet can't take the weight of one.  
Much less two.  
We hit concrete.  
How were we born into this mess?  
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby.  
But we were run out on a rail.  
Fell from the wagon to the night train.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
Cigarettes they fill the gaps.  
In our empty days.  
In our broken teeth.  
We're jonesing.  
Say mister, can you spare a dime?  
Some change could make a change.  
Could buy some time.  
Some freedom.  
Or an ear to hear my story.  
It's all I've got. My fiction  
Beats the hell out of my truth.  
A palm upturned burnt blue.  
Don't call it sunburn.  
You've been shaking on the job.  
Just one drink ahead of your past.  
There's a white light coming up.  
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.  
I kissed the bottle.  
I should've been kissing you.  
You wake up to an empty night.  
With tears for two.

Tell Me Of Spring
Air Supply
----------------
TELL ME OF SPRING  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so  
I, I'm like the worn leaf  
Blowing to and from  
Until I find my home  
You appear, I'm alive,  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
I fall to the ground  
Send my prayer to the clouds  
There are no choices  
Hear the silence of sound  
Lay your head down  
And drink from the voices  
You appear I'm alive  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)(TWICE)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so

Our Frank
Morrissey
----------------
Our frank and open  
Deep conversations  
They get me nowhere  
They bring me down, so  
Give it a rest, won't you?  
Give me a cigarette  
God give me patience  
Just no more conversation  
Oh, give us a drink  
And make it quick  
Or else I'm gonna be sick  
Sick all over  
Your frankly vulgar  
Red pullover  
Now see how the colors blend  
  
Our frank and open  
Deep conversations  
They get me nowhere  
They just bring me down, so  
Give it a rest, won't you?  
Now will you just give over?  
The world may be ending  
But look, I'm only human  
  
So, give us a drink  
And make it quick  
Or else I'm gonna be sick  
All over  
Your frankly vulgar  
Red pullover  
Now see how the two colors blend, my friend  
Won't somebody help?  
  
Won't somebody stop me  
From thinking  
From thinking all the time  
About everything  
Oh, somebody  
From thinking all the time  
So deeply, so bleakly?  
So bleakly all the time  
About everything? (Who I am, how I ever got here)  
Somebody stop me  
From thinking  
From thinking all the time  
So bleakly, so bleakly  
So bleakly all the time

Sub Pop Rock City
Soundgarden
----------------
I'm not stoned but I wanted to tell ya  
When I'm in the mood, I could think of playing there  
Going to Seattle where the rock's so heavy  
With all them sex dogs in my Chevy  
  
At the XTC, party, everybody's invited  
Cool! give it dude, we're plastic like you  
Going to a show, rock's all night  
And everyone I hate is at the party tonight  
I said Sub Pop Rock City  
  
Hola
(Jonathan Poneman) This is Jonathan  
Hey Jon  
(JP) I just want to know, what the heck's going on?  
Well you know, I have this problem  
(JP) What the heck's going on?  
Yah, okay, well do you think you'd have too much trouble if we got rid of  
our sideburns?  
(JP) At your earliest convenience  
Well, I know you've said that before, but do you think Bruce would mind?  
(Bruce Pavitt) This is Bruce Pavitt  
Bruce, I mean, kay, could we have our dollar back Bruce?  
(BP) Bye

Country Road
Dolly Parton
----------------
Saw you turnin' down main street  
In your big, black fancy car  
You were dressed up fit to kill  
With a pretty girl on your arm  
You spun around and you headed up town  
Where the neon lights all shine  
Left me choking in a cloud of dust  
You never pay me no mind  
Chorus:  
You're livin' in the fast lane  
I guess I'm just too slow  
I never wore silk or fancy furs  
Just plain ole calico  
I'll never be a fast lane lover  
And they're the only kind you take up town  
I am just a country road  
That you keep turnin' down  
If you ever hit a dead end street  
If it's love that you're looking for  
You can always turn around  
And beat a path right to my door  
Do I have to draw you a map  
You seem to know your way around  
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels  
Baby, we can go to town  
Repeat Chorus  
I'll never be a fast lane lover  
And they're the only kind you take up town  
I am just a country road  
That you keep turnin' down  
I am just a country road  
That you keep turnin' down  
Repeat Chorus

Free My Soul
Cliff Richard
----------------
I took your name you took my number  
Look me up if you're in my town  
You made a friend be sure of that  
Let me know if you're free come down  
You're making plans-things you'll do  
Said I'll be someone I'm telling you  
  
I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll  
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul  
  
We took a walk out in the grey  
You didn't speak but had much to say  
Don't talk too loud walls have ears  
Criticise and you'll disappear  
A souvenir from where you've gone  
A pair of jeans or some chewing gum  
  
I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll  
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul  
They built the wall until they had something to hide  
To keep me out or is it to keep you inside  
  
I'm gonna free me...

Amanda
Green Day
----------------
Amanda don't you know  
That I still walk around  
This foggy round about  
When I get back in town.  
I was a different man  
From five seconds ago  
And you're a different woman,  
That's for certain,  
I don't know a thing about.  
  
Is this some kind of love  
That only hate would understand?  
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.  
  
Amanda don't you know  
I wasn't strong enough  
And in your wild mind  
I wasn't smart enough.  
I was a different kid  
From fifteen years ago  
And you're a different woman,  
That's for certain,  
I wanna know about.  
  
Is this some kind of love  
That only hate would understand?  
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.  
  
I'm not playin' with your mind  
Unless you think I am.  
'Cause you're crushing my heart  
Like a battering ram.  
  
Is this some kind of love  
That only hate would understand?  
Amanda, I couldn't be your man.

I Loved Another Woman
Fleetwood Mac
----------------
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself  
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself  
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal  
  
She was a real good woman - she didn't me no harm  
She was a real good woman - she wouldn't do me no harm  
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone  
  
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong  
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong  
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more

Nobody Loves Us
Morrissey
----------------
Nine times fined  
Never mind  
Things can only improve  
We are just stood here  
Waiting for the next great wound  
  
And we just can't wait to make more mistakes  
And to fluff our breaks, and to stuff our faces with cake  
  
All in all, imagine this :  
Nobody loves us  
Dab-hands at trouble  
With four days of stubble, we are  
Never loosen the grip on our hand  
Call us home  
Kiss our cheeks  
Nobody loves us  
So we...oh...we tend to please ourselves  
  
People think all we do  
Is lie around and think of how  
Rich we'd be if we didn't think  
Life could improve  
  
And we just can't wait to make more mistakes  
And we just can't wait till the whole thing blows up in our face  
  
Call us home  
Kiss our cheeks  
Nobody loves us  
Dab-hands at Trouble  
With four days of stubble, we are  
So, never loosen the grip on our hand  
Call us home  
Make our tea  
Nobody loves us  
So we...oh...we tend to please ourselves  
  
Call us home  
Tuck us in  
Nobody wants us  
Dreamers and schemers  
All pie-eyed, and bog-eyed, and cross-eyed  
Oh, never loosen the grip on our hand  
Whack us, then  
Hug us hard  
Nobody loves us  
So we...oh...we tend to please ourselves  
  
And we just can't stress, oh, how more the mess  
And complete distress won't make much difference to us  
  
Sing us our  
Favorite song  
Nobody loves us  
Born-again atheists  
Practicing troublemakers  
Make us our  
Favorite jam  
Nobody loves us  
Useless and shiftless  
And jobless  
But we're all yours

It's Good, To Be Free
Oasis
----------------
Head like a rock spinning round and round  
I found it in a hole sitting upside down  
You point the finger at me but I don't believe  
Paint me a wish on a velvet sky  
You demand the answers but don't know why  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free  
  
So what would you say if I said to you  
It's not in what you say it's in what you do  
You point the finger at me but I don't believe  
Bring it on home to where we found  
Head is like a rock sitting upside down  
In my mind there is no time  
  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
All I want to do is live by the sea  
Yeah little things they make me so happy  
But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free  
Yeah it's good yes it's good it's good to be free

Did You Know
Don McLean
----------------
Did you know that love can grow any place where people go,  
And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me.  
The sun is high the day is new and  
I have found a place with you.  
  
Every place and every face casts a spell and leaves a trace,  
With you in mind and with you near, the myth is gone, the past is clear  
And here with scars of now and then so you and I begin again.  
  
Did you know I've been searchin'? Did you know I've been blind?  
Did you know I've been touchin' anything I could find?  
  
Did you know that here below, moving where my feelings flow,  
You live with me in time that's new, suspended in a love that's true  
And far beyond the fatal noise and bathed in all life's simple joys.  
  
Did you know that love can grow any place where people go,  
And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me.

I Got Money Now
P!nk
----------------
When I was a young buck  
I tried to be liked by  
Everyone  
Everyone  
I tried so hard to be funny and nice  
I tried so hard to be sugar and spice  
Didn't work for me  
Got old quickly  
But now I'm not losing sleep at night  
No one's calling me on the telephone  
To see if I'm at home  
Cause now I've got everything that I have ever wanted or so it seems  
Yeah so it seems yeah  
  
You don't  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
I don't care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
  
When I got a little older  
I realized  
It's all lies  
There is no prize  
There is no prize  
There is no heartache if you can afford  
Everything delivered right to your door  
Responsibilities  
This life is easy  
So now girl with everything  
How could she complain  
Cause she's got it made  
Yeah she's got it made  
I don't need to be tucked in at night  
Told that everything is gonna be alright  
Is gonna be alright  
Cause I don't have to fight  
  
You don't  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
I don't care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
  
I wouldn't trade a dollar for some sense  
I wouldn't trade a lifetime for some friends  
I've got everything  
And all is what it seems  
I worked so hard all of my life  
Just to have things I could call mine  
I don't need no love  
Cause I have got enough  
So now I don't mind being alone all the time  
It's alright  
I've got money now  
That's what it's all about  
And I'm so busy buying things and traveling the world  
I don't have time for friends  
Or family  
And that's fine with me  
So it seems  
  
You don't  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
I don't care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
  
You don't  
Have to  
Like me  
Anymore  
I've got money now  
I don't care  
What you say  
About me  
Anymore  
Cause I've got money now

Anna-Molly
Incubus
----------------
A cloud hangs over  
This city by the sea  
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be  
Out there and sober, as a well for loneliness  
Please do persist girl, it's time we met and made a mess  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do  
  
A cloud hangs over  
And mutes my happiness  
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress  
Wish you were here  
I'm a wounded satellite  
I need you now, put me back together, make me right  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
I'll call out your name  
Up into the air  
Not one of the others  
Could ever compare  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
  
Wait, there is a light  
There is a fire, illuminated attic  
Fate or something better, I could care less  
Just stay with me a while  
Wait, there is a light, there is a fire de-fragmenting the attic  
Fate or something better, I could care less  
Just stay with me a while  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
I'll call out your name  
Up into the air  
Not one of the others  
Could ever compare  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
Anna Molly (wait, there is a light, there is a fire de-fragmenting the attic)  
Anna Molly (fate or something better, I could care less, just stay with me a
while)  
  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do, do  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do, do

I Don't Have To Sing The Blues
Grand Funk Railroad
----------------
I've got this good lookin' woman back home, let me tell ya'  
She cooks good and she looks good, and she just can't do no wrong.  
She cooks me cornbread in the morning, she's my dinner and my midnight snack.  
She sits up and she begs, and she even rolls over on her back.  
  
CHORUS  
Please don't tell me that's the way that it goes, 'cause I've tried hard and I
know.  
I ain't been playin' in your back yard, 'cause I got my baby and she loves me
so.  
  
She don't treat me mean, and she loves my machine, yeah.  
I digs her 'cause she's funky, and she sure keeps it clean, now.  
I'm a loafer, she's my chauffeur, and she sure likes to drive me, uh-huh.  
I lay my life on the line, and she steps right up besides me, yeah.  
  
CHORUS  
  
I don't have to sing the blues no more.  
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure.  
She lays it on me each and every night.  
She's my pleasure and my world's delight.  
  
I don't have to sing the blues no more.  
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure.  
She lays it on me each and every night.  
She's my pleasure and my world's delight.

Jzero
Cat Stevens
----------------
Well I ain't got nothing,  
But it don't worry me.  
I came to this life like a free-walking tree.  
No need to be tied, no need to be.  
They call me Jzero.  
  
Well I ain't got nothing,  
And to nothing I belong.  
You won't find me right,  
Yet you won't find me wrong.  
If you think about me,  
Don't think too long.  
Jus' call me Jzero.  
  
Well I don't house no past,  
Never carried a key.  
My sun doesn't rise from under the sea.  
There is only one morning,  
Eternally, dee d'lee d'lee.  
  
Well he says he hasn't got nothing,  
But he seems to possess less.  
He waltzed through the door,  
Like a tapdance with death.  
What kind of fool is he?  
  
No need to guess, jus' call me Jzero.  
  
Well I don't eat a lot.  
I do work for nothing, so  
If there's a job I can fill the gap.  
I don't need a room, bed, or pillow, oh  
Once you've decided to trust me with time,  
You won't need to look back  
A doo, de, doo, de, doo.  
  
Well I ain't got nothing,  
But it don't worry me.  
I came to this life like a free-walking tree.  
No need to be tied, no need to be.  
They call me Jzero.

Fat Lenny's gonna walk right into myself  
Fat Lenny's gonna see myself (Reflect it back on myself)  
Fat Lenny's gonna lick the shellack off the window sill  
And I say Fat Lenny's gonna lick my head off  
Stop by my friend Fat Lenny, I like him a lot (Tell him about my buddy)  
He's Fat Lenny - what

And I said now Fat Lenny's gonna jump up and down (Run back down the hill)

Love Hurts
Cher
----------------
Love hurts, love scars  
Love wounds and mars  
Any heart not tough  
Or strong enough  
Take a lot of pain  
Take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud  
And it holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts  
  
You're young, I know  
Baby, what's so  
I know a thing or two  
Ooo honey, I learned from you  
I really learned a lot  
I really learned a lot  
Love is like a stove  
It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts  
  
Some fools rave, of happiness  
Of blissfulness, togetherness  
Oh, some fools,  
They fool themselves, I guess  
They're not fooling me  
And I know it isn't true  
God, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts, (ooooo) love hurts  
(Ooooo), love hurts  
  
And I know it isn't true  
Oh, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Cause love hurts  
Early in the morning you hurt,  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts

We Had It All
Vince Gill
----------------
We closed down the border cantina  
And drank margaritas till dawn  
You were my sweet senorita  
And I was your handsome Don Juan  
  
We danced like there was no tomorrow  
We laughed and we lived and we loved  
That moment in time that we borrowed  
Never did last long enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah, we had it all going our way for a little while  
We had it all right in the palm of our hands  
We had it all going our way for a little while  
Oh, how I wish we could go back there again  
  
We thought we were too young to marry  
Slowly we drifted apart  
Well baby, I miss you like crazy  
Those memories still burn in my heart  
  
Oh, let's find a way to rekindle  
That flame that burned long ago  
These days just can't hold a candle  
To those sweet nights in old Mexico  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

Give Her The Gun
Ufo
----------------
Give Her The Gun  
Downtown, drive by, a drink card in her hand  
All night hustler parking by the stand  
Full blown engine, she comes on like a fight  
Give her the gun, boy you'd better hold on tight  
I don't know why, she brings me on  
I don't know why, ooh but she brings me on  
She's a right runner, real mean mother too  
I can't wait to see her break in front of you  
Making a movie star upon the screen  
If daddy's looking, you come on like a queen  
I don't know why, she brings me on  
I don't know why, but she brings me on  
  
Downtown drive by, a drink card in her hand  
All night hustler parking by the stand  
Full blown engines she comes on like a fight  
Give her the gun, boy you better hold on tight

If I May
Nat King Cole
----------------
I'd like to love you, every day  
If I may (If I may)  
And dream dreams of you, every night  
If I might (If I might)  
And if I may, I'd like to say  
I wish that you were mine  
If I had you, all I would do  
Is adore you all of the time  
  
I'd like to tell you of your charms  
Every day, if I may  
I'd like to hold you in my arms  
Every night, if I might  
You're the object of my affections  
And if you have no objections  
I'd like to love you, night and day  
If I may

Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
Goodnight, my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me  
  
Before you go  
Please remember I need you so  
And this love I have for me  
Will never go cold  
  
If you should awake in the still of the night  
Please have no fear  
Just close your eyes  
Then you realize  
That my love will watch over you, dear, always  
  
Goodnight, my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me

White girl, white girl, night girl, night girl

Got a white girlfriend she be acting the

Running around town with them choppers about the same size

Pocket full of money and all I'm taking dollars eh  
White girl crazy, rich got lazy  
Never been a racist, a white girl pay me  
My credit card new bitch brown skin  
Duffle bag full of that green shit  
Ain't nothing like my white friend

She knows just what you like, I know just what you need  
If them white girls you like, bet I got one of your type

Hung On A Hook
Alice In Chains
----------------
Hung on a hook I'm a mirror  
Cracked down the center I split you  
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes  
  
Show you the face of a man who  
Not that he wants but he has to  
Look at the thing he's become, what I see  
  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun  
  
Pieces of me on a tile floor  
Look up at you as you change more  
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times  
  
Hold a reflection inside me  
I cannot feel you are empty  
Throw me away  
I am broken not your time  
  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun and your head  
  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia

Stay With Me
Whitesnake
----------------
Where did you go  
When things went wrong, baby,  
And who did you run to,  
To find a shoulder  
To lay your head upon.  
Baby, wasn't I there,  
Didn't I take good care of you.  
  
Oh no, I can't believe you leaving me  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on  
  
Who did you touch  
When you need tenderness.  
I gave so much  
And in return I found happiness.  
Baby, what did I do  
Maybe I was too good, too good for you.  
  
No, no, I can't believe you leaving me.  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby.  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on.  
  
Remember,  
You said you're always gonna need me,  
Remember,  
You said you'd never, ever leave me,  
Remember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you.  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on, can't go on  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, stay with me, baby.  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on

Television Man
Talking Heads
----------------
I'm looking and I'm dreaming for the first time  
I'm inside and I'm outside at the same time  
And everything is real  
Do I like the way I feel?  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the world crashes in into my living room  
Television man made me what I am  
People like to put the television down  
But we are just good friends  
(I'm a) television man  
  
I knew a girl, she was a macho man  
But it's alright, I wasn't fooled for long  
This is the place for me  
I'm the king, and you're the queen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a walk in the beautiful garden  
Everyone would like to say hello  
It doesn't matter what you say  
Come and take us away  
  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
  
And we are still good friends...(Television man)  
I'm watching everything...(Television man)  
Television man...(Television man)  
I'm watching everything...(Television man)  
Television man...and I'm gonna say  
We are still good friends...and I'm trying to be  
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say  
We are still good friends...You know the way it is  
Television man...I've got what you need  
We are still good friends...I know the way you are  
Television man...I know what you're tryin' to be  
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say  
That's how the story ends.

How Lucky I Am
Bryan White
----------------
Standing in a field of three leaf clovers  
Waiting for the rain to pass over  
No rainbows, on my shoulder  
Just the weight of walking day to day  
Nothing shiny coming along the way  
Then I saw you and I reached out  
(ain't) no more blue, now I understand why  
  
How lucky I am lucky I am  
To be the one who fills your eyes  
Blowin' away, sails on a lake  
Flyin' like a flag in the sky  
Bright colored balloons in the wind  
That's how lucky I am  
(how lucky I am)  
  
Now the road is rising up to meet me  
And my half empty cup is filled completely  
And I'm drinking that sweet taste of rain  
So grateful for each moment I get  
To have found you  
I could have walked on by  
But the stars were on my side

Do It To Me
Lionel Richie

Girl, you're such a bad thing  
Standing there all alone  
Looking so good to me baby  
Can't do no wrong (hey, baby)  
  
Put your arms around me  
Set my world on fire  
There ain't never gonna be nobody like you baby  
Honey, that's no lie (hey, honey)  
  
You put that spell on me  
I'll tell you, honey  
You know you set me free  
Hey, little girl you know my hearts desire  
Come on and give it to me, baby  
I can't deny ya!  
  
Hey, hey, what I'm sayin' is

Do it to me one more time, baby  
Can't get enough of your love!  
  
Oh, you're my Motown lover  
Girl of my dreams  
When you laugh, when you cry  
Girl, that look in your eyes  
You're my everything, oh baby,  
Oh baby, oh baby

Whoa, oh, my friends say I'm a dreamer  
It takes a fool in love  
To know what I'm feeling  
Each time you say goodbye  
I find a reason why to give us one more try  
Knowing, knowing, baby  
You're gonna hurt me! Ooh, ooh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, do it to me one more time  
Give you one more chance this heart of mine  
Do it to me one more time  
Can't get enough of your love!

There ain't nothing I can hide, baby  
I just love the way you love me  
Do it to me one more time, oh baby  
Can't you see girl, that I need you  
All I wanna do is please you  
Even though it's hard to love you  
Do it to me one more time, oh yeah  
When you move girl, you tease me  
We make love slow and easy  
I just want you here beside me  
Do it to me one more time!  
Do it, do it baby

Green-eyed Boy
Dolly Parton
----------------
(Dolly Parton)  
I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
'Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a green-eyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame, respect, and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars, so I chose those  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss  
That green-eyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my green-eyed boy

The Best Day
Taylor Swift
----------------
I'm five years old  
It's getting cold  
I've got my big coat on  
  
I hear your laugh  
And look up smiling at you  
I run and run  
Past the pumpkin patch  
And the tractor rides  
Look now, the sky is gold  
I hug your legs  
And fall asleep on the way home  
  
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall  
But I know you're not scared of anything at all  
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I'm thirteen now  
And don't know how  
My friends could be so mean  
I come home crying  
And you hold me tight  
And grab the keys  
  
And we drive and drive  
Until we found a town far enough away  
And we talk and window shop  
'Till I forgotten all their names  
  
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school  
But I know I'm laughing  
On the car ride home with you  
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay  
But I know I had the best day with you today  
  
I have an excellent father  
His strength is making me stronger  
God smiles on my little brother  
Inside and out he's better than I am  
I grew up in a pretty house  
And I've got space to run and hide  
And I had the best days with you  
  
There is a video I found  
From back when I was three  
You set up a paint set in the kitchen  
And you're talking to me  
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships  
And the seven dwarfs  
And Daddy's smart  
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world  
  
And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall  
I know you were on my side  
Even when I was wrong  
And I love you for giving me your eyes  
Staying back and watching me shine  
  
And, I didn't know if you knew  
So I'm taking this chance to say  
That I had the best day with you today.

So they ask me  
Young boy  
What you gonna do the second time around  
How you goin' come back

Of the deads forehead I killed the father  
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater  
I will put them body on chill like glaciers  
Gracias I'm crazy yes it's obvious  
Going against me is atheist  
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust  
I ain't sniffin' I'm just pitchin' ya honor I ain't snitchin' ya honor  
Hate bitch niggas bitches with power  
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter  
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard  
Put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles  
I remember being young tryin' to hustle my dough  
Tryin' to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap  
Tryin' to tell you fool you chump that my mack ain't broke  
You ain't tryin' to see how far that black back lane go  
No, call me Pacman you ghosts is blue  
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue  
Jewelry, usually I'm a hooligan for the money  
Yeah I'm eatin' but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh  
Make harm in the bomb you in public  
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothin'  
Look it's mornin' no yawnin' or nothin'

You gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts  
Then shake a nigga shorts and we takin' what we want  
I'm so 5-0-4 you got to kill me here  
If you ever lookin' for me bitch I will be here  
Cash Money is an army Navy Seal me here  
Lot of niggas ran from it but I'll still be here  
No chrome on the continental I'm so fundamental  
Crack the phill' crack the roof and roll up the window  
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home  
That's why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song  
You leapin' at a dog a dog wit no bark  
Just a bite like an old shark  
And all you bitch niggas no paw

Sunshine's on the king and sets on the prince  
I met the Birdman and I been shinin' ever since like that (that, that, that)

So cool, what a cool time  
It's so cool, what a cool time  
That's what you're having, I'm having one too  
  
It's a cool cool time, running up the river  
It's a cool cool time, for running down the stream  
It's a cool cool time, for cutting up the profits  
It's a cool cool time, for a cool cool dream  
  
Some say the world is full of fools  
Other people agree  
Some say the world is full of fools  
Fools will always agree  
  
Such a cool cool time, running up the river  
It's a cool cool time, to be running down to the sea  
A cool cool time, running up the river  
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream  
  
That's what you're having  
It's a cool cool dream  
  
It's a cool time, out in Arabia  
It's a cool time, when all the boys come home  
It's a cool cool time, out in South America  
A cool cool time, when all the money rolls in  
  
Cool time for running up the harbor  
It's a cool cool time, for running to the sea  
It's a cool cool time, running down the river  
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream  
  
Meddling fools, give them a medal  
Don't let them meddle with me  
Meddling fools, meddling fools  
Don't you meddle with me, I don't like them  
  
It's a cool cool time, way out there in Africa  
It's a cool cool time, such a cultural edge  
A cool cool time, out with the brothers there  
A cool cool time, driving in the wedge  
  
Give them a medal  
Give them another precious medal and put a price on it  
Give that boy a medal  
Ask him to put a price on it, precious medal  
  
It's a cool time, out in Arabia  
This cool time  
It's a cool cool time, out in the Gulf of Arabia  
It's a cool cool time, when all your sons come home?  
  
It's such a cool time, turn your television on  
It's a cool time, it's a cool time, it's just a cool cool time  
Such a cool cool time, such a cool cool time  
It's just a cool cool time, just a cool cool time  
  
It's a chilling time, quite cool for killing  
Just a killing time, such a cool killing time

You Ain't Goin' Nowhere
Counting Crows

Clouds so swift  
Rain won't lift  
Gate won't close  
Railings froze  
Get your mind off wintertime  
You ain't going nowhere  
Oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
Oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
I don't care  
How many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
Pick up your money  
And pack up your tent  
You ain't going nowhere  
Oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Buy me a flute  
And a gun that shoots  
Tailgates and substitutes  
Strap yourself  
To a tree with roots  
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere  
I said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Genghis Khan  
He could not keep  
All his kings  
Supplied with sleep  
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep  
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it  
And Everybody says  
Whoo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
Oh, no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
I said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down into the easy chair!

You're An Ocean
Fastball
----------------
Can you make it easier for me to understand,  
How you're holding my heart, in your trembling hands...  
Eyes that rise to meet me half way up among the stars,  
You may be from Venus but I'm definitely not from Mars  
  
[Chorus]  
You're An Ocean, You're An Ocean  
Settle Down, Settle Down,  
What's the commotion,  
I'm an island, but you're an ocean,  
It's a stormy sea of love and emotion,  
You've got me suspended motionless in time  
  
Make the warm winds circle round my head just like you do,  
If I could do it, I'd be doing it to you,  
I believe I'd buy whatever you would sell to me,  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe I'd buy whatever you would sell to me,  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee,  
  
You're An Ocean, You're An Ocean  
Settle Down, Settle Down,  
What's the commotion,  
I'm an island, but you're an ocean,  
It's a stormy sea of love and emotion,  
You've got me suspended motionless in time

I Can't Stand The Rain
Tina Turner
----------------
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
  
Hey window pain  
Tell me, do you remember  
How sweet it used to be  
  
When we were together  
Everything was so grand  
Now that we've parted  
There's just one sound  
That I just can't stand  
  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
  
Hey hey rain  
Get out of my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories

Save The Life Of My Child
Paul Simon
----------------
"Good God! Don't jump!"  
A boy sat on the ledge.  
An old man who had fainted was revived.  
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed  
If the boy survived.  
  
"Save the life of my child!"  
Cried the desperate mother.  
  
The woman from the supermarket  
Ran to call the cops.  
"He must be high on something," someone said.  
Though it never made The New York Times.  
In The Daily News, the caption read,  
"Save the life of my child!"  
Cried the desperate mother.  
  
A patrol car passing by  
Halted to a stop.  
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:  
"The force can't do a decent job  
'Cause the kids got no respect  
For the law today (and blah blah blah)."  
  
"Save the life of my child!"  
Cried the desperate mother.  
"What's becoming of the children?"  
People asking each other.  
  
When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd  
And made them wild  
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday.  
When the spotlight hit the boy,  
The crowd began to cheer,  
He flew away.  
  
"Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place."

Anyone Can Tell
Crowded House
----------------
I dream of a place that's hedged with roses  
With a man in the middle don't talk in riddles  
You get hung on every single word  
Some call it high, some call it low  
  
And I hear about things you don't want to know  
But the truth is still a valuable thing  
Don't get caught with your pants down baby  
This world the criminal sing  
  
There is another world waiting  
But anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell that I'm not lying  
  
You can hide your face  
Pull it into shades  
'Cause you can't escape the lie forever  
I dream of a place that's overrun by children  
  
And the lord is in the kitchen  
Do your work and you'll get your rewards  
'Cause what you are is all that really matters  
What is left you can easily scatter  
  
On the ground a head covered in mud  
Don't step on my principles baby  
In spite of what you have done  
One day you will have the wisdom  
  
I will tell you  
Everything straight  
Anyone can tell that I'm not lying  
You can hide your face  
  
You can change your shape  
'Cause you can escape the lie forever  
Anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell

I Come Undone
Christina Aguilera
----------------
Ohh, ooh, ooh oh yeah  
  
Used to be calm  
Used to be cool  
But something about you  
Changed all the rules  
I kept to myself  
I guarded my heart  
But that all fell apart  
  
Now just like a fool  
I've fallen in love with you, oh  
I got these crazy feelings  
All over you, oh  
  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Every time I'm close to you  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Can't help myself from falling in love  
  
Kiss me again  
Ooh, there I go  
You got my heart racing  
Out of control  
Got butterflies  
And I can't disguise  
That I'm feeling so much  
  
You intoxicate  
You fascinate  
You know you make me crazy  
What can I say, oh yeah  
  
I come undone (alright)  
I come undone  
Every time I'm close to you, ooh  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Can't help myself from falling in love, oh  
  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Anytime you walk in the room, ohh  
I come undone  
I come undone  
I can't help, I can't stop  
I can't shake this crazy love  
  
Do ya, do ya, do ya know  
What you to do me  
Do ya, do ya  
What you do to me  
  
Something behind your smile  
Something inside your eyes  
Makes me feel (makes me feel)  
Love... Ohh...  
  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Ooh, every time I'm close to you, oh  
I come undone (oh no, ohh)  
I come undone  
Can't help myself from falling in love, oh oh  
  
I come undone (when you walk in the room)  
I come undone (I come undone)  
Any time you walk in the room, oh baby, baby now  
I come undone (ooh yeah, yeah)  
I come undone  
I can't help, I can't stop  
Can't shake this crazy thing  
  
I come undone (oh oh, oh oh, ohh)  
(Baby now, baby now, baby baby now)  
I come undone  
Every time I'm close to you, ohh  
I come undone (alright)  
I come undone (can't help myself, can't help myself)  
I'm coming undone, when you're in the room

Nah fuck it, turn it off

Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it, your saviour's my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

Up jump tha boogie then bang, let 'em hang  
While tha paraniod try ta stuff tha void  
Let's capture this AM mayhem  
Undressed, and blessed by tha Lord  
Tha power pendulum swings by tha umbilical cord  
Shock around tha clock, from noon 'til noon  
Men grabbin' they mics, and stuff 'em into tha womb  
Terror's tha product ya push  
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I gotta headrush  
Sheep tremble an here come tha votes  
Thrown from tha throat, new cages an scapegoats  
Undressed and blessed by tha Lord  
Tha same devil that ran around Managua wit a sword  
Check out tha new style that Ollie found  
I tune in wit a bullet ta shut down tha devil sound  
Shut down tha devil sound

Shut down tha devil sound  
  
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it turn it off

Somebody gotta shell 'em  
These evil angels lists, hittin' tha AM playlist  
Paid ta say this  
That one inhuman, illegal, single woman  
Tha one wit out a room  
The transmissions wippin' our backs  
Yeah, comin' down like bats from Stacy Coon  
Terror's tha product ya push  
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I gotta headrush  
Tha sheep tremble an here come tha votes  
Thrown from tha throat, new cages and scapegoats

After years of waiting nothing came  
As your life flashed before your eyes  
You realize  
  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off, get off, get off my case (x2)  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case  
Get off my case  
  
After years of waiting  
After years of waiting nothing came  
And you realize you're looking,  
Looking in the wrong place  
  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case (x2)  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case (x2)  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case (x3)  
  
After years of waiting

Minutes To Memories
John Mellencamp
----------------
On a Greyhound thirty miles beyond Jamestown  
He saw the sun set on the Tennessee line  
He looked at the young man who was riding beside him  
He said I'm old kind of worn out inside  
I worked my whole life in the steel mills of Gary  
And my father before me I helped build this land  
Now I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness  
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands  
My family and friends are the best thing I've known  
Through the eye of the needle I'll carry them home  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The rain hit the old dog in the twilight's last gleaming  
He said "son it sounds like rattling old bones"  
This highway is long but I know some that are longer  
By sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home  
Through the hills of Kentucky 'cross the Ohio river  
The old man kept talking 'bout his life and his times  
He fell asleep with his head against the window  
He said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind  
This world offers riches and riches will grow wings  
I don't take stock in those uncertain things  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow  
I do things my way and I pay a high price  
When I think back on the old man and the bus ride  
Now that I'm older I can see he was right  
  
Another hot one out on highway eleven  
This is my life It's what I've chosen to do  
There are no free rides, no one said it'd be easy  
The old man told me this my son I'm telling it to you  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can

Small Hours
Pogues
----------------
I close the door and turn the key  
And dream a world for you and me  
Beyond the walls, a city breathes  
In this room one heart beats  
The stars, they shine for you and me  
On the street, ten floors below  
The city lights are all aglow  
The corner girls, they come and go  
Dreaming of a ticket home  
The stars, they shine for you and me  
I'll have a drink and then we'll see  
If the spirit conjures your genie  
To lie beside me in my dreams  
The wind is blowing a melody  
The stars, they shine for you and me  
Close the door and turn the key  
And now that you're alone with me  
We'll sit up late and watch TV  
The neon flashes red and green  
Oh, the stars, they shine for you and me

How's Chances?
Irving Berlin
----------------
When I want to see the boys  
I know where to find the boys  
I don't go through a club or two  
I just find you and there are the boys  
To get you alone I strive  
You ask me to tea at five  
I find you then with other men  
And wonder when my chance will arrive  
  
How's chances, say, how are the chances  
Of making you love me the way I love you  
  
How many young men must I fight with  
To be in right with  
In right with you  
  
How's chances for one of those glances  
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see  
  
How's chances to end all your romances  
And start taking your chances with me  
  
  
[alternate bridge:]  
My castle will need some restoring  
Ceiling and flooring  
Furniture, too

Hate
Z-Ro
----------------
[Z-Ro]  
Hey, why they hate me like I stole something  
To make a nigga want to roll something  
But I'm they closest partner, if I let them hold something  
Good for nothing, but making me hate my peers  
So let the world taste my tears  
When they roll, they represent anger, paranoid with one in the chamber  
To live the heads shots to my foes, and make them through with Dana  
And when they splash it's a blood bath, and I trust no one  
Ain't no more chunking up the deuce, when my thugs pass  
Live my life in silentary vomet away from y'all  
If I needed artillery could I even get the K from y'all  
I'm all alone in the ways of the wicked, since I can't stand you hoes  
Forever lonely when I kick it, in the lumino  
With straps and shells, my life is murder and mail  
The opposition see me coming, and they blast they self  
This for my homies that don't know me, when I'm broke  
Swear to God I hope you motherfuckers choke, when my gun smoke, hate  
[Chorus - 2x]  
The H is for these hoe niggas that's all in my face  
And the A is for the actions that these bitch niggas take  
And the T is for the tommy gun that's bout to blast  
And the E is for eternal cause I ever last  
[Z-Ro]  
I be feeling like Pac, because I wonder if they still down  
Facing homicide from haters, but my homies didn't even spill rounds  
Fuck y'all, I hate you motherfuckers to death  
Remember times, when I stopped niggas from clutching your chest  
I live in bulletproof vests, but it seems  
The only time I got family, is when a nigga dream  
So fuck sleep, I'm on a 24 hour grind  
Look at your darling son, now mama I'm out of my mind  
I don't know how to be happy and I can't smile, and fuck a bitch  
Cause she be plotting on how to get you, when y'all walking down the isle  
The same motherfuckers that you care for, look how they do you  
They don't love you pick up your pistol, and therefor  
Represent yourself with the plastic, cause me myself  
Want to put all of you motherfuckers in caskets  
Fuck love, unless it's coming from the heaven up above  
My hatred being written in blood, hate  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
There ain't no telling if a nigga make it, I might be stuck in the slums  
A walking target steady ducking the gun  
But even me and you can keep your wife, there'll be no hostages  
Just give me what I'm looking for, and keep your life  
I'm military minded, you can ask Klondike Kat  
Even if they bomb first, Z-Ro is bout to bomb right back  
I give a fuck about your life now, slugs hitting your windpipe now  
Guess you could say I'm living shife now  
All about my fetty, till I bubble like some champagne  
Z-Ro the Crooked, the most valuable player up in this rap game  
So back back, back back, be sure to give me more than fifty  
Automatic rounds, down to pass that  
Murder my foes, then I murder my friends  
Because they turned on a nigga, when I ain't have no ends, hate  
Murder my foes, then I murder my friends  
Because they turned on a nigga, when a nigga wasn't chopping a Benz, hate  
[Chorus - 4x]

Never Gonna Say Good Bye
Europe
----------------
Another day you didn't go to school,  
You were in my arms breakin all the rules  
Another night without you by my side,  
This ain't the way to spend our lives  
Sometimes I wanna leave this town  
Find a better place where they won't put us down  
I know time is on our side, so I'm hangin on somehow  
Never gonna give you up  
Never gonna say goodbye  
As long as were together baby we'll survive  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna turn away  
Cause I don't wanna lose you  
Never gonna give you up  
People talk about us on the street  
Rumors fly everytime we meet  
But we don't never have to be ashamed  
Our love is real it ain't no game  
You say that we should hide away  
I promise baby we don't have to be afraid  
I know time is on our side, we've just gotta hang on somehow

Long Distance Love Affair
Cher
----------------
Long distance love affair  
Writer klaus meine  
  
The only king of rock has gone  
Gone to heaven  
A star on the way to the stars  
Another king of rock is born in '77  
Just born to be there when it's dark  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time  
Just to get the message to be more  
Than you desire  
A star full of life wild and young  
The hits from 1994 electric fire  
Will burn out the time like the sun  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time

Five Years
David Bowie
----------------
Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing  
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in  
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying  
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying  
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies  
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s  
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there  
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people  
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
  
A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children  
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them  
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer  
Threw up at the sight of that  
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor, drinking milk shakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think  
You knew you were in this song  
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor  
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there  
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk  
  
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes  
We've got five years, what a surprise  
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot  
We've got five years, that's all we've got

And if that mockingbird don't sing,  
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.  
  
And if that diamond ring turn brass,  
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.  
  
And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat.  
  
And if that billy goat don't pull,  
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.  
  
And if that cart and bull turn over,  
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.  
  
And if that dog named Rover won't bark.  
Papa's gonna to buy you and horse and cart.  
  
And if that horse and cart fall down,  
Well you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.

For Veronica's Sake
Alice Cooper
----------------
I got a name and number  
I got a bed assigned  
I got a dog in the city pound  
that I left behind  
I'm strapped down and wild eyed  
she's locked up in a pen  
she needs somebody to feed her  
and i'm her only friend  
so for Veronica's sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronica's sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here  
We both been put in cages  
we got our shots and tags  
I got my sweating fist to shake  
she's got her tail to wag  
she has to bark and whimper  
while I can scream and shout  
the clock above the psycho ward  
says time is running out  
so for Veronica's sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronica's sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here  
And I can hear her howling all night  
at the lonely moon  
They're gonna give her the gas  
if I don't get there soon  
I gotta get there soon  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here  
for Veronica's sake she can get pretty weird  
for Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here.

Coffee Shop
Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
I am just a lousy bum  
Searching for the unknown crumb  
The crumb the crumb  
Something or someone to come  
  
Come along illuminate my lust  
Combust  
Confucius might have been confused  
And Buddha might have blown a fuse  
I ooze the muse  
  
Meet me at the coffee shop  
We can dance like Iggy Pop  
Another go in the parking lot  
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot  
  
Back and forth my body's jerking  
Will to thrill will not stop working  
Work and work  
I'll take you on a honeymoon  
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room  
The room the groom  
  
Meet me at the coffee shop  
We can dance  
Like Iggy Pop  
Another go in the parking lot  
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

Take It To The Streets
Matt Redman
----------------
I am not a stranger to mercy, for You found me  
Wrapped Your truth around me  
I am not a stranger to grace  
I have seen it in Your face  
I am not a stranger to kindness  
We're the broken with Your life inside us  
You have brought Your gospel to me  
And I breathe it every day  
How did I become Your miracle?  
Now to take Your truth and tell the world  
I'm going to take it to the streets  
I'm going to sing it 'til we meet  
Heaven is open  
Come on all the earth rejoice  
I'm going to take it to the streets  
Wake up the dead heart from its sleep  
Heaven is open  
Now's the time to raise our voice  
I will tell the world of this mercy, for You found me  
Wrapped Your truth around me  
I will tell the world of this grace  
I have seen it at Your cross  
I will tell the world of this kindness  
We're the broken with Your life inside us  
You have brought Your gospel to me  
Help me live it every day  
How did we become Your miracles?  
Now to take Your truth and tell the world

9 To 5
Alison Krauss
----------------
I tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen  
Pour myself a cup of ambition  
And yawn and stretch ,trying to come to life  
I jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping  
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumping  
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5  
  
[Chorus]  
Workin 9 to 5,what a way to make a livin  
Barley gettin by, it's all takin and no givin  
They just use your mind and they never give you credit  
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it  
  
they let you dream just to watch'em shatter  
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder  
But you've got dreams he'll never take away  
You're in the same boat with a lot of your friends  
Waiting for the day your ship'll come in  
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away  
  
[Chorus]

Drinking Champagne
George Strait
----------------
I'm drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
I'll keep having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

Proof
Coldplay
----------------
So I waited for you  
What wouldn't I do?  
And I'm covered it's true  
I'm covered in you  
  
If I ever want proof  
I find it in you  
Yeah I honestly do  
In you I find proof  
  
Light, dark  
Bright spark  
Light, dark, and then light  
  
So I waited all day  
What wouldn't I say  
And all the thing in you way  
Things happen that way  
  
And if I ever want proof  
Then I find it in you  
Yeah I honestly do  
In you I find proof  
  
Light, dark  
Bright spark  
Light, dark, and then light  
  
Light, light, light... light...

Eminem Part 1
Eminem
----------------
Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg  
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty  
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D  
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas  
Cross the bombest  
We blowing up your house  
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas  
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus  
Cause I ain't making no more threats  
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes  
On Vietnam war vets  
I am more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more  
Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,  
And the day before Sabateur  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Cross My Heart And Hope To Die
Elvis Presley
----------------
I can't explain about last night  
Though things didn't look just right  
Please believe me there was nothing wrong  
I thought about you baby all night long  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie, mmm  
  
Talk about a piece of rotten luck  
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck  
She couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree  
Very hard to handle like a Model T  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie  
  
Please believe me when I say  
Wild horses couldn't drag me away  
From you 'cause I don't have to look too hard  
To see what I've got in my own back yard  
So be forgiving and forget  
Don't say my alibi's all wet (?)  
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb  
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie  
  
I wouldn't tell you no lie  
No no no no no no  
I wouldn't tell you no lie

Let It Ride
Gordon Lightfoot
----------------
These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you  
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true  
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun  
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find  
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind  
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind  
I just let it ride  
I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night  
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight  
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground  
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found  
He just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots  
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops  
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot  
They just let it ride  
One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by  
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried  
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light  
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night  
They just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal  
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all  
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon  
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride

Little Honda
Yo La Tengo
----------------
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you  
We're going down to the auto shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do  
Get on the ride, no sweat, sure we'll take you anywhere you want me to  
  
First gear, it's all right  
Second gear, hang on tight  
Third gear, ain't I right  
Faster, it's all right  
  
It's not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike  
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, that two-wheel ride  
We'll go on into the hills or anywhere you wanna decide  
  
We'll ride some hills like a champ because my Honda's built really light  
When I go into the turn, lean with me, hang on tight  
I think I'll put on the lights, so I can ride mine under the night

I Love You
Faith Hill
----------------
I must be crazy now  
Maybe I dream too much  
But when I think of you  
I long to feel your touch  
To whisper in your ear  
Words that are old as time  
Words only you would hear  
If only you were mine  
  
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you  
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes  
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do  
And you'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side  
  
te amo
Please say you love me too  
These three words  
They could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
Until the end of time  
  
So today I finally find the courage deep inside  
Just to walk right up to your door  
But my body can't move when I finally get to it  
Like a thousand times before  
Then without a word you handed me this letter  
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said  
  
te amo
Please say you love me too  
Until the end of time  
  
Well maybe I, I need a little love, yeah  
Maybe I, I need a little care  
Maybe you, maybe you need somebody just to hold you  
If you do, Just reach out, I'll be there  
  
te amo
Please say you love me  
Please say you love me too  
These three words, they could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
  
Oh, I love you  
Please say you love me  
Please say you love me too  
Until the end of time  
Oh baby, my baby, together, forever  
te amo
I will be your light  
Shining through your eyes

Ocean Avenue
Yellowcard
----------------
There's a place off Ocean Avenue  
Where I used to sit and talk with you  
We were both 16 and it felt so right  
Sleeping all day, staying up all night  
Staying up all night  
  
There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  
We would walk on the beach in our barefeet  
We were both 18 and it felt so right  
Sleeping all day, staying up all night  
Staying up all night  
  
If I could find you now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah yeah  
  
There's a piece of you that's here with me  
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see  
When I sleep I dream and it gets me by  
I can make believe that you're here tonight  
That your here tonight  
  
If I could you find now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah  
  
I remember the look in your eyes  
When I told you that this was goodbye  
You were begging me not tonight  
Not here, not now  
We're looking up at the same night sky  
We keep pretending the sun will not rise  
We'll be together for one more night  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
If I could find you now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah yeah

All I Do
Hillsong United
----------------
I wanted to find  
Where I was going  
Everything I tried  
It took me nowhere  
I was so tired of just living my life  
Waiting for a sign  
You came to my side  
Gave me direction  
Strong on the inside  
I shine for You Lord  
Now it's my time  
Now I've made up my mind  
To be all You want for me  
All I do  
Is live my life for You  
I know it's true  
I'll never let You go  
All I do  
I'd anything for You  
Everything is in Your Hands  
So I get up  
Get up and praise You  
And I know where I'm going  
I know where I'm going

Everything Has Changed
Ed Sheeran
----------------
[Taylor Swift]  
I use to think that love was for dreamers,  
"Love at first sight" I never believed it,  
Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,  
But that was until I met you.  
Now everything is changed.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away,  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away,  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray.  
And that's when I met you.  
And now everything is changed.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Oh darling,  
You look like your soul is lost.  
What could've happened to make you feel so low?  
Don't let the liquor ease your hurt.  
Don't let your heart go cold.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Oh darling,  
Don't worry, I'll be just fine.  
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?  
If I weren't drinking then I'd be crying,  
And I think that's something we both rather miss.  
  
[Both]  
But I guess that's just how the cookie crumbles,  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you can't feel anymore.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
That's the thing about love,  
That's the reason why I'll never fall again,  
It hurts when it's supposed to make you make you feel good.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Well if that's what love is,  
Then I don't ever wanna try it out,  
But something tells me I should.  
  
Even though we've only met each other,  
We'll work it out together until everything is changed.  
Until everything is good.

Like A Baby
George Michael
----------------
Foreign skies  
That blinded me to empty charms  
I crossed the ocean and fell into your arms  
So sure, so wrong  
You sang me a simple tune  
I took it for a song  
  
Say goodbye, don't tell me why you have to go  
Loving you was as good as gold (as good as gold)  
I'd love to love you, really love you  
But you see, there's something you should now  
I really didn't think you'd go  
  
Because today  
I could have sworn I heard you say  
te amo
I want you  
I need to be with you  
  
Today  
I saw something in your face  
Stay here  
Beside me  
I need your love to hide me  
You lied  
And now you've gone away  
And left me crying like a baby

Lightning In The Sky
Santana
----------------
Lightning in the sky  
Thunder on the ground  
Man and beast alike  
Seeking shelter from the storm  
All around there is fear in the air  
All around there is fear in the air  
  
Burning drops of rain  
Flood my thirsty soul  
Cold chills to the bone  
Glowing eyes filled with pain  
All around there's a cry no one hears  
All around there's a cry no one hears  
  
Always on the run  
Never taking time to see  
Beauty all around  
Nature's dance is just for me  
All around, Nature's dance  
Sólo para mí
All around, Nature's dance  
Sólo para mí
  
Rainbows glowing high  
Evening shadows fall  
Don't you wait for me  
I won't be back for your call  
  
I am free from your spell, I am free  
I am free from your spell, I am free  
I am free from your spell, I am free  
Free, free, free  
Free from your spell, I am free

Hard To Thrill
Eric Clapton
----------------
Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
There is nothin' you can show me  
That I haven't seen before  
I got the time to kill, keepin' to myself inside this room  
Time to kill, keepin' to myself inside this room  
Over forty years of Fridays  
And you give up tryin' too  
Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
I'm hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore  
There ain't nothin' you can show me  
That I haven't seen before  
Hard to thrill, but nothin' really moves me anymore  
Hard to thrill, but nothin' really moves me anymore

Tiny Broken Heart
Alison Krauss
----------------
He was just a little farm lad, so busy at play  
With his little playmate outside the gate  
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door  
At the home of his tiny playmate  
Then he saw his daddy watching too  
As the men swiftly walked to the cottage door  
He knew they were strangers that came from the town  
Men he had never seen before  
They soon went to work when he heard his daddy say  
?Our neighbors are moving today?  
?Oh no!? he cried, ?Dear God don't let it be  
They can't take my sweetheart away?  
I know dad, you don't understand  
How a heart so young could conceive a plan  
I'm only seven now but it's just like you say  
Daddy, someday I'll be a man  
The man who owns the farm where your playmates do live  
He told me it'd have to be this way  
For winter time has come and the work is all done  
That's why they are moving today  
Let us buy the farm so they can stay  
And give them all the toys that dear Santa gave  
And give them all my pennies in my little piggy bank  
Pennies that my darlin' help me save

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Pretenders

Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on  
Our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
From now on  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together  
If the Fates allow  
Hang a shining star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now

Like I Am
Rascal Flatts
----------------
Lying here with you  
I watch you while you sleep  
The dawn is closing in  
With every breath you breathe  
  
I can feel the change  
The change you've made in me  
But will I ever see  
All the things you see in me  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When it comes to love  
I may not know the rules  
But there's one thing I know  
My heart belongs to you, just you  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
You show me you love me  
With a fire that burns deep inside  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am

I don't think I'll ever understand  
Why you love me  
Why you love me just like I am

Constant through another year  
Hear our song of thankfulness  
Father and Redeemer hear  
  
Dark the future

Something I Can Feel
Leann Rimes
----------------
Cross my heart and I swear the truth  
Love was dead to me til' i met you  
I spent, a lot of time building up these walls  
Then you come strutting in with your wrecking ball  
  
Just another girl defeated  
Til' you gimme what I needed  
  
Something I can feel  
Something I can feel deep down (Yeah)  
What did I do to deserve  
Someone who gives me love  
That gets better and better and better  
  
Sometimes I've gotta bite my tongue  
It even freaks me out the way I talk you up  
Your like a bad flip on the trampoline  
You just say my name I'm dizzy on my feet  
  
When my day goes numb and empty  
You know exactly how to give me  
  
Something I can feel  
Something I can feel deep down (Yeah)  
You know you're striking in love  
That keeps making this better and better and better  
Something I can feel  
  
I never ever need to ask for more (No)  
What did I do to deserve  
Someone who gives me love  
That gets better and better and better  
  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love  
  
Something I can feel  
Something I can feel deep down (Yeah)  
You know you're striking in love  
That keeps making this better and better and better  
Something I can feel  
I never ever need to ask for more (No)  
What did I do to deserve  
Someone who gives me love  
That gets better and better and better  
  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love (Something I can feel)  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love (Something I can feel)  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love

At The Cross
Hillsong
----------------
Verse 1:  
Oh Lord You've searched me  
You know my way  
Even when I fail You  
I know You love me  
  
Verse 2:  
Your holy presence  
Surrounded me  
In every season  
I know You love me  
I know You love me  
  
At the cross I bow my knees  
Where Your blood was she'd for me  
There's no greater love than this  
  
You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest place  
What can separate me now  
  
Verse 3:  
You go before me  
You shield my way  
Your hand upholds me  
And I know You love me  
  
At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was she'd for me  
There's no greater love than this  
  
You have overcome the grave  
Your glory fills the highest praise  
What can separate me now  
  
At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was she'd for me  
There's no greater love than this, no  
  
You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest praise  
What can separate me now  
  
Verse 4:  
And when the earth fails  
Falls from my eyes  
And You stand before me  
I know You love me  
Oh, I know You love me  
  
At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was she'd for me  
There's no greater love than this, no  
  
You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest praise  
What can separate me now  
  
At the cross I bow my knee  
Where Your blood was she'd for me  
There's no greater love than this, no  
  
You have overcome the grave  
Glory fills the highest praise  
What can separate me now  
  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done

In My Secret Life
Leonard Cohen
----------------
I saw you this morning.  
You were moving so fast.  
Can't seem to loosen my grip  
On the past.  
And I miss you so much.  
There's no one in sight.  
And we're still making love  
In My Secret Life.  
  
I smile when I'm angry.  
I cheat and I lie.  
I do what I have to do  
To get by.  
But I know what is wrong,  
And I know what is right.  
And I'd die for the truth  
In My Secret Life.  
  
Hold on, hold on, my brother.  
My sister, hold on tight.  
I finally got my orders.  
I'll be marching through the morning,  
Marching through the night,  
Moving cross the borders  
Of My Secret Life.  
  
Looked through the paper.  
Makes you want to cry.  
Nobody cares if the people  
Live or die.  
And the dealer wants you thinking  
That it's either black or white.  
Thank G-d it's not that simple  
In My Secret Life.  
  
I bite my lip.  
I buy what I'm told:  
From the latest hit,  
To the wisdom of old.  
But I'm always alone.  
And my heart is like ice.  
And it's crowded and cold  
In My Secret Life.

Nowhere To Run (Vapor Trail)
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
Fuck that shit, you know what I'm sayin'?  
I'm a give a shout out to my niggas  
I ain't givin' a shout to no-fuckin'-body, fuck that  
Big Baby Jesus in the mother fucking house  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
  
Unh, come on  
I don't walk, I stalk, livin' foul like pork  
Shuttin' down underground streets of New York  
Hawk is what them niggas call me, 'cause they all be  
Suckin' my dick and on my mother fucking balls, G  
I know the half, so I laugh wit' 'em  
Blood bath went I let the fuckin' rap hit 'em  
Full clip, but only half did 'em  
That's all it took, another crook  
Taken out over a dirty look  
I bag game with niggas I leave shot dead  
You're only taken a piss from me with hot led  
You know my style faggot, 'cause I'm always schemin'  
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'  
Police, but you got no peace  
Yo, was that you big man, and alot mo' grease  
All I gets is pounds, you ain't want none of this  
Back streets are like track meets 'cause I be runnin' this  
  
Ain't nowhere to run ('cause I be runnin' this)  
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)  
Ain't nowhere to go ('cause I be runnin' this)  
Reaper saved your soul (come on)  
  
Surroned by the colors, I see crimson, black and blue (come on)  
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you  
(straight up, mother fucker)  
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew (come on)  
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do? (straight up)  
Center of the universe, collecting me in time (come on)  
I'm falling down upon the earth, and singing truth in rhyme (come on)  
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm through (come on)  
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you  
(Dirt Dog in effect)  
  
Ain't nowhere to run ('cause I be runnin' this)  
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)  
Ain't nowhere to go ('cause I be runnin' this)  
Reaper saved your soul (come on)

Reaper saved your soul (come on)

What you mother fuckers invented  
Is the craziest nigga that ever been invented

Most know, don't front on Ol' Dity Bastard  
ha ha ha ha  
I call on Jesus  
There's no obstacles that you have to jump  
There's no walls that you have to climb  
This is real, this is elementary dear  
Elementary, Watson, Elementary  
ahhhhh  
I ain't no pictue on your fore wall, necklace wearin' beard  
You don't want this money till it's rich  
Buy my album, coded by Dirty, set you free  
Go against the grain, I got the p  
I know you don't recognize me now  
I dunked your tongue  
How many lightening bulbs do it take to light up a fuck mode?  
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me  
We don't need it, it gets more ugly  
Fools tryin' to bust their ass  
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name  
I call myself in the niggas butthole  
All the same, all the same, all the same  
  
Ain't nowhere to run  
Ain't nowhere to hide  
Ain't nowhere to go  
Reaper saved your soul  
  
ahhh yi yi yi yi  
What, mother fucker?  
Don't try to psychology my shit, mother fucker  
'cause you'll never psychology it, mother fucker  
Never, never, never, mother fucker, never

North Atlantic Drift
Ocean Colour Scene
----------------
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
It's a cultural shift, it's the North Atlantic drift  
Americana and a rule Britannia  
And the moon, yes, we own that too  
And where the Euphrates meets the other river  
Is now the home of the devil and the liar  
And the pyre we plan to make is just the drift leaving its wake, ah  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
And the films you want to watch and the films you want to make  
And the kids, like lost angels dressed in black sensations  
And the shift won't shake and the drift won't brake  
With billions of diamonds growing like olives and the drift holds the coffers  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns

Until The Night
Billy Joel
----------------
I never ask you where you go  
After I leave you in the morning  
We go our different ways to separate situations  
It's not that easy anymore  
Today I do what must be done  
I give my time to total strangers  
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever  
MOre than it ever did before  
CHORUS  
Until the night, until the night  
I just might make it  
Until the night, until the night  
When I see you again  
Now you're afraid that we have changed  
And I'm afraid we're getting older  
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces  
So many lovers come and gone  
I'll have my fears like every man  
You'll have your tears like every woman  
Today we'll be unsure, is this what we believe in  
And wonder how can we go on  
CHORUS  
When the sun goes down  
And the day is over  
When the last of the light has gone  
As they pour into the street  
I will be getting closer  
As the cars turn their headlights on  
While they're closing it down  
We're gonna open it up  
And while they're going to sleep  
We'll just be starting to touch  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to give  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to live  
Before I leave you again  
Before the light of the dawn  
Before this evening can end  
I have been waiting so long  
CHORUS

Too Close
Ariana Grande
----------------
You know what I want, I know what you don't  
I should be the one you love uh  
Boy you got my mind, playing truth or dare  
Daring me kiss you right here  
  
Though we've been friends so long, and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see, you're perfect for me  
But I just can't let it show  
  
I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
  
  
Remember that girl, that you used to date  
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great  
So what would you do? What would you say?  
If I said I loved you [?]  
  
Though we've been friends so long, and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see, you're perfect for me  
But I just can't let it show  
  
I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
Make noise  
  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
Make noise  
  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
Make noise  
  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
All my ladies  
Make noise  
  
But I just can't let it show  
  
I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close

Down if we get too close

Let's Do It Again
Perry Como
----------------
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop until I say when  
'Cause your kisses are sweet  
An' I don't want the feelin' to end!  
  
We glide on a magic carpet ride  
All around us stars collide  
And there's poetry inside my head  
It seems I can hear some haunting theme  
Yet there's something in your scheme  
That's too real to be a dream instead!  
  
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop until I say when  
'Cause your kisses are sweet  
An' I don't want the feelin' to end!  
  
The sound all around begins to pound  
An' I know we're homeward bound  
To a world we've often found before  
We climb into space an' out of time  
Then the bells begin to chime  
We're in rhythm and in rhyme, once more!  
  
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop until I say when  
'Cause your kisses are sweet  
An' I don't want the feelin' to end!  
  
Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,  
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back  
Then... we'll do it again an' again!  
  
Don't stop...

Breathe Reprise
Pink Floyd
----------------
Breathe, breathe in the air  
Don't be afraid to care  
Leave but don't leave me  
Look around and choose your own ground  
  
Long you live and high you fly  
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry  
And all you touch and all you see  
Is all your life will ever be  
  
Run, rabbit run  
Dig that hole, forget the sun  
And when at last the work is done  
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one  
  
For long you live and high you fly  
But only if you ride the tide  
And balanced on the biggest wave  
You race towards an early grave

The Old Man
John McDermott
----------------
The tears have all been shed now  
We've said our last good-bye  
His soul's been blessed and he's laid to rest  
And it's now I feel alone  
  
He was more than just a father  
A teacher my best friend  
He can still be heard in the tunes we shared  
When we play them on our own  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never will forget him for he made me what I am  
Though he may be gone memory lingers on  
And I miss him... The old man  
  
As a boy he'd take me walking  
By mountain field and stream  
And he showed me things not known to kings  
And secret between him and me.  
  
Like the colors of the pheasant  
As he rises in the dawn  
And how to fish and make a wish  
Beside the holly tree  
  
I never will forget him for he made me what I am  
Though he may be gone memory lingers on  
And I miss him... The Old Man  
  
I thought he'd live forever  
He seemed so big and strong  
But the minutes fly and the years roll by  
For a father and his son  
  
And suddenly when it happened  
There was so much left unsaid  
No second chance to tell him thanks  
For everything he's done  
  
I never will forget him for he made me what I am  
Though he may be gone memory lingers on  
And I miss him... The Old Man

Only A Dream
Kinks
----------------
Standing by the elevator  
Feeling gloomy and down  
Waiting for the flashing light  
To lift me up from the ground  
  
Then the elevator opened  
And I saw her standing there  
She had to be a young executive  
She looked so corporate and clean  
  
And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before  
On the cover of a magazine  
I didn't think she'd even look at me  
Or bother to glance my way  
  
But she actually smiled at me and said  
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day  
  
[Chorus]  
I must be dreaming if she looks at me  
I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy  
Now I've got positive emotions  
Buzzing 'round every molecule in me  
I gotta be dreaming, is it reality  
But over and over I live that memory  
Was it real or only a dream  
La la la la  
  
Was it my imagination playing tricks on me  
When she looked my way  
Maybe she took me for somebody else  
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey  
  
I wake up in the morning  
Smiling with anticipation  
Suddenly I feel alive  
Face the world with expectation  
  
I must be dreaming this world is a better place  
Was my imagination playing tricks on me  
Was it real or only a dream?  
I see a great big sunset  
  
Where only clouds used to be  
Was it all an illusion, is it fantasy  
If it's just a dream  
It's good enough for me, yeah yeah  
  
Waiting by the elevator  
Feeling optimistic and keen  
Waiting for my executive goddess  
To appear as if in a dream  
  
Then the elevator opened  
She was talking to another guy  
And I tried to say hello to her  
But I failed to even catch her eye  
  
Then everybody crowded inside  
And I sadly stood my ground  
Thinking life's just like that elevator  
It takes you up and brings you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Was it only an illusion  
Was it real or only a dream  
  
[Chorus]

Not That Far From Bethlehem
Point Of Grace
----------------
Underneath the stars  
Just a simple man and wife  
Somewhere in the dark  
His words cut the silent night  
Take my hand, for the child  
That you carry is God's own  
And though it seems the road is long  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For in our arms, we'll cherish Him  
We're not that far, from Bethlehem  
Let us celebrate  
As the Christmas's go by  
Learn to live our days  
With our hearts near to the child  
Ever drawn, ever close  
To the only love that lasts  
And though 2000 years have passed  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him  
We're not that far  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him  
We're not that far  
We're not that far, from Bethlehem

Wolf Bite
Owl City
----------------
[Verse 1:]  
It's another bad dream  
Poison in my blood stream  
I'm dying but I can't scream (Can't scream)  
Will you show me the way?  
  
It's another wolf bite  
Howlin' in the moonlight  
I wanna get my life right!  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls  
In my despair (In my despair)  
Will you be there?  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way?  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear?  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Post-chorus:]  
Will you show me the way,  
Tonight?  
Will you show me the way,  
Tonight?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
It's another nightmare  
I swear there's something out there  
So save me cause I'm so scared  
Will you show me the way?  
  
It's another warewolf  
All dressed up in sheep's wool  
And changing when the moon's full  
Will you show me the way?  
  
[Chorus:]  
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls  
In my despair (In my despair)  
Will you be there?  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way?  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear?  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls  
In my despair (In my despair)  
Will you be there?  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way?  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear?  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Outro:]  
In my despair  
Will you be there?  
Tonight

Sia
----------------
So naive, it helps me to breathe  
Your smile I keep on file  
You tickle me pink  
I love the way you think  
So when I'm feeling low I know  
I'm your greatest fan  
  
Little man I'm endlessly proud of you  
In such a short time span  
You've filled my heart with joy  
As I grow older, you grow wiser  
Watching my mistakes  
Memorize where I've gone wrong  
  
If they fall way  
I'll stay with you  
But do as I say and not as do  
Trust me and you'll see  
All I want is what is best for you  
  
Little man your head is full of dreams  
If only I could spend one day touring  
Your imagination  
If I live longer you'll grow faster  
At recognizing the traps that cause  
Me such frustration  
  
If they fall way  
I'll stay with you  
But do as I say and not as I do  
Trust me and you'll see  
All I want is what is best for you  
  
So naive, it helps me to breathe  
Your smile I keep on file  
You tickle me pink  
I love the way you think  
So when I'm feeling low I know  
I'm your greatest fan

Yeah I've got to love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.  
Beat cool down,  
Over cool down,  
I can hear that highway sound.  
  
Carol!  
Don't let him steal your heart away.  
Well I'm gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.  
  
Whoa, Carol!  
Oh, Carol!  
Don't let him steal your heart away.  
Yeah I'm gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.  
  
One more time!  
Whoa, Carol!  
Come on, Carol!  
Oh yeah!  
Oh right!  
Well I'm gonna love you darling  
If it takes me all night and day.

Burn You Up, Burn You Down
Peter Gabriel
----------------
Straight as an arrow  
Carry your intentions to the wind  
Dogs all around you  
But you cannot get the message to your friend  
  
At every rendezvous you keep on walking around  
Nighttime in the city and the rain keeps falling down  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Ill wind blows the road to go  
How many times we've told you so  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
No rhyme or reason  
No way to make it easy 'til it's done  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
So you cross onto the other side of the street  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
Should know better but you keep turning up the heat  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Oh-oh-ai-ai  
(hey hey hey hey)  
Let me feel this  
(hey hey hey hey)  
Hey-ey Hey Hey  
(hey hey hey hey)  
Make me feel it  
(hey hey hey hey)  
  
When they lose you, it can bruise you  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
Break me open, I need someone to see me  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
Make me feel it, make me feel  
  
In the city and the rain is falling down  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
You can make it happen with your eyes, with your eyes alone  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Break me open  
(Let me tell you how it all works out)  
(Never thought we had so much time to lose)  
Make me feel it  
(Just learning how to twist and shout)  
(Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use)  
Break me open  
(Let me tell you how it all works out)  
(Never thought we had so much time to lose)  
Make me feel it  
(You make me feel it)  
(Just learning how to twist and shout)  
(Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use)  
  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me, you can make me, you can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it

J Cole

She knows, she knows  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't  
You know I got a girl back home  
You got a man what you want, what you want  
What these bitches want from a nigga  
On some DMX shit  
I know them other niggas love tricking  
On some BMX shit  
But not me  
Now I'm sure you done heard about me  
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli  
Good southern bad hoes try me, they try me  
This is Martin Luther King in the club  
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch  
In his ear sayin' she down for whatever  
In the back of his mind is Coretta  
  
She knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't  
I'm passing up on bad hoes  
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want  
What she want from a nigga  
To put a ring on it  
Got a bitch on my dick right now  
And she just want to sing on it  
Got me up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire  
'Cause I told her I was sleeping  
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose  
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose  
  
She knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
My niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Rest in peace to Aaliyah  
Rest in peace to Left Eye  
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya  
Just as soon as I die  
  
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright

Anachie Gordon
Mary Black
----------------
Harking is bonnie  
And there lives my love  
My heart lies on him  
And will not remove  
It will not remove  
Oh for all that I have done  
Oh I never will forget my love anachie  
For anachie gordon  
He's bonnie and he's rough  
He'd entice any woman that ever he saw  
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me  
Oh I never will forget my love anachie  
Down came her father and he's standing by the door  
Saying jeannie you're trying the tricks of a whore  
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee  
You must marry lord sulton and leave anachie  
For anachie gorden, he's barely but a man  
Although he may be pretty but where are his lands?  
Oh the sulton's lands are broad and his towers they run high  
You must marry lord sulton and leave anachie  
With anachie gordon I'd beg for my bread  
And before I'll marry sulton it's gold to my head  
With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee  
And I'll die if I don't get me love anachie  
And you that are my parents to church you may me bring  
But unto lord sulton I'll never bear a song  
To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee  
And I'll die if I don't get me love anachie  
Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home  
And when she and her maidens so merry should have been  
When she and her maidens so merry should have been  
She went into her chambers she cried all alone  
Come to bed now jeannie me honey and my sweet  
For to style you my mistress it would be so sweet  
Be it mistress or jeannie it's all the same to me  
But in your bed lord sulton I never will lie  
And down came her father and he's spoken with reknown  
Saying you that are her maidens go loosen off her gowns  
But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee  
Saying father look I'm dying for me love anachie  
The day that jeannie married was the day that jeannie died  
And the day that yound anachie came home on the tide  
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands  
Saying oh it's been so long you've spent so long on the sands  
Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood  
They have married your jeannie and now she lies dead  
You that are her maidens go take me by the hand  
And take me to the chamber that me love she lies in  
And he's kissed her cold lips till his heart has turned to stone  
And he's died in the chamber that his love she lies in

Escucha
David Guetta
----------------
Let's hit the road and away we go  
Take a new direction to a different post  
Maybe we should try and put it on the line  
You've gotta trust me now, turn up the radio  
Tune out the world and roll with the melody  
Baby, listen close and open up your mind  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Soundtrack in the wind, like classic violins  
I can be your rhythm in the silence  
And every time we sing, it echoes in the sky  
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize  
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night  
Listen to the words as I let 'em fly  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen

Till I Met You
Regine Velasquez
----------------
INTRO  
Ooh  
  
I never dream  
'Cause I always thought that dreaming was for kids  
Just a childish thing  
  
And I could swear  
Love is just a game that children play  
And no more than a game  
  
CHORUS  
Till I met you  
I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
  
I believe you  
I believe in every word that you say  
I love you all the way  
  
Now I could swear  
Love is not a game that children play  
So tell me that you stay  
  
CHORUS  
Till I met you  
I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
Each day  
  
BRIDGE  
You and I should be together  
Can't you see  
Can't you see  
  
CHORUS  
Till I met you  
I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
Each day  
  
Till I met you  
Oh, I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
Each day  
  
Till I met you  
Till I met you

Mind Of A Man
Usher

[Usher]  
[Interlude]  
That night I said I was recording late  
I wasn't recording late  
I was just smokin' chillin' had a couple dranks  
Not much of anything  
That time I flew down to MIA  
Damn I went MIA  
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play  
And that ain't everything  
All I think about is bitches  
And everywhere I go they comin'  
Double standards that everybody talkin' bout  
The tables turned around I be throwin' up  
So I ain't tryna' justify

I Need You For Someone
The Jam
----------------
I need you to keep me straight,  
When the world don't seem so great,  
And it's hard enough you know  
I need you to be around  
When my conscience brings me down  
And the world seems so obscure  
I want you to be the one  
Who tells me off when I do wrong,  
And you know I can be bad  
I need you, I need you  
Say you'll stay, make my day  
Now what have I done,  
Was it something I said - oh dear  
I need you to turn me off,  
When you think I've said enough,  
To the extent of being a bore  
I need you to tell me no  
Slap my wrists and send me home  
Tell me I can't come again  
Now why are you crying -  
Have I gone too far - again  
I need you keep me straight,  
when the world don't seem so great  
and its hard enough you know  
I need you, I need you  
Say you'll stay  
Make my day

Crying Over You
UB40
----------------
Crying over you in the morning  
Crying over you in the evening  
Crying over you, don't know what to do  
You make me feel ashamed, people say  
It's all in the game, woman please let me explain  
Then I know you will be mine  
Everyday I pray  
To have you and to hold  
Now that you are here by my side  
I really, really don't want to cry, cry  
Crying over you in the morning  
Crying over you in the evening  
Crying over you, don't know what to do  
You make me feel ashamed, people say  
It's all in the game, woman please let me explain  
Then I know you will be mine  
And I will stop crying, crying over you  
And I will stop sighing, sighing, don't know what to do  
Dying, dying, every day  
Sighing, sighing

If I'm Not The One
'n Sync
----------------
If I'm not the one you want  
Take your time to figure out  
I'm staring at your picture every night  
The scent of you still lingers in my mind  
I wonder if you'll only feel alright  
And the sun has come out of the clouds  
And sometimes when I listen to our song  
The night seems so cold and far too long  
I want to call you up 'cause in the end  
I keep writing letters to my garbage can  
Lately it feels like I'm goin' crazy  
Baby come and lay down beside me  
If I'm not the one you want  
Who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
You'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
I feel like it's on you I can depend  
Wish I could turn back the hands of time  
Enough of building castles in the sand  
Why can't we be forever  
Lately it feels like I'm goin' crazy  
Baby come and lay down beside me  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
You'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
You'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
  
Somewhere, in the back of my mind  
I know that you will be mine  
Somehow, I wish I could rewind  
Leave all the worries behind  
  
If I'm not the one you want, I'll be the one you need  
Take your time to figure out  
I'll be the one you need  
  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
And you'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
  
I'll be the one you need

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]  
When I say jump, you say how high  
I ain't never seen nobody, how they get so high  
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane  
This party got me insane, so jump jump jump jump  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Now I'm gon take it to the roof  
Everybody with me got they own parachute  
You ain't scared of heights when you sipping on Goose  
Party all night like I'm flying jet new?  
You ain't never seen nobody get this loose  
Shawty acting naughty with her body, what it do  
Jump to this man, bump to this man  
Stomp to this man, crunk to this man  
Got another hit man  
Hold up, I wanna go up, don't wanna throw up  
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us  
Dance, the boy got us all feeling high  
Ask, the shawty, I'm a astronaut  
High rollin baby like I'm jumping on fire  
Super Bowl pimp good Year on tire  
Can I be a bird, I gotta be fly  
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there  
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air  
Up up and away take it off like mere?  
NBA balling, I don't care  
Now what do you do when you see you a shawty and she make it bounce in the
room?  
Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady, can I get on your hot air
balloon?  
Sky high, still clubbing like I'm part of the mile high  
Ears popping, Bubbalicious help me get right  
Keep popping in position after midnight  
Moese? fried chicken up in NY  
Jigga what, don't it feel good  
Houston? We gonna jump ship, all aboard  
Come around me, and we'll parlay, we're throwed?  
Cali is jumping, hit the switch on the 6 4  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Come on and jump, jump, jump [Repeat: x3]  
(All my ladies) get down, get down, get down

Speechless
Justin Bieber
----------------
What does it mean when you have nothing to say,  
When the memmories and contant thoguhts wont go away.  
There's something about you that I can't let go  
But if we never meet there's nothing to show.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
You talk to everyone except me.  
How do you expect this thing to be?  
I don't want to say good-bye  
Because you've reailed me in so fast,  
Befor I was tought how.  
  
I go mornings and nights thinking about how it could have been,  
But the pain inside didn't want to give in. And somehow I the tears seem to
fade away.  
Thinking to myself maby one day...  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
Nomater what happens to our love  
I'll always remember your touch,  
And the way you talk  
Ohh, the way you walk.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.

Fight Till Death
Slayer
----------------
Metal and men clash once more to the end  
Warriors above with the power to kill descend  
Militia of blood troops of hate march to die  
Soldiers of Hell veterans of death arise  
  
[Chorus]  
Prepare for attack  
Your body will burn  
Endless war  
There's no return  
Prepare for attack  
Death will arrive  
Your orders are clear  
No way to hide  
Fight till death  
  
Senseless death of all mankind overtakes  
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape  
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave  
There is no future no [fucking] world to [be] save[d].  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[To reign in Hell]  
  
Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man  
Reign of death what is the final command  
Scepters of hate are dropped upon the Earth  
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth  
  
[Chorus]  
[Fight till death [Repeat x 3]]

That Good
Bryan White
----------------
I can feel sorry for my friends, they must be tired  
Of all the fuss that I've been making  
But since last night I'm feeling so inspired  
It's like a dream and I'm not waking  
If they could hear you whisper they'd agree  
It's more than a love song, it's a symphony  
  
It was that good, it was that right  
That chance you get once in your life  
The answer to the prayer my heart's been praying  
It was that real, it was that strong  
That feeling just can't be wrong  
I'd go on forever if I could  
It was that good  
  
Suddenly I'm saying things I've never heard  
My soul is doing all the talking  
If it was ordinary you wouldn't hear a word  
I'd keep it to myself and just keep walking  
  
But it's no secret what you've done to me  
There's no doubt in my mind girl, I believe  
The more I think about it  
Don't know how I lived without it  
It's given new life to me, to know you agree

Best Of Times
Peter Cetera
----------------
Things get bad, times get tough  
Everybody knows  
You gotta be a little stronger  
Just to have the things you need  
Everybody knows  
If you try a little harder  
You're gonna live a whole lot longer  
  
Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour  
Going out and stayin' far too long  
  
[Chorus:]  
You got to believe in something  
When you believe in something  
These are the best of times  
You got to have faith in someone  
When you have faith in someone  
These are the best of times  
  
Don't give up, can't give in  
Never lose a minute  
It's a long hard road back from nowhere  
Love is not what you take out  
It's what you put back in it  
Take you chance, there's no doubt  
Everything will all work out  
  
See my way, I know where I'm goin'  
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up  
I want it all as soon as I can  
Right where I am  
  
Chorus

Soon they'll be scattered as they tumble down  
Although they may be swept up so invitingly  
  
I never did what I was told  
I trampled through the amber and the burnished gold  
But now I clearly see how cruel the young can be  
  
You can convince yourself of anything  
If you wish both hard and long  
And I believed that life was wonderful  
Right up to the moment when love went wrong  
I gaze up at the tree-tops and laugh  
I need somebody to shake me loose  
I want to know what happens next  
'Til I don't care at all  
There I go  
Beginning to fall

We Got Scurvy
P!nk
----------------
1, 2, 3, 4  
Our gum's are black our teeth are falling out  
We got spots on our backs so give it up and shout  
We got Scurvy we need some vitamin C  
We got Scurvy we need a lemon tree  
We got Scurvy we just chillin' on the sea  
Lets get this Scurvy started  
A pirate ain't worthy  
Till he got some Scurvy  
Since you've got Scurvy on your nervy when you sing that song  
Scurvy (Scurvy)  
We got Scurvy (scurvy)  
We got Scurvy (scurvy)  
We got Scurvy (scurvy)

I'll Fly Away
Kanye West
----------------
Some glad morning when this life is over  
I'll fly away  
To a home on God's celestial shore  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away  
  
When the shadows of this life have flown  
I'll fly away  
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away  
  
Just a few more weary days and then  
I'll fly away  
To a land where joy shall never end  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away

I'm a thick motherfucker, I sip this on his lap  
With a hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back  
Got somethin' for them niggas that react  
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

I said girl, you're a trip  
She said "I might be a trip but I ain't trippin'"  
She said, "watch these hoes cause they leeches like robbin givens'"

She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped  
I know she feeled it  
It's crazy outchea, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'  
She say, "I get it and if anything was to happen to you I be livid"  
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout that, I kill a pussy nigga, put his head on
exposición
Cause they think they caught a big fish till his body came up drippin'  
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smile while I cut the ribbon  
I took a pill, she took a pill, [?] 20 minutes now we feel it  
She said "I know you probably hit this shit a lot but you the shit in my
opinion"  
I said it never gets old, thought I'd never say never but I did it  
She said "Who you kiddin' boy, you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"  
I admit it, big booty, big titties, I admit it

With a hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back  
Got somethin' for them niggas that react

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]  
I like my girls bbw

Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

Feed you good before you catch a flight  
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]  
I admit it, I admit it  
But I got these guns on me right now  
I got these drugs on me right now  
I got the feds on me right now  
I got two buyers, want it right now  
She took her clothes off and I stopped  
Looked at my watch like "fuck it why not?"  
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out  
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord  
She said "[?] get a quick fix, hit it quit it  
But you know you ain't been with a good thick bitch in a minute"  
I said you ain't never learned that I never say never but I did it  
She said speakin' of [?] all we need is a witness  
Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'  
She said "Who you kiddin' boy, you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"

Heaven's On Fire
Venom
----------------
You think your soul is nice  
You've lived in paradise  
So now you take the stand  
You want to hold your masters hand  
You think your soul is free  
Look up and you'll see me  
The pearly gates ablaze  
The angels bear the zombies gaze  
Heavens on fire  
And there ain't nothing you can do  
Heavens on fire  
And when you die you'll go there too  
The angel's life their death  
No there ain't nothing left  
The clowns of God despise  
But torment renders no disguise  
The skies a blazing tomb  
Plenty sorrow plenty doom  
They hattle living sin  
The souls of God can't hate to win  
If God is so almighty  
They why is he enslaved  
In heavens hell by satan  
The universe his slave  
Satan rides the skies  
Look up you'll see his eyes  
Disguised as endless stars  
To keep an eye on endless wars  
Do you believe in God  
He's chained up like a dog  
And every hour he screams  
Satan rules supreme

Charlie Brown
Coldplay
----------------
Stole a key  
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet  
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me  
To set me free  
  
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene  
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me  
  
In my scarecrow dreams  
When they smashed my heart into smithereens  
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete  
Be the cartoon heart  
  
Light a fire, light a spark  
Light a fire, a flame in my heart  
  
We'll run wild oh  
We'll be glowing in the dark  
We'll be glowing in the dark  
  
All the boys, all the girls  
All that matters in the world  
All the boys, all the girls  
All that matters that occurs  
All the highs, all the lows  
As the room is spinning, oh  
  
We'll run wild  
We'll be glowing in the dark  
  
Living innocent wild  
We'll be glowing in the dark

Mother
Tori Amos
----------------
Go go go go now  
Out of the nest it's time  
Go go go now  
Circus girl without a safety net  
Here here here now don't cry  
You raised your hand for the assignment  
Tuck those ribbons under your helmet  
Be a good soldier  
First my left foot then my right behind the other  
Pantyhose running in the cold  
  
Mother the car is here  
Somebody leave the light on  
Green limousine for the redhead dancing dancing girl  
And when I dance for him  
Somebody leave the light on  
Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from  
  
I walked into your dream  
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream  
You are the clever one aren't you  
Brides in veils for you  
We told you all of our secrets  
All but one  
And don't you even try  
The phone has been disconnected  
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice  
Poison me against the moon  
  
Mother the car is here  
Somebody leave the light on  
Black chariot for the redhead dancing dancing girl  
He's gonna change my name  
Maybe you'll leave the light on  
Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from  
  
I escape into your escape into our very favorite fearscape  
It's across the sky and across my heart and I cross my legs oh my God  
First my left foot then my right behind the other  
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow  
  
Oo who mother  
Oo mother the car is here  
Maybe maybe you'll leave the light on for the for the for the dancing girl  
He's gonna change my name  
Maybe you'll leave the light  
Just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come come from  
  
Mother mother mother

(I Can't Believe) She Gives It All To Me
Conway Twitty
----------------
I pinch myself when I wake up each mornin'  
'Cause I'm constantly amazed when I see  
Exactly everything I've always wanted  
But I can't believe she gives it all to me  
Mmm, lips that warm my face with mornin' kisses  
Arms that reach to hold me tenderly  
And love that always satisfies completely  
But I can't believe she gives it all to me  
She gives me more than any one man deserves  
I who have everything am nothing without her  
Somehow she knows I need her desperately  
I can't believe she gives it all to me

Beginnings
Chicago
----------------
When I'm with you,  
It doesn't matter where we are,  
Or what we're doing,  
I'm with you that's all that matters  
  
Time passes much too quickly  
When we're together laughing  
I wish I could sing it to you. whoa-oh  
Wish I could sing it to you  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly I'm silent  
Silent  
Try and think of the right words to say  
  
When I kiss you,  
I feel a thousand different feelings,  
A pletora of chills  
All over my body.  
And when I feel them,  
I quickly try to decide which one  
I should try to put into words, woah-oh  
Try to put into words  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly I'm silent  
Silent  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Silent  
  
Only the beginning  
Of what I want to feel forever  
Yes, only the beginning  
Only just the start  
I've got to get you into my life, mama  
Got to get you next to me  
Yes, only the beginning,  
Only just the start  
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey  
Oh, all right

Have You Ever Loved A Woman
Freddie King
----------------
Have you ever loved a woman, so much you tremble in pain?  
Yes, have you ever loved a woman, so much you tremble in pain?  
Yes, all the time you know, she bears another man's name  
You just love that woman, so much it's a shame an' a sin  
Yes, you just love that woman, so much it's a shame an' a sin  
Yes, you know, yes you know, she's in love to your very best friend  
Yes, have you ever loved a woman, one that you know you can't leave her alone?  
Yes, have you ever loved a woman, one you know you can't leave her alone?  
Yes, 'cause there's somethin' deep inside a you, won't let you wreck your best
friend's home  
Hey, hey, hey

Too Many Parties Too Many Pals
Hank Williams
----------------
Too many parties and too many pals will break your heart someday  
Too many boyfriends and sociable gals may drive your sweetheart away  
Gentlemen of the jury the judge's speech began  
  
The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge a stern old man  
This prisoner here before you is a social enemy  
A lady of the evening and you know the penalty  
  
Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint  
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint  
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been  
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin  
  
We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes  
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones  
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well  
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell  
  
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how  
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now  
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then  
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men  
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done  
  
Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son  
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands  
This girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands  
Those Broadway roses and prevalent sounds at too many parties and too many
pals

Not The Only One
Bonnie Raitt
----------------
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
One chance intervention, see what it can signify  
The slightest misapprehension, baby  
And we'd have passed each other by  
When I heard your sweet voice callin'  
Saw your light come shinin' through  
I couldn't stop my heart from turning  
Churnin' out my love for you, my love to you.  
  
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
True love or perfection  
It seems like it's overdue  
Then just when you least expect it  
It comes sneakin' up on you  
When I thought that I was dreaming  
Felt your body close to mine  
Now love takes on a different meaning,  
Together till the end of time.  
  
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.

Country Boy
Freddie King
----------------
[Freddy]  
I'm just a little country boy  
Lookin' for my pride and joy  
I came to the city just to see what I could see  
I just made it in your town  
Thought I'd take a look around  
I wanna tell you baby  
Just how good you look to me  
My mama told me there will be sometime like this  
She told me there would be some moments here will flip  
She warned me of a lot of things I had to do  
But she didn't tell me I would meet somebody like you  
Somebody take a chance with me  
I want you to romance with me  
You might say I'm coy  
'Cause I'm just a little country boy  
[Margaret]  
I'm just a little country girl  
Living in a great big world  
I met some country boy  
And I've got some news for you  
He swept me right off my feet  
Made my life complete  
My heart skipped a beat  
'Cause he thrilled me through and through  
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo  
[Sung together]  
We gonna march together down the aisle today  
We gonna see the preacher in the business way  
Oh I'm so happy can't you see I'm thrilled with joy?  
[Freddy]  
(Can't believe how this could happen to a country boy)  
So come and take me by the hand (M)  
Let me be your lovin' man (F)  
I'm in a great big world (M)  
My baby is a country girl (F)  
I found my toy (M)  
I'm a country boy (F)

Crossroads
Tracy Chapman
----------------
All you folks think you own my life  
But you never made any sacrifice  
Demons they are on my trail  
I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell  
I look to the left I look to the right  
There're hands that grab me on every side  
  
All you folks think I got my price  
At which I'll sell all that is mine  
You think money rules when all else fails  
Go sell your soul and keep your shell  
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside  
All the reasons why I live my life  
  
Some say the devil be a mystical thing  
I say the devil he a walking man  
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief  
He try to tell you what you want  
Try to tell you what you need  
  
Standing at the point  
The road it cross you down  
What is at your back  
Which way do you turn  
Who will come to find you first  
Your devils or your gods  
  
All you folks think you run my life  
Say I should be willing to compromise  
I say all you demons go back to hell  
I'll save my soul save myself

Know Your Name
Ne-Yo
----------------
Disculpe
I couldn't help but notice  
You noticing me  
And I was definitely noticing you  
My name is  
You know my name  
But listen  
I have a question  
  
No it ain't like me to drop too hard, no baby  
Or go out of my way to know who you are  
Say you're not one for chasing  
But I'll admit  
Something in you  
Has got my attention girl  
So if I can  
Be a gentleman  
Can I ask your permission girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Said if it's alright with you, baby  
Can I know your name, (oh can I know your name)  
And maybe call you sometime, yeah baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name  
  
Looking at you girl I see so much  
So much potential for something better than that  
Like maybe me and you becoming us  
I'm not trying to scare you  
But in your eyes  
I can see why  
People write love songs  
And if God allowed  
I could see how  
I could love you for so long  
First things first  
  
If it's alright with you  
Can I know your name, can I know your name  
And maybe call you sometime, baby, baby  
Can I know your name, (I wanna know, know, know)  
Can I know your name  
Said if it's alright with you  
Can I know your name, (can I know your name), said I wanna know your name  
And maybe call you sometime, baby, baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name  
  
Something about you, uh  
That makes me wanna know you, mmm  
Said I wanna get to know you  
I just wanna show you me, whoa babe  
Said I really wanna get to know you  
See what this thing could be, oh  
  
Baby if it's alright  
Can I know your name, (oh can I know you're name)  
And maybe call you sometime  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Girl I wanna know, I really wann  
Girl if it's alright with you

And maybe call you sometime, baby

O Holy Night
Christmas Songs

(Lorrie Morgan)  
  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared  
And the soul felt its worth  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine  
  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error-pining  
Till he appeared  
And the soul felt it's worth  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine

Alfie
Barbra Streisand
----------------
What's it all about  
Alfie  
  
Is it just for the moment we live  
What's it all about  
When you sort it out  
Alfie  
  
Are we meant to take more than we give  
Or are we meant to be kind  
And if only fools are kind  
Alfie  
  
Then I guess  
It is wise to be cruel  
And if life belongs  
Only to the strong  
Alfie  
  
What will you lend on  
An old golden rule  
As sure as I believe  
There's a heaven above  
Alfie  
  
I know there's something much more  
Something even non-believers  
Can believe in  
I believe in love  
  
Alfie  
Without true love you just exist  
Alfie  
  
Until you find the love you've missed  
You're nothing  
Alfie  
  
When you walk let your heart lead the way  
And you'll find love any day  
Alfie

My One And Only Love
Carly Simon
----------------
The very thought of you makes my heart sing  
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring  
And you appear in all your splendor  
My one and only love  
  
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms  
In the hush of night while you're in my arms  
I feel your lips so warm and tender  
My one and only love  
  
The touch of your hand is like heaven  
A heaven that I've never known  
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak  
Tells me that you are my own  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender  
My one and only love  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender  
My one and only love

Before I Break
Uncle Tupelo
----------------
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Sunday morning, 8am  
Cursing myself again  
Drinking like this one might be my last  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talk-show hosts  
One of them that's fading fast  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live  
Thanks so much, I've had enough  
  
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
A worried man drinks a healthy drink  
But he drinks nine or ten until he's done  
Then he'll tell you his life story  
But he won't stop until he's told you and everyone  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live  
Thanks so much, I've had enough  
  
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talk-show hosts  
One of them that's fading fast  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live

Rest Of My Life
Xscape
----------------
Suddenly it happened so fast  
I couldn't believe the news that I received  
My heart stopped as I hit the floor  
I fell to my knees crying, "Lord help me"  
No matter what time brings  
All the changes we go through  
In life there's some things  
We just can't prepare for  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
Don't they know  
True love never dies  
I promise to love you  
For the rest of my life  
Life goes on, that's what they say  
Time will heal all your pain away  
But I feel, feel so alone and  
Now you're gone, how can I live on?  
No matter what time brings  
All the changes we go through  
In life there's some things  
That we just can't prepare for  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
Don't they know  
True love never dies  
I promise to love you  
For the rest of my life  
Until I see you again  
I'll hold on to sweet memories  
I'll treasure the times we spent  
I see I'd do anything  
I see your face, I see your smile  
Calling out my name  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
Don't they know  
True love never dies?  
I promise to love you  
For the rest of my life  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
I don't care what they say  
I don't care what they do  
What they think  
'Cause I promise, I promise  
To love you  
For the rest of my life  
(For the rest of my life)

Girlfriend
Ne-Yo
----------------
She's a goddess ghetto queen  
Sitting at the park eating sunflower seeds  
And I don't know if I'm being cocky  
But I swear I think that she was staring at me  
  
I stepped to her like  
Hey sugar mama you outta line  
Being how ya lookin' so fine  
Just wanna know how I could buy  
  
Some of your time  
She said sorry your not my type  
  
[Chorus]  
She blew my mind when she replied  
I gotta girlfriend  
Girl that's alright I'm not hatin'  
Just tryin' to cool wit u cool wit u  
  
Sure that's your lifestyle ain't nuthin' wrong  
To be honest girl it kinda turns me on  
I ain't even tryna to gash up a happy crib  
But you can call me when you need that alternative  
  
Or someone to hold a camera with a steady hand  
Don't you even trip  
Girl I'm your man  
Or if you decide to give the male race a second chance  
She said sorry but I'm taken  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She blew my mind when she replied  
I gotta girlfriend  
Girl it's alright I'm not hatin'  
Just trying to cool wit u cool wit u  
  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
What's crackin' with menage-a-trois?  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
  
Is it even cool if I can just watch?  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
Baby I just wanna cool wit you

Men And Women
INXS
----------------
can't see how I can  
Turn around what has been done  
I was just like a child  
With my eyes wide open  
  
History and any cause  
And my eyes are still open  
But my mouth my mouth is shut  
I'm closing off the lies  
  
Making my own mind up  
When I can I will  
How many dirty little secrets  
Were kept behind my back?  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Giving each other the sham  
  
I don't see  
How I can turn around what has been done  
I was just like a child  
With my eyes wide open  
  
Hungry at any cost  
Now my eyes are still open  
But my mouth my mouth is shut  
I'm closing out the lies and promises  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Men and women  
  
Giving me the sham  
Giving me the sham  
Giving me the sham  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Giving me the sham  
  
Men and women  
Men and women

I Believe I Can Fly
Etta James
----------------
If I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything  
If I can see it, I can do it  
I used to think that I could not go on  
And life was nothing but an awful song  
But now I know the meaning of true love  
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms  
If I can see it then I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
Think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe, I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
See I was on the verge of breaking down  
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud  
There are miracles in life I must achieve  
But first I know it starts inside of me  
If I can see it, I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
'Cause I believe in me  
I believe in me  
If I can see it then I can do it  
If I just, if I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe, I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
Think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe, I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe, I believe  
I believe I can fly and I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
I know, I know I can fly  
I know, I know I can soar  
See me running through that open door  
I, I can fly

Beautiful Child
Fleetwood Mac
----------------
Beautiful child  
Beautiful child  
You are a beautiful child  
And I am a fool once more  
  
You fell in love when I was only ten  
The years disappeared  
Much has gone by since then  
I bite my lip, can you send me away  
You touch  
I have no choice  
I have to stay  
Ooh, I had to stay  
Ooh, I had to stay  
  
Sleepless child  
There is so little time  
Your eyes say yes  
But you don't say yes  
I wish that you were mine  
I wish that you were mine  
  
You say it will be harder in the morning  
I wait for you to say, just go  
Your hands held mine so few hours  
(I fell into love)  
And I'm not a child anymore  
  
I'm not a child anymore  
I'm tall enough  
To reach for the stars  
I'm old enough  
To love you from afar  
Too trusting? Yes  
But then women usually are  
  
I'm not a child anymore  
No, I'm not a child, oh no  
Tall enough to reach for the stars  
I will do  
As I'm told  
Even if I never hold you again  
I never hold you again  
  
Sleepless child  
There is so little time  
Your eyes say yes, but you don't say yes  
I wish that you were mine (x4)

Milk Cow Blues
Glen Campbell

This was the first blues I ever learnt from  
Bob Wells and the Texas Playboys  
called the Milk Cow Blues

Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
'Tis the season to be jolly  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Sedatives
Insane Clown Posse
----------------
[Verse - Violent J]  
I like to suffocate people and bite their necks  
They got me in a place that ain't like the rest  
And all you gotta do is try to go for the neck  
And it's sedatives...sedatives...like that  
Slow down, color smear all around  
Weird sounds, you in the mind of a clown  
And a wicked one somehow spinnin' around  
Wheel me down the hallway, arms strapped down  
With sedatives.  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Hangin' all out the neck from the IV  
Sedatives for the lively  
Study me, ask me, no answer  
I'm cuttin' your neck first chance sir  
[Violent J]  
White walls, white floor, small rooms  
After sedatives, they become ballrooms  
Crows fly by my window slow  
Headed that way but lookin' at me though  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
Sedative me.  
Sedatives.  
Sedative me.  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I'm an accident, human malfunction at best  
And I'm lookin' at a scalpel diggin' into your chest  
If I could only move, but them sedatives  
You know they saving your life, them sedatives  
Some of these other patients are strong as hell  
Suffocating one creep took me long as hell  
But I took his sedatives, well I thought they were sedatives  
But they were only medatives.  
[Violent J]  
I fake pain, call 'em over and play dead  
And yank a fistful of hair out the nurse lady's head  
High on sedatives again, put me in a tiny place  
Chin strap muzzle over my face  
I threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me  
I was sedated, and that's when it hit me  
The only time I'm at peace is when I ain't even there  
God tell me, why the fuck am I here?  
[Verse - Violent J]  
I want a lobotomy, no shock therapy  
Come clean me nurse, take care of me  
I suffocated the last 2 they sent in alone  
They had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone  
Recreation time, wheel me to the courtyard  
Four guards in white and they might be important  
And the sky is blue and I can watch trees grow  
Watch leaves flow, enjoy the sedative show  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Well I even have my very own room these days  
White straight jacket, padded walls and PJ's  
But there's so many ways and every stunt I pull  
I even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl  
For attention? maybe, not to mention a sedative  
Heard one guy say "why even let it live?"  
There's probably no sedatives in Hell  
And that's the only reason I'm alive still!  
[Violent J]  
The Witch is everywhere and I can see that y'all  
Stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw  
A plastic straw, yet flimsy and weak  
But if you cork it with your thumb and hold it right..FREEEK!

Pretty Penny
Stone Temple Pilots
----------------
Have you seen your mother girl? Has she gone away?  
Gone away and found the pearl  
But the price she paid  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
How far will you go I say, just to bait a mouse?  
Shorter lived and longer gone  
Can you figure out?  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
Have you lost your sister girl? She's all but blown away  
Blown away and lost the pearl  
And the price she paid  
  
Gone - When you wake in the morning  
Gone - When you find that there's no one sleeping  
Gone - Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her

Wedding Day In Funeralville
John Prine
----------------
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
Your soup spoon's on your right  
The King and Queen will alternate  
With the refrigerator light  
They'll be boxing on the TV show  
The colored kids will sing  
Hoo ray for you and midnight's oil  
Let's burn the whole damn thing  
Felicia is my dark horse girl  
I'll take her if it rains  
She throws up punch upon the host  
And says many stupid things  
But she ain't so bad  
When we're all alone she's as different as can be  
She's a part a my heart, don'tcha pull us apart  
She's like one of the family  
Oh no, trouble in the attic  
Won't somebody turn on a light?  
Got so, so many troubles  
Can't even tell wrong from right  
I'm gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks, tip my hat and say goodnight  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
My car is stuck in Washington  
And I cannot find out why  
Come sit beside me on the swing  
And watch the angels cry  
It's anybody's ballgame  
It's everybody's fight  
And the street lamp said as he nodded his head  
It's lonesome out tonight  
Oh no, trouble in the attic  
Won't somebody turn on a light?  
Got so, so many troubles  
Can't even tell wrong from right  
I'm gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks, tip my hat and say goodnight  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?

Bad For You
Rod Stewart
----------------
Every day I wake  
Every word I speak  
Got you on my mind  
I've made love to you  
And I may not be  
The answer to your prayer  
Give me just one night  
And I'll take you there  
  
I can read your mind  
Honey I ain't blind  
You want love so hard  
It's no federal crime  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone's gotta tell me  
That you're mine all mine  
Take me to your river honey  
Fracture my mind  
I'll be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
I've got my brand on you  
I'll be bad for you  
  
When you turn around  
I'll be standing there  
Anywhere you go  
I will follow you  
Any place you walk  
Any words you talk  
I'll be by your side  
I won't let you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
I put my brand on you  
I'll be bad for you  
Bad for you  
  
Listen to me  
Be bad for me  
  
Every day I wake  
Every word I speak  
Got you on my mind  
I've made love to you  
  
When the night gets hot  
You're my only thought  
Can't control myself  
I'll make love to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
Ain't nothin' you can do  
I'll be bad for you  
Bad for you  
Nothing you can do  
I'm so bad for you baby  
I'll be bad for you baby

I got tarter on my teeth, but I don't care.

I'm a crumb and a bum, I'm a slouch and a louse.  
A crazy man who don't give a damn about his self.

I'm rude and I'm shrewd, I'm fat and I'm bad.  
I'm a man who don't give a damn 'bout who he is.

Can't Live Without You
Scorpions
----------------
You stand in front of the band  
With all those scarves in your hands  
I see you play imaginary guitars  
You people shaking your heads  
Right till the end of the set  
You really turn me on wherever we are  
  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
  
Put your hands in the air  
So I can see you are there  
I want to see all your lights shining on  
Want you to stand up and dance  
Gonna leave you no chance  
To take a breath between each single song  
  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
  
Stand up and shout  
We're ready to rock, we're ready to roll  
Stand up and shout  
Are you ready, are you ready  
Come on and get it!  
  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you

Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
You've seen life through distorted eyes  
You know you had to learn  
The execution of your mind  
You really had to turn  
The race is run the book is read  
The end begins to show  
The truth is out, the lies are old  
But you don't want to know  
  
Nobody will ever let you know  
When you ask the reasons why  
They just tell you that you're on your own  
Fill your head all full of lies  
  
The people who have crippled you  
You want to see them burn  
The gates of life have closed on you  
And now there's just no return  
You're wishing that the hands of doom  
Could take your mind away  
And you don't care if you don't see again  
The light of day  
  
Nobody will ever let you know  
When you ask the reasons why  
They just tell you that you're on your own  
Fill your head all full of lies  
  
Where can you run to  
What more can you do  
No more tomorrow  
Life is killing you  
Dreams turn to nightmares  
Heaven turns to hell  
Burned out confusion  
Nothing more to tell  
  
Everything around you  
What's it coming to  
God knows as your dog knows  
Bog blast all of you  
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  
Nothing more to do  
Living just for dying  
Dying just for you

A Thing Called Love
Johnny Cash
----------------
Six foot six he stood on the ground,  
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds,  
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love.  
He was the kind of a man that would gamble on luck,  
Look you in the eye and never back up,  
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love.  
You can't see it with your eyes,  
Hold it in your hand.  
But like the wind, it covers our land,  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,  
This thing called love.  
It can lift you up,  
Never let you down,  
Take your world and turn it all around,  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.  
Most men are like me, they struggle in doubt,  
They trouble their minds day in and day out,  
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love.  
But when I see a mother's tenderness,  
As she holds her young close to her breast,  
Then I thank god that the world's been blessed with a thing called love.  
You can't see it with your eyes,  
Hold it in your hand.  
But like the wind, it covers our land,  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,  
This thing called love.  
It can lift you up,  
Never let you down,  
Take your world and turn it all around,  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.

Tomorrow Night
Louis Armstrong
----------------
After night, you've gone away  
There's nothing I can do  
Baby, after the night, I can't make you stay  
After you telling me you're through  
  
Now after the night, there'll be somebody new  
Loving these gone red  
Tomorrow'll be another idle day for me  
After you've gone away  
  
Now you hold your life  
Having your fun  
Oh, baby, I'll be the lonely one  
I'll be  
  
After night, you'll go your way  
Thinking you've done right  
Oh, baby, I'll be here left all alone  
Mama, after the night

Penthouse Eyes
ZZ Top
----------------
What you lookin' at, girl?  
  
She's always checkin' with her penthouse eyes,  
Makes me stutter, gives me butterflies.  
Got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes.  
  
I want to lie where her eagle flies,  
She's got my love pressure on the rise.  
When I see her, she really rocks me with her penthouse eyes.  
  
Don't need excuse for graspin',  
Can't blame the boy for askin'.  
One look sting you like a honey bee,  
But it's her eyes gonna set you free.  
  
I want to stretch her out in old Levi's,  
Got to have a little piece of paradise.  
I got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes.  
  
Don't need excuse for graspin',  
Can't blame the boy for askin'.  
There's no escape let me tell you no lie,  
She's always lookin' with her penthouse eyes.

Dark Horse
George Harrison
----------------
You thought that you knew where I was and when  
But it looks like they've been foolin' you again,  
You thought that you'd got me all steaked out  
But baby looks like I've been breaking out  
  
I'm a dark horse  
Running on a dark race course  
I'm a blue moon  
Since I stepped from out of the womb  
I've been a cool jerk  
Looking for the source  
I'm a dark horse.  
  
You thought you had got me in your grip  
Baby looks like you was not so smart  
And I became too slippery for you  
But let me say that was nothing new.  
  
I'm a dark horse  
Running on a dark race course  
I'm a blue moon  
Since I picked up my first spoon  
I've been a cool jerk  
Looking for the source  
I'm a dark horse  
  
I thought that you knew it all along  
Until you started getting me not right  
Seems as if you heard a little late  
But I warned you when  
We both were at the starting gate  
  
I'm a dark horse  
Running on a dark race course  
I'm a blue moon  
Since I stepped from out of the womb  
I've been a cool jerk  
Cooking at the source  
I'm a dark horse.

----------------
In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above  
I want this hand in it's rightful glove  
Have people saying god damn she's fine  
Me responding with damn right she's mine  
Even though your gone, I try and carry on  
Its sad but it's true, me and you  
Were through  
But people still think they know us and they don't know shit  
But I want you to know I'm sorry and I still love you britt  
But now I've come to see, our destiny will never fit  
And that's why now I look back being once lost then found  
Its getting tougher with you not around  
Your the only thing that got me to smile  
I guess our love was a truthful denile  
Sometimes I remenice at what we had  
Not knowin I was causing my baby to be sad  
I never once tried to cause you this pain  
Its crazy how one person can make you go insane  
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times  
We fought, yea but people act like it's a fuckin crime  
No couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit  
All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt  
But it's sad cause the image I portray the pieces don't fit  
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me  
But I wish people could see, how much I'm so crazy  
In love with you, it's true I wish it was still me and you  
Doin what we use to do, I wish they really knew  
And I wish theyd know I'd never let anything bad happend to you  
I got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest  
But times were tough, and shit got rough  
Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought  
But just know britt my rhymes are true  
Britt please know I'll forever Love you  
It just sucks cause there's a few out there that got Nems back  
People always tellin me get your fuckin life on track  
But in order to do that I need you back  
And that's why you don't know what you got till it's gone  
I'm so sorry that our love was always off and on....

On The Verge
Tragically Hip
----------------
Here we are, now where are we?  
It's like nothing I've ever seen we got hoarse-throated huckster's whispered
trucos
Rubbernecking the curious cynics and headlong-walkers,  
One born every minute do I plug it in? or do I stick it in?  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't think I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the  
Verge  
  
Here we are, now who are you? the long lost queen's of some hoodoo?  
Well we're the last of the big-time penetrators playin'  
Dead to fuck the undertaker the movie'll come out a little bit later the men,  
The legend, the goat, the satyr  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't say I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the verge  
  
Here we are, now don't ask how the time to leave was kind now well don't cry,  
Baby, there's no cause for grief  
  
Deadheading's never gonna kill the chief it's an empty road without relief  
And I'm a highway romance milking thief  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't think I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the verge

The Clansman
Iron Maiden
----------------
Wake alone in the hills  
With the wind in your face  
It feels good to be proud  
And be free and a race  
That is part of a clan  
And to live on highlands  
And the air that you breathe  
So pure and so clean  
  
When alone on the hills  
With the wind in your hair  
With a longing to feel  
Just to be free  
  
Is it right to believe  
In the need to be free  
It's a time when you die  
And without asking why  
Can't you see what they do  
They are grinding us down  
They are taking our land  
That belongs to the clans  
  
Not alone with a dream  
Just want to be free  
With a need to belong  
I am a clansman  
Freedom  
  
It's a time wrought with fear  
It's a land wrought with change  
  
Ancestors could hear  
What is happening now  
They would turn in their graves  
They would all be ashamed  
That the land of the free  
Has been written in chains  
And I know what I want  
  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine  
I am the clansman  
  
And I swear to defend  
And we'll fight to the end  
And I swear that I'll never  
Be taken alive  
And I know that we'll stand  
And we'll fight for our land  
And I swear that my bairns Will be born free  
  
And I know what I want  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what I want  
I am the clansman  
Freedom  
  
And I know what I want When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine I am the clansman  
  
No, no we can't let them take anymore  
No we can't let them take anymore  
We've the land of the free  
Freedom  
  
Is it right to believe  
In the need to be free  
It's a time when you die  
And without asking why  
Can't you see what they do  
They are grinding us down  
They are taking our land  
That belongs to the clans  
  
Not alone with a dream  
Just want to be free  
With a need to belong  
I am a clansman  
  
And I know what I want  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine  
I am the clansman  
Freedom

Having A Good Time
Thin Lizzy
----------------
Me and my buddies, we're going to get drunk  
We're going to go out on the town  
We'll be checking it out, slipping it in  
And stepping out of line  
You know everybody likes to get a little crazy  
In their own particular way  
But my buddies and I, we go over the top  
And we're going over again today  
  
We'll be having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
Having a good time  
You know it's a rock and roll pastime  
  
It might be typical, topical or maybe tropical  
That doesn't mean anything  
If you're political, practical  
Then it's improbable that you do anything  
But me and my buddies, we like to go crazy  
We like to go over the hill  
Hey, woman, will you be there? Because my buddies and I will  
  
Having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
We'll be having a good time  
It's a rock and roll pastime  
  
"Hey, snowy, play a bit for me  
That was snowy white  
And he likes err it in the night  
The next to play  
I must say, is Scott Gorham  
And away"  
  
We'll be having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
Having a good time  
It's a rock and roll pastime  
  
Let's play that one more time  
Hit me with that drum, Brian  
Hit me as hard as you can  
Oh yes, that's they way I like it  
Do it again, do it again, let's do it again  
  
Having a good time  
Oh yes, I like this  
Having a good time  
Typical, topical, who cares?  
Having a good time  
Political, practical, impossible  
Having a good time  
  
Don't ask me why, Jack  
Having a good time  
Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!  
Having a good time  
Having a wild time  
Having a good time  
I'm slipping on the inside  
Having a good time  
That's fine, having a good time  
Having a good time  
Drinking Beaujolais  
No, that doesn't rhyme  
Having a good time  
I'm talking from the top of my head  
Having a good time  
To the bottom of your soul

A Little Of You
Eurythmics
----------------
There used to be a time  
I wore my heart upon my sleeve.  
There used to be a time  
I'd show my gentle side to anyone  
Through these years of wandering  
I know I've been deceived.  
Through these years of wandering  
  
And every time you try to hurt me  
You know you'll only hurt yourself.  
And every time you try to hurt me  
I know you'll be the one to suffer  
When you think you're hurting someone.  
  
A little of you, a little of me,  
A little of you,  
Is hurting someone  
  
Don't tell me I'm the only one  
'Cause I don't need that space.  
Don't ask for love  
I'll throw it back in your face.  
All of these promises  
Were only made to break.  
All of these promises

Lie To Me
Bon Jovi
----------------
Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down  
He's gonna pay the rent  
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get  
It feels like there is a stranger standing in these shoes  
But, I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you  
  
I know I promised baby  
I would be the one to make our dreams come true  
I ain't too proud of all the struggles  
And the hard times we've been through  
When this cold world comes between us  
Please tell me you'll be brave  
  
'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away  
If you don't love me, lie to me  
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be  
Right now if you don't love me baby, lie to me  
  
Pour another cup of coffee, babe I got something to say to you  
I ain't got the winning ticket  
Not the one that's gonna pull us through  
No one said it'd be easy, let your old man take you home  
But know if you walk out on me  
That darling, I'd be gone  
  
If you don't love me, lie to me  
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be  
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me  
Baby, I can take it  
  
It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride  
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes  
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone  
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on  
  
If you don't love me, lie to me  
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be  
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me, lie to me  
Baby I can take it

Give It Up
ZZ Top
----------------
I bet the derby and I won by a nose,  
I bet Vegas and they took my clothes.  
I bet Monte Carlo I was showin' my stuff,  
I bet on you baby, now ain't that enough?  
  
You got to give it up,  
Give it up baby.  
Give it up.  
You got to give it up, baby, tell me where it's at.  
  
Well there's a few more things you should know about me,  
I trained trigger single-handedly.  
I invented see-through negligees,  
And I bought the flying saucer off the Presley estate.  
  
You got to give it up,  
You got to give it up baby.  
Give it up.  
You got to give it up, baby, tell me where it's at.  
  
I fell in love down in Mexico,  
Thunderbird wine's the only way to go.  
I been in love ten thousand times,  
All you got to do is remember my line.

Another Day
Michael Jackson
----------------
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars  
And you're the only one that could take me this far  
I'll be forever searching for your love  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?  
  
At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of find the stars  
And you're the only one that could take me this far  
I'll be forever searching for your love  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?  
  
I walked away but I was wrong  
You're the one that makes me strong  
You're the fire that keeps me warm  
How will I get through this storm?

Jamaica Farewell Song
Chuck Berry
----------------
Down the way where the nights are gay,  
And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop,  
I took a trip on a sailing ship,  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.  
  
Down at the market you can hear,  
All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,  
Akie rice, salt fish are nice,  
And the sun is fine any time of the year.  
  
[CHORUS  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere,  
And the children sway to and fro,  
I must declare that my heart is there,  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.  
  
[CHORUS (twice)  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]

Leader Of The Pack
Bette Midler
----------------
"Hey, Betty? Is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Oh! Must be nice riding on that motorcycle after school, huh?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Is he picking you up after school today?"  
"Unh uh!"  
"Well, where'd ya meet him?"  
  
I met him at the candy store.  
He turned around and smiled at me.  
Ya get the picture? (Yes, we see)  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
My folks were always puttin' him down.  
Down! Down!  
They said he came from the wrong side of town.  
They told me that he was bad,  
But I knew that he was sad.  
And that's why I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
One day my dad said, "Find someone new."  
New! New!  
I had to tell my Jimmy that,  
Whoa, we were through.  
He stood up and then he asked me why.  
But all I could do was cry.  
I'm sorry I hurt you,  
The leader of the pack.  
  
He sort of smiled and he kissed me goodbye.  
The tears were beginning to show.  
And as he drove away from me  
On that rainy, rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow.  
But whether he heard me  
I'll never, never, never, never know!  
Look out now, now, look out!  
Whoa oh no no no! Whoa no no no! No! No!  
  
I felt so helpless! What could I do-wo-wo-wo-wo?  
The only, only love that we had was through.  
At school they all stop and stare.  
I can't hide the tears.  
I just don't care!  
I will never forget you,  
The leader of the pack!  
Whoa-oo-woh! Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is, whoa gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!

O.d. Receiver
Gary Numan

Heartbeat  
I can't see you  
Heartbeat  
I can hear you  
I feel you pumping just beyond my door  
I know exactly  
What you've crawled here for  
Cringe down lower  
You're all dressed in grey  
Me, I'm still breathing  
It's just not your day  
  
I hear you whisper like an open grave  
O.D. Receiver, I am all you crave  
You're dying, crying, I can hear you fall  
Your bony fingers scratching on my wall  
  
O.D. Receiver  
  
I hear you screaming, well at least you try  
Me, I'm still smiling but I don't know why  
I'd call a doctor if I had the time  
But I'm so busy with this fix of mine  
  
O.D. Receiver...

Harry Truman
Chicago
----------------
America needs you  
Harry Truman  
Harry could you please come home  
Things are looking bad  
I know you would be mad  
To see what kind of men  
Prevail upon the land you love  
  
America's wondering  
How we got here  
Harry all we get is lies  
We're gettin' safer cars  
Rocket ships to mars  
From men who'd sell us out  
To get themselves a piece of power  
  
We'd love to hear you speak your mind  
In plain and simple ways  
Call a spade a spade  
Like you did back in the day  
You would play piano  
Each morning walk a mile  
Speak of what was going down  
Each honesty and style  
  
America's calling  
Harry Truman  
Harry you know what to do  
The world is turnin' round and losin' lots of ground  
Oh Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Oh woah woah woah  
  
America's calling  
Harry Truman  
Harry you know what to do  
The world is turnin' round  
And losin' lots of ground  
So Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Oh  
Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Acosar
Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love

Millworker
James Taylor
----------------
Now my grandfather was a sailor,  
He blew in off the water.  
My father was a farmer and I,  
His only daughter.  
Took up with a no good millworking man  
From Massachusetts  
Who dies from too much whiskey  
And leaves me these three faces to feed.  
  
Millwork ain't easy, millwork ain't hard,  
Millwork it ain't nothing  
But an awful boring job.  
I'm waiting for a daydream  
To take me through the morning  
And put me in my coffee break  
Where I can have a sandwich and remember.  
  
Then it's me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning,  
For the rest of the afternoon  
And the rest of my life.  
  
Now my mind begins to wander  
To the days back on the farm.  
I can see my father smiling at me,  
Swinging on his arm.  
I can hear my granddad's stories  
Of the storms out on Lake Erie  
Where vessels and cargoes and fortunes  
And sailors' lives were lost.  
  
Yes, but it's my life has been wasted,  
And I have been the fool  
To let this manufacturer  
Use my body for a tool.  
I can ride home in the evening,  
Staring at my hands,  
Swearing by my sorrow  
That a young girl  
Ought to stand a better chance.  
  
So may I work the mills  
Just as long as I am able  
And never meet the man  
Whose name is on the label.  
  
It be me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning  
And the rest of the afternoon,  
Gone for the rest of my life.

Alien Shore
Rush
----------------
You and I, we are strangers by one chromosome  
Slave to the hormone, body and soul  
In a struggle to be happy and free  
Swimming in a primitive sea  
  
You and I, we must dive below the surface  
A world of red neon, and ultramarine  
Shining bridges on the ocean floor  
Reaching to the alien shore  
  
For you and me - Sex is not a competition  
For you and me - Sex is not a job description  
For you and me - We agree  
  
You and I, we are pressed into these solitudes  
Color and culture, language and race  
Just variations on a theme  
Islands in a much larger stream  
  
For you and me - Race is not a competition  
For you and me - Race is not a definition  
For you and me - We agree  
  
Reaching for the alien shore  
  
You and I, we reject these narrow attitudes  
We add to each other, like a coral reef  
Building bridges on the ocean floor  
Reaching for the alien shore  
  
For you and me - We hold these truths to be self-evident  
For you and me - We'd elect each other president  
For you and me - We might agree  
But that's just us  
  
Reaching for the alien shore

It Comes Back To You
Imagine Dragons
----------------
4 am, beside myself  
And what I think of mental health  
All the things that worry me  
All the things you don't believe  
I've been told just what to do  
Where to look, and point my view  
All the things that I could be  
I think I learnt in therapy  
  
Am I just a shadow you drew?  
  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
Looking back into the past and I can see it through  
  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
  
Mocking birds and diamond rings  
Oh I have thought of greater things  
All the things that fly by me  
All the lives that I could lead  
Maybe I was born for that  
Or maybe I was first to last  
You could call it cowardess  
But leave me to my studied bliss  
Am I just a shadow you drew?  
  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
Looking back into the past and I can see it through  
  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you

Big Day
XTC
----------------
It's your big day, your big day  
So you want to tie the knot  
Tie it tight, don't let it rot, the memory of this day  
Are you deafened by the bells  
Could be heaven, could be hell  
In a cell for two  
Big day come and big day go  
Life goes on after the show  
But will your love have the fire and glow  
Like on the big day  
Statistics they don't say a lot  
But can you keep what you have got forever together  
There's a lesson to be learnt  
Many fingers have been burnt with the touch of gold  
Love can come and love can go  
What your chance is I don't know  
But if you have love then let it show like on the big day  
You're a new recruit  
The big day  
In your wedding suit  
There's a lesson to be learnt  
Many fingers have been burnt with the touch of gold  
Big day come and big day go  
What your chance is I don't know  
But if you have love then let it show like on the big day  
Yea you're looking fine  
Big day  
Sign on the dotted line  
Big day  
It's your wedding march today, big day  
You're the new recruit  
Big day  
In your wedding suit  
Big day  
Yea you're looking fine  
Big day  
Sign on the dotted line  
Big day  
It's your wedding march today  
Big day  
Your big day  
Big day

Not My Friend
Norah Jones
----------------
Help me breathe  
Help me believe  
You seem really glad that I am sad  
  
You are not my friend  
I cannot pretend that you are  
  
You made it sting  
Your voice is ringing  
Just like the boys who laughed at me in school  
  
You are not my friend  
I cannot pretend anymore  
  
You found a place  
No one should ever go  
  
I'll be okay  
'Cause when I back away  
I'm gonna keep the handle of your gun in sight

Don't Bring Me Down
Sia
----------------
Faint light of dawn  
I'm listening to you breathing in and breathing out  
Needing nothing  
You're honey dipped  
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world  
I can't feel my lips  
  
I'm going down, I don't want to change  
I'm going down, going down the drain  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't bring me down, I beg you  
Don't bring me down, I won't let you  
Don't bring me down  
  
Then all of that's annulled and I'm anyone's everyone's  
We are one  
Your face becomes the sun  
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things  
Those little things  
The little things they bring  
  
I'm going down, I don't want to change  
I'm going down, going down the drain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So now for restless mind, I could go either way  
  
Oh but, I'm going down, I don't wanna change  
I'm going down, going down the drain  
  
Don't bring me down, I beg you  
Don't bring me down, I won't let you  
Don't bring me down, I beg you  
Don't bring me down, don't let me  
Don't bring me down,  
Don't bring me down, I won't let you  
Don't bring me down,  
  
There's nothing left to choose  
Oh I fight a word, I am right here  
Stay the night, protect me

Don't You Ever Go Away
Lionel Richie
----------------
Hey, can you tell my heart is aching  
You, It's only you that's on my mind  
I, I can not fight this feeling  
Now, now I know why love is blind  
Chorus  
From the top of my world to the bottom of my heart  
Just the way that you are, you're the one my shining star  
Everything that you do, everything that you might say  
You're the love of my life, don't you ever go away  
Love, I feel my heart could beat forever  
Kiss, when it's slow with tenderness  
Touch, when we're making love it's heaven  
Time, girl with you, there's only bliss  
Chorus  
You are everything I wanted  
And I would love to love you girl  
To the end of time  
Chorus Fade

A Change Is Gonna Come
Otis Redding
----------------
I was born by a river, oh my  
In this little old town  
Just like this river  
I've been running ever since  
It's been alone  
  
Lord, I'm coming but I know, but I know  
That changes gotta come, now  
Oh yes it is, my oh my oh my oh my  
  
It's been too hard livin', oh my  
And I'm afraid to die  
I don't know what's up there  
Beyond the clouds  
It's been alone  
  
Lord I'm coming but I know, but I know  
That changes gotta come  
Oh yes it is, my oh my oh my  
  
There's a time  
I will go to my brother, oh my  
I would ask my brother  
Will you help me please, oh now oh now  
He turned me down  
And then I asked my little mother, oh my oh  
I said mother, I said mother  
I'm down on my knees  
  
It's been time that I go  
Lord it's too late  
Very long, oh now oh  
  
Somehow I thought I was still able  
To try to carry on  
It's been alone  
Lord I'm coming but I know  
That changes gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
Huh, just like I said  
I went to my little baby brother, oh my, my little brother  
I asked my brother, brother help me please, oh now  
He turned me down  
And then I go to my little mother, my dear mother, oh now, huh  
I said mother, I said mother I'm down on my knees  
  
But there was a time that I go  
Lord it's too late  
So very long, oh my oh

To try to carry on  
It's been alone  
Lord I'm coming but I know, but I know  
That changes gotta come, ou  
It's been so long, It's been so long  
A little too long  
But changes gotta come  
So tired, so tired of suffering  
Standing by myself  
Has given up a home  
But changes gotta come  
You know, you know that I know  
And I know that you know  
Honey, That a change is gonna come, oh now, oh my

Let Us Begin
John Denver
----------------
I am the son of a grassland farmer  
Western Oklahoma 1943  
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free  
I gave up my father to South Korea  
The mind of my brother to Vietnam  
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land  
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil  
Four generations of love on this farm  
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
I had a son and my son was a soldier  
He was so like my father, he was so much like me  
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be  
He gave up his future to revolution  
His life to a battle that just can't be won  
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun  
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad  
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold  
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner  
A slave to the ways of the powers that be  
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see  
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other  
What does it take for a people to learn  
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
Have we forgotten all the lives that were given  
All the vows that were taken saying never again  
Now for the first time this could be the last time  
If peace is our vision let us begin  
Have we forgotten all the lives that were given  
All the vows that were taken saying never again, never again  
Now for the first time this could be the last time  
If peace is our vision, let us begin, let us begin

Woke Up In The Morning (Remix)
Puff Daddy
----------------
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
[Verse One by Carl Thomas]  
Why did you have to be this way  
Baby all you had to say  
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be  
But you planned a great escape  
Bright and early before I wake  
We both knew we had to break  
You could of chose a better way  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]  
It was cold the way you left  
Still the pain is in my chest  
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me  
If you put away your pride  
And look deep into my eyes  
It would of been to your surprise  
That I got up to apologize  
But you were gone  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Break: Carl Thomas]  
Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone  
It's time to carry on  
I thought that you made me happy  
But it's this thing that's come between us girl  
At one time you were my world  
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away  
  
[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]  
(Uhh) I dreams filthy  
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey  
Huh, what a set up  
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off  
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off  
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land  
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies  
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up  
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin "Bastard!"  
Cryin, know my friends is lying  
Y'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers  
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant  
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot  
Giving cats the opposite of diets  
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye  
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me  
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)  
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter  
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like  
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest  
Silencers so you can't hear it  
Competition still fear it, shit, don't ask me  
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still  
  
[Chorus By Carl Thomas 4x..music fades out]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be

What You Want
Richard Marx
----------------
Your situation's in need of help  
You're gettin' so you don't know yourself  
You wear his ring like a cheap disguise  
But I can see you got wandering eyes  
Don't believe it's just the clothes that make the man  
No one else can love you like I know I can  
  
[Chorus]  
I got what you want  
Takes more than money to turn you on  
I got what you need  
c'mon baby take a chance on me  
  
Somethin' 'bout your smile seems counterfeit  
It ain't in you to be a hypocrite  
So he's got a mansion, got lots of cash  
You live like a queen but feel like trash  
I can save you if you put your heart in mine  
Baby, can't you see, we're two of the same kind, Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, there ain't nothin' keeping chains on you  
Don't you let your head make up your mind  
  
I can't get you off my mind  
I'm afraid I may go blind  
Won't you let me take you for a ride, yeah

Purgatory
Pat Benatar
----------------
We will be the forgotten ones  
They will shake their heads and pity us  
We who sacrificed our sons and daughters  
With the sweet taste of victory on our lips  
They will cry, but their tears will come too late  
There is no redemption for the ones  
Who choose to walk in the shadows  
  
Oh sweet redeemer will you save a place for me  
I am tired and I'm seeking restitution  
Oh will you heal me, will you take away my pain  
What I'm looking for is absolution  
Getting out of Purgatory  
Is no small accomplishment  
And the price is high  
And it comes with its own set of conditions  
The choice is never clear and difficult to make  
But it will not change them  
They will just go on the way they always have  
  
Oh sweet redeemer will you save a place for me  
I am tired and I'm seeking restitution  
Oh will you heal me, will you take away my pain  
What I'm looking for is absolution

Counting Airplanes
Train
----------------
I put ketchup on my scrambled eggs  
And everybody thinks it's funny  
I don't get mad  
I don't laugh cause you don't shave your legs  
But everybody thinks it's funny  
  
No need to get mad  
I don't spend my time with anyone  
Who doesn't think I'm wonderful  
Or somewhat cash refundable at times  
  
Now I'm out here counting airplanes  
Trying to make sense of the change  
And I don't want to be just anybody  
So don't try to figure me out  
I won't try to figure you out  
  
I don't want to be some average anybody  
Now I got friends that ride into the storm  
And ride out of the storm with nothing  
They rode into the storm with  
  
And there seems to be a price for everything  
You get what you pay for then you pay for  
What you already thought you bought before  
  
When you're up between the new sky line  
The city lights and the warm sunshine  
It's a long way down  
When you can count on one hand what you love  
And can count on who you love to help you on your long way down  
  
You end up counting airplanes  
Trying to keep up with these changes  
I don't want to be with anybody else  
So don't try to figure me out  
I won't try to figure you out  
I don't want to be some average anybody

Got Me Under Pressure
ZZ Top
----------------
She likes wearin' lipstick, she likes French cuisine  
But she won't let me use my passion unless it's in a limousine.  
  
She got me under pressure,  
She got me under pressure.  
  
She likes the art museum, she don't like Pavlov's dog.  
She fun at the mind museum, she likes it in a London fog.  
She don't like other women, she likes whips and chains.  
She likes cocaine and filppin' out with great Danes.  
She's about all I can handle, it's too much for my brain.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.  
  
I'm gonna give her a message,  
Here's what I'm gonna say:  
"It's all over."  
She might get out a nightstick  
And hurt me real real bad  
By the roadside in a ditch.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.

Answer In The Sky
Elton John
----------------
Well they say that it's a fact  
If you watch the sky at night  
And if you stare into the darkness  
You might see celestial light  
And if your heart is empty  
And there's no hope in sight  
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
Well they say that it's a shame  
If you have nothing to believe  
And if you can't hold onto something  
You might as well die where you sleep  
You don't need a prayer  
And there's no price to ask why  
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And it's all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then  
And I'm banking on a chance we believe  
That good can still control the hearts of men  
  
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And it's all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then  
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe  
That good can still control the hearts of men  
  
This life's a long old road  
We shouldn't have to walk alone  
But if you find the right companion  
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown  
All life is precious  
And every day's a prize  
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
All life is precious  
And every day's a prize  
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

On A Night Like This
Kylie Minogue
----------------
Don't say it's like a fantasy  
When you know this is how it should be  
You kiss me  
I'm falling can you hear me calling  
You touch me, I want you  
Feels like I've always known you  
  
On a night like this  
I want to stay forever (stay forever)  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
On a night like this  
  
(On a, on a, on, on a, on a, on)  
(On a, on a, on, on a, on a, on)  
Now I'm getting closer to you  
Hold me, I just can't be without you  
You kiss me, I'm falling  
It's your name I'm calling  
You touch me, I want you  
Feels like I've always known you  
  
On a night like this  
I want to stay forever (stay forever)  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
On a night like this  
  
Seems like I've known you a lifetime (lifetime)  
Now it's time to make you mine  
On a night like this  
On a night like this, oh  
  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
  
On a night like this  
I want to stay forever (stay forever)  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
On a night like this  
  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
  
On a night like this  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
  
On a night like this  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
On a night like this

Sutter's Mill
Dan Fogelberg
----------------
In the Spring of Forty-seven,  
So the story, it is told,  
Old John Sutter went to the mill site  
Found a piece of shining gold.  
  
Well, he took it to the city  
Where the word, like wildfire, spread.  
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd  
Left that stone in the river bed.  
  
For they came like herds of locusts  
Every woman, child and man  
In their lumbering Conestogas  
They left their tracks upon the land.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some would fail and some would prosper  
Some would die and some would kill  
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.  
  
Well, they came from New York City,  
And they came from Alabam'  
With their dreams of finding fortunes  
In this wild unsettled land.  
  
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows  
As they tried to cross the plains.  
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains  
With their hands froze to the reins.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, some pushed on to California  
And others stopped to take their rest.  
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty  
They had opened up the west.  
  
And then the railroad came behind them  
And the land was plowed and tamed,  
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,  
He'd not one penny to his name.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill  
Some men's thirsts are never filled.

If Everyone Was Listening
Supertramp
----------------
The actors and jesters are here  
The stage is in darkness and clear  
For raising the curtain  
And no-ones quite certain whose play it is  
How long ago, how long  
If only we had listened then.  
If wed known just how right we were going to be.  
For we dreamed a lot  
And we schemed a lot  
And we tried to sing of love before the stage fell apart.  
  
If everyone was listening you know  
There'd be a chance that we could save the show  
Who'll be the last clown  
To bring the house down?  
Oh no, please no, don't let the curtain fall  
  
Well, what is your costume today?  
Who are the props in your play?  
You're acting a part which you thought from the start  
Was an honest one.  
Well how do you plead?  
An actor indeed!  
Go re-learn your lines,  
You don't know what you've done  
The finales begun.  
  
If everyone was listening you know  
There'd be a chance that we could save the show,  
Who'll be the last clown  
To bring the house down?  
Oh no, please no, don't let the curtain fall.

Pearl
Katy Perry
----------------
She is a pyramid  
But with him she's just a grain of sand  
This love's too strong like mice and men  
Squeezing out the life that should be let in  
  
She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane  
But now she's just a gust of wind  
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships  
Was a force to be reckoned with  
  
She could be a Statue of Liberty  
She could be a Joan of Arc  
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her  
So he keeps her in the dark  
  
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh  
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh  
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself  
'Cause she used to be a pearl  
  
She was unstoppable  
Moved fast as light, like an avalanche  
But now she's stuck deep in cement  
Wishing that they'd never ever met  
  
She could be a Statue of Liberty  
She could be a Joan of Arc  
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her  
So he keeps her in the dark  
  
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh  
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh  
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself  
'Cause she used to be a  
  
Do you know that there's a way out,  
There's a way out  
There's a way out  
There's a way out  
  
You don't have to be held down,  
Be held down  
Be held down  
Be held down  
  
'Cause I used to be a shell  
Yeah, I let him rule my world  
My world, oh, yeah  
  
But I woke up and grew strong  
And I can still go on  
And no one can take my pearl  
  
You don't have to be shell, no  
You're the one that rules your world, oh  
You are strong and you'll learn  
That you can still go on  
  
And you'll always be a pearl  
  
She is unstoppable

Muskrat Ramble
Harry Connick, Jr.
----------------
I look at them shuffle and the shuffle come down  
Ramblin' and scramblin' and a-headin' for town  
Hoppin' and boppin' and a-buzzin' around  
Happily awaitin' at the station  
I look at that train number 709  
Hoppin' and boppin' and arrivin' on time  
Who do you think is about to arrive  
The band they call the Dixieland Five  
  
They're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune  
Like the way you never heard it played  
Get ready for the big parade  
All together now - one and two  
Join that happy crowd  
Tellin' me that ramblin' scramblin' muskrat song  
Come on, ramble along  
Yeah

Run To The Sun
Erasure
----------------
For the first time in my life I'm up to run away  
It's not a choice that I made easily  
  
It's not that I'm ashamed to face the light of day  
It's really just a case of self-delusion  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
That I should fall from grace implies a twist of fate  
But I'm open to the joys and woes of passion  
  
And who shall take the wheel when it's time for overkill?  
There's no release when destiny is calling  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa  
  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
Somebody reach me  
Willing to teach me  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
I'll run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa

If I Love Again
Barbra Streisand
----------------
Fanny  
I often wonder why he came to me  
Brought such a flame to me  
Then let it die  
  
And if another love should find my heart  
It will remind my heart of your goodbye  
With every new love  
You'll come back to me  
  
In other eyes it's you I see  
If I love again  
Though it's someone new  
If I love again  
  
It will still be you  
In someone else's firm embrace  
I close my eyes but see your face  
If I love again  
I'll find another charms  
But I'll make believe  
  
You are in my arms  
And though my lips whisper "love me!"  
My heart will not be true  
I'll be loving you  
Every time i love again...

Just A Feeling
Maroon 5
----------------
I watched you cry  
Bathed in sunlight  
By the bathroom door  
You said you wished you did not love me anymore  
  
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car  
The things we said and did have left permanent scars  
Obsessed depressed at the same time  
I can't even walk in a straight line  
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries  
This is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes  
You're not even there  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Oh yeah  
  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
You've hit your low  
You've lost control and you want me back  
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have  
Oh just confess that you're still mine  
I roll around in a bed full of tears and  
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries this is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes you're not even there  
  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
No I can't believe that it's over now baby  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
So much to say  
It's not the way she does her hair  
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes  
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away  
The love she tried so hard to save  
  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
It's just a feeling  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
I can't believe that it's over yeah

Turn Away
James Taylor
----------------
I open my arms to hold you, you turn away you turn away.  
I feel it just like I told you, how can you turn away?  
The things that we said last Saturday night, you turn away you turn away,  
Now you want to throw that away, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And now your eyes won't meet mine, you turn away you turn away.  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.  
I'll dry these tears that I'm weeping for you and take my turn to turn away,
yeah.

Politics Of Kissing
Amy Grant
----------------
She's looking back to see if he's looking at her  
They talk without any words  
And with a smile, he's moving heaven and earth  
She dreams of holding him tight  
When will the moment be right?  
Got to be diplomatic, a step at a time, don't want to blow it, baby  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
You're finding your way as you go, go, go  
How do you know?  
Head over heels under the moon looking at you but do you feel it too  
And if I move in closer, what will you do?  
'Cause I'm thinking, please hold me tight  
Am I the light in your eyes?  
I wish you had the power for reading my mind  
'Cause I'll never say it to you  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
You're finding your way as you go, go, go  
How do you know?  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Hear what I'm sayin' to ya  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing

Communique
Dire Straits
----------------
They want to get a statement for jesus' sake  
It's like a talking to the wall  
He's incommunicado no comment to make  
He's saying nothing at all  
  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say  
Say what he means  
Maybe on Monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique  
  
Maybe he could talk about the tricks of the trade  
Maybe he could talk about himself  
Maybe he could talk about the money that he made  
Maybe he'd be saying something else  
  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say,  
Say what he means  
Maybe on monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique  
  
And now the rumors are flying  
Speculation rising  
Say that he's been trying someone else's wife  
Somebody at the airport  
Somebody on the phone  
Says he's at the station and he's coming on the noon  
Then we get the story a serious breeze  
And a photograph taken in the hall  
You don't have to worry with the previous release  
Right now, he's saying nothing at all  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say  
Say what he means  
Maybe on Monday he got something to say  
  
Communication

You Had To Be There
Tim McGraw
----------------
He sat down, picked up the phone  
And said, "Boy, I'm your old man"  
He touched the glass between the two  
As if to shake his hand  
  
The boy, he didn't budge  
Not even so much as a blink  
The man said, "Oh, come on  
Better late than never, don't you think?"  
  
He said, "I read it in the paper  
Can't believe you're 21  
Can't believe some son of mine  
Could do the things I hear you've done"  
  
He went on like some big hero  
Who flew in to save the day  
And the boy said, "If you're here  
To steer me right, man, it's too late"  
  
"You had to be there  
And I'm talkin' from day one  
That's the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son"  
  
"And you'd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  
Even if she had the time"  
  
"And I should have been learnin' how to fish  
Instead of learnin' how to smoke  
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail  
I'd never thought it was a joke"  
  
He said, "Sometimes the will  
For doin' wrong is way too strong  
For any Mama's prayers  
You had to be there"  
  
The man said, "Boy, I'm sorry  
That you hate me like you do"  
The boy said, "Dry it up, man  
We ain't makin' this about you"  
  
"It's about a teenage girl against the world  
Who was left there high and dry  
About a kid who might have stood  
A whole lot better shot at life"  
  
"But you had to be there  
And I'm talkin' from day one  
That's the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son"  
  
"You'd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  
Even if she had the time"  
  
"I should have been learnin' how to fish  
Instead of learnin' how to smoke  
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail  
I'd never thought it was a joke"  
  
He said, "Sometimes the will  
For doing wrong is way too strong  
For any Mama's prayer  
You had to be there"  
  
Before the boy hung up the phone  
He said, "They say I'm out of time"  
And it hit the man right there and then  
"My God, son, so am I"

Ain't Life Grand
Widespread Panic
----------------
Watching people roll by  
Wonder where they're going  
Hey, what's your job?  
What're you knowing?  
  
Driving to the grocery store  
Pull my money out  
Passing by the liquor store  
Throw my money down  
  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
  
My wife's got the blues  
Now I've got them  
Gonna bring her a kiss  
Make those blues run  
  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
  
The sun came out the other day  
Through those dusty clouds  
And in my mind I was a child  
And it felt good!  
  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand  
Ain't life grand

Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young
Eddie Cochran
----------------
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
Don't want slow walkin' or sad singin'  
Let 'em have a jubilee  
I wanna leave a lot of happy women  
A-thinkin' pretty thoughts of me  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I got a hot-rod car and a cowboy suit  
And I really do get around  
I got a little black book and the gals look cute  
And I know the name of ev'ry spot in town  
I wanna find 'em, fool 'em, leave 'em  
An' let 'em do the same to me  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
I'm a wampus cat let me grab my hat  
And baby come aiong with me  
We're gonna do some fancy steppin'  
We're really goin' on a spree  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
Now you may not approve of the things I do  
But it really don't bother me  
But don't ever think you can tie me down  
I'm gonna stay footloose and fancy free  
So jump back, make tracks, move out  
An' let the pretty gals at me  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory

I Never Loved A Man
Kelly Clarkson
----------------
You're no good, heart breaker,  
You're a liar and you're a cheat,  
And I don't know why  
I let you do these things to me.  
  
My friends keep telling me  
That you ain't no good.  
But oh, they don't know  
That I'd leave you if I could.  
  
I guess I'm uptight  
And I'm stuck like glue  
Cause I ain't never  
No, I ain't never, I ain't never loved,  
Loved a man the way that I love you.  
  
Some time ago I thought  
You had run out of fools  
But I was so wrong,  
You got one that you'll never lose.  
The way you treat me is a shame  
How could you hurt me so bad?  
Baby, don't you know that I'm the best thing  
That you'll ever had  
Kiss me once again,  
  
Don't you never, never say that we we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
No, I ain't never, I ain't never loved,  
Loved a man the way that I, I love you.  
  
I can't sleep at night  
And I can't even fight  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me.  
  
Whoa, oh, oh  
Yeah! Yeah!  
I ain't never loved a man, baby,  
I ain't never loved a man,  
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad,  
I ain't never loved a man.

I Won't Last A Day Without You
Barbra Streisand
----------------
Day after day I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care, you're always there  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
So, many times when the city seems to be without  
A friendly face, a lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringing  
I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near  
And love, if all my friends have forgotten half their promises  
They're not unkind, just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live  
Without the rest, I found the best  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
No, I won't last a day without you  
Can't last a day without you

Bad Seed My Daddy Sowed
Conway Twitty
----------------
I was found in Wilson County just a mile outside of town  
On the doorsteps of two people who brought me up to where I am  
I was born to be a loser and my name nobody knows  
And as far as they concern I'm just a bad seed daddy sowed  
They brough me up to the age of ten before they let me know  
And since that day it seemed that life lost its magic glow  
But they raised me right and every night in prayer we bowed our heads  
And they asked the Lord to light my path and guide each step I made  
But the path you're walking on becomes a mighty rocky road  
When you know that all you'll ever be is a bad seed daddy sowed  
At thirty one my heart was won by a girl half my age  
And with love so strong I could see no wrong in decision that I made  
And you know I learned that there was truth in all I always been told  
Because you can't judge a book by its cover  
And everything that's shinin' sure isn't gold  
Yes I guess I'm guilty of dreaming an impossible dream  
Because the way the things turned out sure isn't way it seemed  
And so tonight I'm leavin' behind the only thing I ever had to call my own  
And I know as long as you live you're always be a reminder of all my wrongs  
But I hope that he'll forgive me when he's old enough to know  
That just like me he'll always be the bad seed his daddy sowed

Driven
Rush
----------------
Driven up and down in circles  
Skidding down a road of black ice  
Staring in and out storm windows  
Driven to a fool's paradise  
  
But it's my turn to drive  
  
Driven to the margin of error  
Driven to the edge of control  
Driven to the margin of terror  
Driven to the edge of a deep, dark hole  
  
Driven day and night in circles  
Spinning like a whirlwind of leaves  
Stealing in and out back alleys  
Driven to another den of thieves  
  
But it's my turn to drive  
  
Driven in --- Driven to the edge  
Driven out --- On the thin end of the wedge  
Driven off --- By things I've never seen  
Driven on --- By the road to somewhere I've never been  
  
It's my turn to drive  
  
The road unwinds towards me  
What was there is gone  
The road unwinds before me  
And I go riding on

In the jungle I run tonight  
Find no peace to logical life  
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah.  
  
Faces, numbers I recognize  
You don't fool me with cynical lies  
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear  
Only solutions  
Oh, it won't be long, it won't take too long  
  
Modern times drive me insane  
Explanations I can't explain  
Leaves me standing in the rain, oh yeah  
  
Solving mysteries with nothing to lose  
Magic leaves you without any clues  
There's only so much one man can do, oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear  
Only solutions  
Oh it won't be long, it won't take too long

Now that the sun is shining  
Clear vision, clear vision  
  
In the jungle I run tonight  
Find no peace to logical life  
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah  
  
Faces, numbers I recognize  
You don't fool me with cynical lies  
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
It's my point of view  
Only solutions  
Oh, clear vision  
Only solutions  
No second thoughts  
Only solutions  
No, no, no contradictions  
  
People reason  
People reason  
No escape

Shine My Shoes
Robbie Williams
----------------
Another dawn, another day, another dollar to be made.  
I got a pocket in my soul, where a little rock a little roll assimilate  
And I don't care what you think you know  
'Bout who I am and how it goes  
I made it easy to be me so yeah, It's easy to be me  
And it's why I say  
(Chorus)  
I know you can't stand me cause I make you so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly and the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me, I kind of like the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
There's no room in my bed  
But while you're here just bow your head and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Get outta my lane boy, you're not in my league  
Some are born to thrive and some to underachieve  
Here's something that'll make you sick  
I'm as happy as a pig in Sh--  
I've been amused, I've been about, I've been amazed, I've been betrayed  
That's why I say  
(Chorus)  
I know you can't stand me cause I make you so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly and the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me, oh oh oh, if you can take the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
There's no room in my bed  
But while you're here just lend a hand and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Kneel down boy  
(Chorus)  
It's why you can't stand me, you make me so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly every the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me, oh oh oh, I kind of like the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
There's no room in my bed  
But while you're here then bow your head and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Until I see my face

One More Story
Peter Cetera
----------------
One more story  
Then it's time for bed  
One more fairy tale  
Then rest your weary head  
One more kiss, I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Go to sleep now  
You've had a busy day  
Hold me in your dreams  
I won't be far away  
One more kiss then I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
  
I can't believe just how fast you're growing  
I'm gonna cry when you're old enough  
To go and be on your own  
But until that very moment  
Everything's gonna be all right  
You'll still be here when I wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Everything's gonna be all right

Unsaveable
Faith Hill
----------------
Love  
So cruel  
Yeah that's all that I got from you  
Tell me what in the world could I do  
But leave  
After all that you've done to me  
Now it's so easy to say I'm over you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause Baby I cried a little too hard  
A little too long  
What I thought was right  
Was way too wrong  
And too far gone  
I can't bring back the love  
There just ain't enough  
Available  
Impossible  
Unsaveable  
  
Here  
You come  
Tryin' to make up for what you've done  
It's too late to say you're sorry now  
Now it's your turn  
For you can't cross that bridge you burned  
You're on you own when will you learn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love  
There's someone out there for me  
Who thinks I'm beautiful  
I've got to go  
  
[Chorus]

Heaven Is Paved With Broken Glass
XTC
----------------
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
All is wrong like north gone south,  
There's a bad taste in my mouth.  
  
Everything was stars,  
'Til you had a notion to leave,  
Beauty marks turned to scars,  
Bet you had a laugh up your sleeve.  
  
Congratulations love, love, love, love.  
You made a fool of me and physics.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
All is wrong like north gone south,  
There's a bad taste in my mouth.  
  
Everything was gold,  
'Til you thought you were above me,  
Soldier turns to rogue,  
Pretty turns to pretty ugly.  
  
Congratulations love, love, love, love,  
You made a fool of me and physics.  
  
And I'm feeling cheated,  
And I'm feeling used,  
And what's even worse is,  
You just look amused.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
Since your hammer struck my heart.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass.

Shades Of Cool
Lana Del Rey
----------------
My baby lives in shades of blue  
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude  
He lives in California too  
He drives a chevy Malibu  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He lives for love, he loves his drugs  
He loves his baby too  
  
But I can't fix him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
My baby lives in shades of cool  
Blue heart and hands and aptitude  
He lives for love, for women, too  
I'm one of many, one is blue  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He prays for love, he prays for peace  
And maybe someone new  
  
But I can't help him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable

And there's an angel,  
With a hand on my head  
She say I got nothing to fear  
  
There's a darkness,  
Living deep in my soul  
I still got a purpose to serve  
So let your lights shine,  
Deep into my home  
God don't let me lose my nerve,  
Don't let me lose my nerve  
  
Hey now, hey now,  
Hey now, hey now  
Wo-oh hey now

Living under my bed,  
Whispering in my ear  
And there's an angel,  
With a hand on my head  
She say I got nothing to fear  
La illaha illa Allah  
We all shine like stars  
La illaha illa Allah  
We all shine like stars  
And let it fade away

Written by Dennis DeYoung  
Lead Vocals by Dennis DeYoung  
  
I flip the switch on my laser video  
And there's the man staring back at me  
He starts to speak in a voice so righteous  
About the sins of society  
  
He's got answers to all my problems  
Says he'll decide what I should hear and see  
I try to change to another station  
But all I get is more of his morality  
And morality, yeah  
  
But I see the kids of a new generation  
And they won't stand for this mind control  
They're gonna change this world we live in  
They're gonna bring back the rock and roll  
  
So if I can, I'm gonna break from this prison  
Gonna get out and join in the fight  
Take a chance on what I believe in  
Win or lose, I know it's right  
  
'Cause it's high time  
For us to start a revolution  
High time  
Just like an A-bomb explosion  
High time  
It ain't the music that's in question  
High time  
It's more the freedom of expression  
  
Change is comin'  
Mind Police are comin'  
We're on the move  
The Old World is crumblin'  
A new day's comin'

To Where You Are
Richard Marx
----------------
Who can say for certain  
Maybe you're still here  
I feel you all around me  
Your memory's so clear  
Deep in the stillness  
I can hear you speak  
You're still an inspiration  
Can it be  
That you are mine  
Forever love  
And you are watching over me from up above  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for awhile to know you're there  
A breath away's not far  
To where you are  
Are you gently sleeping  
Here inside my dream  
And isn't faith believing  
All power can't be seen  
As my heart holds you  
Just one beat away  
I cherish all you gave me everyday  
'Cause you are mine  
Forever love  
Watching me from up above  
And I believe  
That angels breathe  
And that love will live on and never leave  
Fly me up  
To where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for awhile  
To know you're there  
A breath away's not far  
To where you are  
I know you're there  
A breath away's not far  
To where you are

Hammer In My Heart
Utopia
----------------
There's a hammer in my heart  
Pounding out your name  
There's a hammer in my heart  
Here it comes again  
  
I hear a certain sound  
And it just won't go away  
It sends a message out  
What's it gonna be today?  
  
It wakes me up at dawn  
And as the day goes on  
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on  
It never lets me rest  
  
I can't get a minute's peace  
I lay awake in bed  
Wondering will it ever cease?  
It's like a top ten song  
  
I hear it all day long  
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on

Alice In Chains

Blame me  
Save a prayer for those who haunt you  
There now  
I don't mind if you still love me  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Shame me  
Hide your heart from those who hunt you  
Way down (down, down)  
Would you care if I still need her  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Save me  
Taken far from those who flaunt you  
Calm down  
Drag your heart and you behind her  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone

Don't Mention Memphis
Tim McGraw
----------------
Mister can you take me into Little Rock  
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck  
I'll listen all night if you want to talk  
Just don't mention Memphis  
We can talk about your family  
Politics, music and philosophy  
Any ol' subject's alright with me  
Just don't mention Memphis  
  
[Chorus:]  
Or blue eyes, and light brown hair  
An angel waving to me from the top of the stairs  
The hardest thing I did was leave her standing there  
So don't mention Memphis  
  
Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup  
We'll make Texas with a little luck  
And I'm hanging with you till the sun comes up  
So don't mention Memphis  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna talk about Memphis  
And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there  
So don't mention Memphis  
I don't wanna talk about Memphis

Famous Last Words
Tears For Fears
----------------
After the wash  
Before the fire  
I will decay  
Melt in your arms  
As the day hits the night  
We will sit by candlelight  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
A for a heart  
B for a brain  
Insects and grass  
Are all that remain  
When the light from above  
Burns a hole straight through our love  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
And we will carry war no more  
All our love and all our of pain  
Will be but a tune  
The Sun and the Moon  
The wind and the rain  
Hand in hand we'll do and die  
Listening to the band that made us cry  
We'll have nothing to lose  
We'll have nothing to gain  
Just to stay this real life situation  
For one last refrain  
As the day hits the night  
We will sit by candlelight  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
And we will carry war no more

I Can't Change My Tune
Hank Williams Jr.
----------------
Babe, I can't change my tune for you  
But I'll sing any melody you want me to  
I'll sing all the country and all of the blues  
But babe, I can't change my tune for you  
So don't ask me to  
  
But babe, I can pull some strings for you  
I'll pull them until each one is in tune  
I'll try to make things go like you want to  
But babe, I can't change my tune for you  
But I'll pull strings for you  
  
Maybe I'll write a song about you  
Even though I am just passing through  
I'll sing you all the old songs and all of the new  
'Cause babe, I can't change my tune for you  
So don't ask me to

Well it looks like it's another Skynyrd Family Christmas time  
Seems like it was just New Years day  
Started out in old L.A.  
  
Those big wheels keep turning once again  
Well this bus we ride we call our home  
And it's what keeps us moving on  
But eleven months on this road  
I'm going home  
  
Family's there trimming the tree  
Cooking that turkey waiting on me  
Just like Santa I'll be right on time  
38'll be there too  
  
CDB will be guiding you to another Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing

I'm Not Important To You
Sia
----------------
You took me for granted  
You took me, you took me for granted  
But I landed back on my feet, back on  
My feet  
Cause you don't deserve me, deserve me  
You don't have the time that I need  
That I want, I deserve  
But I got back my nerve  
Did what was right for me  
I'm using my head not my heart  
And I'm starting new  
I'm going to get over you, over you  
  
I'm not important to you  
I'm not important to you  
I'm not important to you  
I'm not important to you  
  
You happy is all I wanted to see, is all  
I wanted to see, to see  
And so now that's what  
I'm going to be, what I'm going to be  
I'll waste some time on me  
I gave you my all and you took it  
I saw and you gave nothing back  
Your mind on another track,  
Another track, another track yeah  
There are plenty of people out there  
Who would care about me  
You'll see  
You'll see  
  
I'm not important to you  
I'm not important to you  
I'm not important to you  
I'm not important to you

Maggie's Farm
Rage Against The Machine
----------------
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.  
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Well, I wake up in the morning  
Fold my hands and pray for rain.  
I got a head full of ideas  
That are drivin' me insane  
Es una pena
The way she makes me  
Scrub the floor  
I ain't gonna work on, nah  
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Nah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Well, he hands you a nickel  
And he hands you a dime  
And he asks you with a grin  
If you're havin' a good time  
Then he fines you every time you slam the door  
I ain't gonna work for, nah  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
Well, he puts his cigar  
Out in your face just for kicks  
His bedroom window  
It is made out of bricks  
The National Guard stands around his door  
I ain't gonna work, nah  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
Well, she talks to all the servants  
About man and God and law  
And everybody says  
She's the brains behind pa  
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four  
I ain't gonna work for, nah  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
  
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Well I try my best  
To be just like I am  
But everybody wants you  
To be just like them  
They sing while they slave and just get bored  
I ain't gonna work on, nah  
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Start!
The Jam
----------------
It's not important for you to know my name -  
Nor I to know yours  
If we communicate for two minutes only  
It will be enough  
For knowing that someone in this world  
Feels as desperate as me -  
And what you give is what you get.  
  
It doesn't matter if we never meet again,  
What we have said will always remain.  
If we get through for two minutes only,  
It will be a start!  
For knowing that someone in this life,  
Loves with a passion called hate  
And what you give is what you get.  
  
If I never ever see you -  
If I never ever see you -  
If I never ever see you - again.  
  
And what you give is what you get!

Ok, I walked inside the club with my grills on

It's Just A Matter Of Time
Randy Travis
----------------
Someday, someway you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes darling, you're going to need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
Go on, go on til you reach the end of the line  
Cause I know you'll pass my way again  
Its just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had  
  
You laughed and you called me a clown  
Remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
That my love is a true love  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Words are spoken with chords played  
Someday and someway  
Girl you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes darling, I know you gonna need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Continue singing here  
After I gave you everything I had  
You laughed and you called me a clown  
But remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
  
That my love was a true love  
Its just a matter of time

Strangers In The Night
Cake
----------------
Strangers in the night, exchanging glances  
Wondering in the night what were the chances  
We'd be sharing love before the night was through  
  
Something in your eyes was so inviting  
Something in your smile was so exciting  
Something in my heart told me I must have you  
  
Strangers in the night, two lonely people  
We were strangers in the night  
Up to the moment when we said our first hello  
Little did we know, love was just a glance away  
A warm embracing dance away and  
  
Ever since that night, we've been together  
Lovers at first sight in love forever  
It turned out so right for strangers in the night  
  
Love was just a glance away  
A warm embracing dance away and  
  
Ever since that night, we've been together  
Lovers at first sight in love forever  
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

And The Bells Rang
Bing Crosby
----------------
Caroling, caroling, now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling through the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
And the bells rang and the children sang  
It was Christmas everywhere  
  
They took some holly, took some mistletoe  
Found a wind free night, sprinkled it with snow  
Found some reindeer's and a reindeer sleigh  
And a shiny start to show the way  
  
They found some tinsel, bright and glittery  
Where the candy came on a tiny tree  
All the happy songs the children sing  
And some jingle bells that ring, ring, ring  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
There was music in the air  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
It was Christmas everywhere  
  
(And the bells rang)  
They found some stories children love to hear  
(And the children sang)  
Filled with stockings, full of Christmas cheer  
  
Found three wise men all traveling  
Found the wise wise men and a new born king  
  
(And the bells rang)  
And when they finished, trimming every tree each  
(And the children sang)  
The bells begin to ring, oh, so merrily  
(It was Christmas everywhere)  
Tell the world we found a way  
To put together merry Christmas day  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
There was music in the air  
  
And the bells rang  
(And the bells rang)  
And the children sang  
(And the children sang)  
It was Christmas everywhere

Words
Glen Campbell
----------------
Smile an everlasting smile a smile could bring you near to me  
Don't ever let me find you're gone cause that would bring a tear to me  
This world has lost its glory let's start a brand new story now my love  
Right now there'll be no other time and I can show you all my love  
  
Talk an everlasting words and dedicate them all to me  
And I will give you all my love I'm here if you should call to me  
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away  
  
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away

Ppr:kut
Linkin Park
----------------
Why's does it feel like night today?  
Something in here's not right today  
Why am I so uptight today?  
Paranoia's all I got left  
I don't know what stressed me first  
Or how the pressure was fed  
But I know just what it feels like  
To have a voice in the back of my head  
It's like a face that I hold inside  
A face that awakes when I close my eyes  
A face that watches everytime I lie  
A face that laughs everytime I fall  
(And watches everything)  
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim  
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
Hey yo  
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind  
But I find myself in places with names but no faces  
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees  
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed  
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall  
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all  
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name  
I need somebody to help me out of the flames  
  
All I'm trying to do is just master me  
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat  
But something keeps talking to me consciously  
Responsibly it keeps haunting me  
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya  
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia  
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose  
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse  
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead  
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
The face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!  
  
The sun goes down  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun goes down  
  
It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun  
  
Can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

Get A Little Dirt On
David Allan Coe
----------------
When I was a little boy  
Daddy used to say to me son  
We got a lotta land  
And a lotta hard work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your pappy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well, I reached twenty one  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
Left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said hold up the bank boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way you'll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well, it's four in the morning  
And the warden is calling my name  
He said he's teaching me a lesson now  
He's making me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch boy, fill it up  
I'm wantin' you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands  
Get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey David gotta get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big big man  
You better remember what old whispering bill told you in this song  
Get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you wanna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
I gotta little dirt on my hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands

If You Know What I Mean
Neil Diamond
----------------
When the night returns just like a friend  
When the evening comes to set me free  
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day  
Make peaceful sounds in me  
Took a drag from my last cigarette  
Took a drink from a glass of old wine  
I closed my eyes, and I could make it real  
And feel it one more time  
  
Can you hear it, babe  
Can you hear it, babe  
From another time  
From another place  
Do you remember it, babe  
  
And the radio played like a carnival tune  
As we lay in our bed in the other room  
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream  
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean  
  
Here's to the songs we used to sing  
And here's to the times we used to know  
It's hard to hold them in our arms again  
But hard to let them go  
  
Do you hear it, babe  
Do you hear it, babe  
It was another time  
It was another place  
Do you remember it, babe  
  
And the radio played like a carnival tune  
As we lay in our bed in the other room  
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream  
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean

I Love Paris
Nat King Cole
----------------
Nat king cole  
(cole porter)  
("can-can")  
  
Every time I look down on this timeless town  
Whether blue or gray be her skies.  
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,  
More and more do I realize:  
  
I love paris in the springtime.  
I love paris in the fall.  
I love paris in the winter when it drizzles,  
I love paris in the summer when it sizzles.  
  
I love paris every moment,  
Every moment of the year.  
I love paris, why, oh why do I love paris?  
Because my love is near.

I Got Law
Blur
----------------
Feeling daft beyond gone bland  
Made it to the goal on lense  
President, he just got hair down below  
Tomorrow never more...  
Made it to the BCP  
Everybody knows it's me  
I got up another sand,  
The guilty cell  
Tomorrow never more...  
  
I Got The Law (x23)  
  
Feeling Dove beyond con-pen (Convict Penitentiary)  
Nobody can take it there  
Feel it now and do yourself until you're gone  
Tomorrow never more...  
Tomorrow never more...

(The man standing next to you)  
(He must surely be your brother)  
(So brother please)  
Heed the call

There's still time for singing  
Let's not waste our morning  
Join in the singing  
The outlaw of the midnight  
He all too soon comes winging  
(So brother please, please)  
Heed the call

There's a red house over yonder,

Lord, there's a red house over yonder  
Lord, that's where my baby stays  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
In ninety nine and one half days  
  
Wait a minute, something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this door  
Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy  
This key won't unlock this door,  
Something's goin' on here  
I have a bad bad feeling  
That my baby don't live here no more  
  
Well, I might as well go back over yonder,  
Way back up on the hill  
That's something to do  
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder,  
Way back yonder cross the hill  
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more  
I know her sister will  
Yeah.

Dickhead
Jimmy Buffett
----------------
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
  
He's got a pretty girlfriend  
and he flirts behind her back.  
He looks at other women,  
tries to get them in the sack.  
He tells her that he loves her,  
then he doesn't call for days.  
When it comes to bein' a Dickhead,  
he's got a million ways.  
  
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
  
When he's out drivin' he's a Dickhead in his car.  
When he's out drinkin' he's a Dickhead in the bar.  
When he's at a party he's a Dickhead drinkin' beer.  
He's got to be the winner of " Dickhead Of The Year".  
  
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
  
If he's got no job he's a Dickhead out of work.  
If he's got no manners he's a Dickhead and a jerk.  
If he's got no money he's a Dickhead with no class.  
If he's got no brains he's a Dickhead and an ass.  
  
He ain't nothin' but a Dickhead.  
He's been one all his life.  
If he ever gets married  
he'll be a Dickhead with a wife.  
He's got no damned excuse.  
God knows how he tries.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.  
He'll be a fuckin' Dickhead until the day he dies.

Day Job
Grateful Dead
----------------
Maybe you collect or maybe you pay (whether)  
Still got to work that eight hour day  
Whether you like that job or not  
Youd better keep it on ice while youre lining up your long shot  
  
Which is to say, hey hey, keep your day job  
Don't give it away, keep your day job, whatever they say  
Keep your day job till your night job pays.  
  
Steady boys starting that eight day hour  
Never underrate that paycheck power  
By now you know that the face on your dollar  
Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar  
With a chance to say, hey hey, keep your day job....  
  
Daddy may drive a v-8 vette  
Mama may bathe in champagne yet  
God bless the child that's got his own stash  
Nine to five and a place to crash  
Which is to say...  
Sunday comes forget about work, ring that bell for whatever its worth.  
If you ask me like I know you wont  
Ill tell you what to do what I know that you wont.

Savage Earth Heart
Waterboys
----------------
Ooooh!  
...let me see the savage  
I want to see the savage coming  
crashing through your face  
I want to be there  
when the savage comes  
I want to be there  
when the savage comes  
When your savage earth heart  
cuts through  
I want to be a witness  
or a victim to your spell  
Crackling in lightening  
dressed in shadows  
Red like a carousel  
I want to be there  
when the savage comes  
I want to be there  
when the savage comes  
when your savage earth heart  
...cuts through  
Will you lay all of your  
deepest wildest secrets bare?  
Will you let all of those  
rumbling old gods take rage?  
I want to be there  
when the savage comes  
I want to be there  
when the savage comes  
When your savage earth heart  
cuts through!  
Then I was taken smoothly  
by the vulture of the soul  
That hideous strength  
that numbs the tongue  
And he led me like a cinder  
through the fields of hell  
to doubt my friends and to hate myself  
But when my savage earth heart  
...cuts through  
When my savage earth heart  
cuts through  
Then my savage earth heart  
...cuts through  
And the culture of the soul laid waste

I remember what my father said  
He said "You don't slow down  
You're gonna end up dead"  
I remember what my brother said  
He said "You're runnin blind  
Like a bird flyin' into the sun"... Yeah  
  
They might be older than me  
But the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see  
  
Old man with a new brown bag  
Washed away his home  
Hung over the nag  
Threw the ring in the river  
At the end of the street  
Then he laid on down in the park  
With the bag at his feet... Yeah  
  
He might think he's really free  
But the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see  
All... All ya'll  
  
Try to push it further  
Than you think your life is worth  
Or you'll get nowhere  
Spendin' all your time with the devil  
Grind... Your mind  
'Stead of sittin home  
Lyin' in your bed  
Sayin you just don't care... Well...  
  
Big Daddy from the back of the cell  
Said "You want to last  
You gotta run like hell"  
But Big Daddy must been runnin' slow  
He told me the view's real good  
From the top of the rope... Yeah  
  
It's overcast with an ill decree  
And the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see

Love Won't Let Me Wait
Luther Vandross
----------------
I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun  
  
The time is right, you hold me tight  
And love's got me high  
Please tell me, 'Yes' and don't say, 'No'  
Honey, not tonight  
  
Move a little close to me, you owe it to yourself  
And I will selfishly take a little for myself  
And it's because of you  
That love won't let me wait  
  
Yeah, yeah  
  
The time is right, turn down the lights  
And take my hand, ooh, ooh, yeah  
We'll take a flight and spend the night  
In wonderland  
  
And I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun  
Creep through your window pane  
Because love won't let me wait  
Not another minute  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
  
And I need your love so desperately and only you can set me free  
When I make to you, we'll explode in ecstasy  
And I won't take the blame  
That love won't let me wait  
  
Love won't, no, no, no  
Love won't, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no  
(Love won't let me wait)  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Love won't  
I said  
(Love won't let me wait)  
  
My baby  
My temperature's risin', ooh  
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me  
  
Not another minute  
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me  
  
Baby, baby  
(I can't wait) I can't wait (I can't wait) I can't wait, I can't wait (I can't
wait)  
I can't wait, no, no, no, can't wait  
(Wait) No way, no way, no, no, no, no  
No way, no way, no, no  
(Doo,ooh,) Ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,yeah  
(Wait) I cant wait not another minute  
Not another minute (I can't wait, I can't wait) I'll be there (I can't wait)
yes, I will  
I'll be there

Lets Take A Lifetime
Chicago
----------------
Say no more,  
If you want to kiss goodnight,  
That's alright by me.  
Close your door,  
Make sure the latch is tight,  
Fall gently to sleep.  
  
We don't have to rush ahead,  
Putting questions in your head,  
And an ache in your heart,  
  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that we desire,  
Build it day by day into forever.  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that you require,  
Here and now and ever.  
  
In these times,  
Love is not some harmless game,  
It's played strictly for keeps.  
No, It's no crime,  
Wanting me to feel the same,  
With the water so deep.  
Come tomorrow once again,  
We'll be together until then,  
We've dreaming to do.  
  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that you desire.  
Build it day by day into forever  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that you require.  
Here and now and lasting ever more.  
  
So hard to leave you standing there in the light,  
You look so lovely.  
If we must  
No use tempting fate.

Who Can Blame You
Alison Krauss
----------------
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
You justify yourself in your love for someone else  
When you say, I never loved you anyway  
Your vows were made in vain, although my love still remains  
Though you broke my heart in two, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed  
'Til the day she was asking you to stay  
You turned your head from the tears I've shed  
Though you broke a heart in two, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you

Remedy
Adele
----------------
[Verse 1]  
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be  
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe  
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life  
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be  
Every story has its scars  
  
[Chorus]  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be, I will be your remedy  
Ohhh, ohhh  
  
[Verse 2]  
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you  
Come whatever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through  
Your love, it is my truth  
And I will always love you  
Love you, love you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be, I will be your remedy  
Ohhh, ohhh

He Ain't Comin' Home No More
Nina Simone
----------------
Oh stairs ... you look so high tonight  
CLIMBIN' UP with all my might  
Where I got no heart to be  
'Cause he ain't comin' home no more.  
  
Oh room ... I'm all alone with you  
Tell me what's a women to do  
When her man is gone  
And he ain't comin' home no more.  
  
I'm all choked up ... inside me  
Try'na hold back my tears  
You know ... I just can't GET USED  
I just can't USED TO this loneliness  
How AM I gonna face the empty years.  
  
Oh chair ... Oh chair  
You sittin' silent there  
Don't you even care  
That my baby's gone ... yea, yea  
And he ain't comin' home no more  
  
Yes ... for my baby's gone  
And he ain't comin' home no more

You're Holy Lord
Indiana Bible College

Verse 1

The trees wave their branches in adoration to Your name

More Today Than Yesterday
Andy Williams
----------------
I don't remember what day it was  
I didn't notice what time it wa-as  
All I know is that I fell in love with you  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you...  
  
Every day's a new day in love with you  
With each day comes a new way of loving you  
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away  
Cupid, we don't need you now, be on your way  
I thank the Lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger  
And I always will be true  
I know you feel the same way too  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every way's a new way, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day [fade]

Electric Lady
Justin Timberlake
----------------
Oh my, this beat in my heart  
Just in the dark but you're lightning my eyes  
Said I watch you ignite in fire  
And you got a power  
You're damn right  
This life I did  
Not gonna make it if you don't connect tonight right  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
You're reaching my heart fast  
You're searching for something  
That's just how electricity behaves  
Now I need it in somewhere  
The others don't last  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
Glow as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Love won't die  
So what you're giving me girl  
That energy giving  
You know how it goes sometimes  
Love won't die  
Love won't die  
But if you need it girl  
I got energy come and get it  
Sometimes I need to give a little  
Get a little, forget a little  
We could meet any place  
I... You got the power  
Baby you know if you ever go  
And you're back into the light  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
You're reaching my heart fast  
You're searching for something  
That's just how electricity behaves  
And I've been needing it so bad  
The others don't last  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
I should've known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
I should've known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady

White Whale
Guided By Voices
----------------
Come now Antoine give me your hand  
I will fly you across the land  
You were nobody  
Now you're somebody  
We will search for the dream of the king  
And friends will hate us  
And you will lead us  
You can't change the plan when it's made  
But we have changed it  
Chorus: Die for your freedom while you can  
You can always use new blood  
??Sing me Lila negation cow??  
??Fish will follow with eyes man??  
Hand on my shoulders  
March with true soldiers  
And in fact dear the flesh is no more  
Was burnt for our savior  
Offensive behavior  
And the last whale will swim to the shore  
And the new land of danger  
Chorus

Crazy Little Thing Called Love
Queen
----------------
This thing called love, I just can't handle it  
This thing called love, I must get round to it  
I ain't ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing (this thing)  
Called love (called love)  
It cries (like a baby)  
In a cradle all night  
It swings (woo woo)  
It jives (woo woo)  
It shakes all over like a jelly fish  
I kinda like it  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
There goes my baby  
She knows how to rock 'n' roll  
She drives me crazy  
She gives me hot and cold fever  
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat  
  
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip  
And get on my track's  
Take a back seat, hitch-hike  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until I'm ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip  
And get on my track's  
Take a back seat (ah hum), hitch-hike (ah hum)  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie)  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing called love, I just can't handle it  
This thing called love, I must get round to it

Broken Down
Eric Clapton
----------------
Everything was wonderful when you were in my life.  
Yesterday we were on a roll, baby, then we end up in a fight.  
Everywhere I look, I see problems, where I never seen before.  
The cracks in the sidewalk, when I get home my key don't even fit the door.  
  
[Chorus:]  
The moon don't shine, it's broken down.  
The clouds are crying, they're broken down.  
The car won't start, it's broken down.  
And this shattered heart, it's broken down.  
My whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
  
Stepped outside into the night, I took a walk around the block.  
I stopped by the church that I used to go inside but even that door was
locked.  
So I came back home, feeling so alone, a light had burned out in the hall.  
My TV is broke, said I'm out of smoke, there's no one I can even call.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said my whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
  
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.  
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I mean my whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
My whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, it's broken down.

Under Moonshine
Moody Blues
----------------
The dawn crept into by room  
And stole my dream  
Now I'll never know  
Just what it means  
Or what could have been  
Yet still I try to lie  
But I'm seen  
  
Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
  
Creator of dreams that melt with the sun  
I'll send you the things this man has done  
He was a saint and a sinner rolled in one  
But I miss now that he's gone  
I sure miss him now that he's gone  
  
Sure I feel the pain  
Deep inside I pour like rain  
Remember when you smile  
Love's in your eyes  
  
The world keeps turning  
The grass still grows green  
The fruit on my tree  
Is the biggest you've ever seen  
Which way up you know when you're down  
They've gotta stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
You must stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Or maybe I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
For you won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree  
  
Yes I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
You won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree

Sweetheart
Lloyd Cole
----------------
I got your letter baby the one that said  
You been loving me too long maybe we should kick it in the head  
Right on  
Well I guess you've really got some kind of way with words  
Maybe you could be a writer  
You could do worse  
'Cause when I saw you I just knew  
I always would belong to you  
Goodbye baby, well you'll never see my smiling face  
Sweetheart, sweet jane  
Guess you'll find some other killing to take my place  
Ha ha, all right  
I want my photographs back and my barcelino  
Keep the cartier babe I wouldn't give you the time of day  
Born a lady to the last perfumed stationery  
Does it make you feel good to make me feel ordinary?  
'Cause when I saw you I just knew  
I always would belong to you  
Goodbye baby, well you'll never see my smiling face  
Sweetheart, my complete heart's  
Trashed and bleeding with the sordid details in my suitcase  
Right on

Mansion On The Hill
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
There's a place out on the edge of town, sir,  
Risin' above the factories and the fields  
Now, ever since I was a child, I can remember  
That mansion on the hill  
  
In the day you can see the children playing  
On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel  
Steel gates that completely surround, sir,  
The mansion on the hill  
  
At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride  
Through the streets of a town so silent and still  
Park on a back road along the highway side  
Look up at that mansion on the hill  
  
In the summer all the lights would shine  
There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time  
Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields  
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill  
  
Tonight down here in Linden Town  
I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill  
There's a beautiful full moon rising  
Above the mansion on the hill

All You Get From Love Is A Love Song
Carpenters
----------------
Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere  
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze  
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'  
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding  
The future that lies before me I cannot see  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising  
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
(Got to take the blame for an old love song)  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start

Go with what I've sent you...Someone to love

Listen to the music in my soul  
Ahhhh...  
  
I see words inside your eyes  
They beg me not to leave  
Could it be we might have passed  
On the same road to loneliness  
  
Let us put bad memories  
Of our past up on the shelf  
(And leave it there forever)  
And give ourselves a second chance  
To enjoy love's priceless wealth  
  
Don't it make you wanna shout "Hallelujah"  
When you're feeling love go through ya  
Somebody strike up the band  
Here it comes again  
  
Doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo

Hear My Heart
Dean Martin
----------------
Hear my heart hear the sound it makes of love  
The sound that whispers I love only you  
Every beat seems to tell me that we'll meet  
Yet I know you're meeting someone new  
  
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes I'll know it then  
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again  
  
Ask you're heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes I'll know it then  
But if there's a chance then darling we'll have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again

It's All Gone
Chris Rea
----------------
A careless heart ain't no good to no-one  
I was going back my friends to see  
Of what became of my childhood daydreams  
Of all the things that used to be  
To my surprise I stood alone  
I walked a river of a waking dream  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
  
It's all gone  
Ain't nothing for you here now  
Sail on  
  
You talk of change, something better  
Cutting down that big old tree  
There's flesh and blood in there somewhere  
But no matter what you just don't seem to see  
I walk your chambers, your empty halls  
I see you talking behind the doors  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
  
It's all gone  
Ain't nothing for you here now  
Sail on  
  
I'm sailing on, I'm running faster  
Than I ever run before  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
Sail on

He Stopped Loving Her Today
Johnny Cash
----------------
He said "I'll love you till I die",  
She told him "You'll forget in time"  
As the years went slowly by,  
She still preyed upon his mind  
  
He kept her picture on his wall,  
Went half-crazy now and then  
He still loved her through it all,  
Hoping she'd come back again  
  
Kept some letters by his bed  
Dated nineteen sixty-two  
He had underlined in red  
Every single "I love you"  
  
I went to see him just today,  
Oh but I didn't see no tears  
All dressed up to go away, first time  
I'd seen him smile in years  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon they'll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today  
  
You know,  
She came to see him one last time.  
Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she would.  
And it kept runnin' through my mind  
"This time he's over her for good."  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon they'll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today

Tattooed Dancer
Ozzy Osbourne
----------------
Well she's a mean hard woman and she knows what she wants.  
She is my tattooed rock n roll dancer, I'm under her thumb  
And when she tells me come, ?oh hi? is the only way I can answer.  
  
They're gonna put me away, put me away, god damn them.  
  
Well I can hear her meaning like a dog that's in heat  
She never takes no for an answer, she's driving me mad,  
She makes it good to be bad, my little tattooed rock n roll dancer.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, god damn them.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, god soul's on fire.  
  
Tattooed dancer, dance for me bitch.  
  
I think I'm in grave danger, goin' over the top  
There is no question only an answer, she can't give me love  
I think I've fallen in lust with my tattooed rock n roll dancer.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, God damn them.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, God soul's on fire.  
  
They'll never put me away, God soul's on fire

Alter Mann (Old Man) English
Rammstein
----------------
He waits on the midday's wind  
The wave comes and lies down wearily  
With a fan every day  
The old one makes the water smooth  
  
I throw the stone for fun  
The water moves in circles  
The old one looks sadly at me  
And swept it smooth again  
  
In the white sand, the old man  
Trembling, smokes his pipe  
Only the water and I know  
Why he needs this fan  
  
The idea sleeps like a volcano  
Hesitating, I asked him then  
His head bent, it seemed he slept  
He said before he died  
  
The water shall be your mirror  
If it is smooth you will see  
How many fairy tales remain for you  
And you will plead for your redemption  
  
The fan pressed against his body  
The hand stiffens with rigor mortis  
They had to break his fingers  
The fan remains back in the sand  
  
I call the old one every day  
He would like to redeem me  
I remain back in the midday's wind  
And I can read in the fan  
  
The water shall be your mirror  
If it is smooth you will see  
How many fairy tales remain for you  
And you will plead for your redemption

Robot
Miley Cyrus
----------------
It's been like this from the start  
One piece after another to make my heart  
You mistake the game for being smart  
Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark  
But the sound of the steel  
And the crush and the grind  
It'll scream cause who am I to decide my life  
But in time it all dies  
There's nothing left inside  
Just rusted metal that was never even mine  
  
I would scream  
But I'm just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
God, set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey!  
Stop trying to live my life for me,  
I need to breathe  
I'm not your robot  
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine  
I'm breaking free  
Can't you see?  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
  
All this time,  
I've been misled  
There was nothing but crossed wires in my head  
I've been taught to think about what I feel  
Doesn't matter at all until you say it's real  
  
I would scream  
But I'm just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
Set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey!  
Stop trying to live my life for me,  
I need to breathe  
I'm not your robot  
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine  
I'm breaking free  
Can't you see?  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
I'm not your robot  
  
I would scream  
But I'm just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
Set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey!  
Stop trying to live my life for me,  
I need to breathe  
I'm not your robot  
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine  
I'm breaking free  
Can't you see?  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
I'm not your robot!

I Want You To Need Me
Celine Dion
----------------
I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes  
I want to be the touch you need every single night  
I want to be your fantasy  
And be your reality

Fool I've Been Today
Conway Twitty
----------------
God forgive me for the fool I've been today  
I just throw that girl you sent to me away  
Lord I'll bet you shook your head at those awful things I said  
When I let my foolish pride get in the way.  
  
And God forgive me for the man I fail to be  
To one who's only sin was loving me  
If I've got a right to pray after treating her this way  
God forgive me for the fool I've been today.  
  
Lord, I thought I'd die when that tear came in her eye  
And that look of disbelief came on her face  
What a shame she had to see the ugly side of me  
Just when my lonely heart had found it's place.  
  
God forgive me for the fool I've been today  
How much love can one man throw away  
I hadn't planned on growing old without that sweet and gentle soul  
God forgive me for the fool I've been today...

Upside Down
Zoegirl
----------------
Everybody's searching for something  
Something that they can call their own  
Wishing, hoping, waiting for empty skieds to open up  
But they don't  
What's up with all the obsession  
What's in and what's out  
That's what it's about  
Still we dream of better  
Fearing nothing's gonna ever be right, yeah  
All along, don't you know that you can't break free  
Take a look and see what's your reality  
[Chorus:]  
Upside down, spining round and round  
Happiness may not be what it seems  
Inside out, alone whithout a doubt  
Is your heart until he sats you free  
From all of this reality  
Oh, you know the world is so crazy  
It'll chew you up, spit you out  
Leave you feeling empty inside  
Filling your head with little white lies  
Jesus is the only reason that my heart is free to say  
You could dream a thousand dreams and have a million things  
But nothing could replace the love that jesus gave  
Talk shows, ecstasy, horoscopes, dvd's, pop culture, magazines, chat rooms,
MTV  
Protein diets, internet, the story isn't over yet, the psychic network really
cares?  
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?!!!!  
[Chorus]

Creepin' Up On You
Status Quo
----------------
I like the way you walk  
You got a giggle when you talk  
I like the way you talk  
You got a wiggle when you walk  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you.  
  
I'm gonna be your man  
You'd better understand  
Be your pretty little thing  
Your puppet on a string  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you  
  
Gonna write a little letter  
Poetry for two  
Send you pretty flowers  
Creepin' up on you  
  
Gonna write a little letter  
Poetry for two  
Send you pretty flowers  
  
Gonna take a little time  
Before I make you mine  
But I'll bet you anything  
You're gonna wear my ring  
Nothing you can do  
Sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you  
  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you  
  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you

One Day Too Long
Leann Rimes
----------------
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
one day to long  
  
I'm the kind of woman who understands  
How the road can be so hard on a traveling man  
I don't mind giving you a little room to breathe  
Then you go and take advantage of my generosity  
I'm home, waiting  
Alone, aching  
Your times run out cause  
Yesterday this love could have been saved  
Just crawl back out ain't no way  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long  
  
You know, I ain't a once in a while kind of thang  
You see, love is being here for each other  
Even with you standing right here, right now  
right in front of my face  
You're still looking right through me  
Well, let me clear something up for you honey  
  
I called you up  
Told you I was  
Missing, needing  
To be soothed by you  
Keep your reasons  
I'm done pleasing  
Ain't it funny now  
I'm leaving, and your the one who's being left behind  
God sent me a man who will give me my time  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long

Baby, It's Cold Outside
James Taylor
----------------
I really can't stay  
Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well Maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink  
No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay  
Baby don't hold out  
Ah, but it's cold outside  
  
C'mon baby  
  
I simply must go  
Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
Ooh baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been  
I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious  
Man, your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh your lips look delicious  
Well maybe just a half a drink more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home  
Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see  
How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay  
Get over that old out  
Ah, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr its cold  
It's cold out there  
Cant you stay awhile longer baby  
Well, I really shouldn't, alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ah, do that again

Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, (ring-a-ling) hear them ring (ting-a-ling)  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style

Blinkin' bright red and green

Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big day  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells,  
The corner Santa Claus is busy  
Silver bells  
Is busy now because  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, it fills the winter air  
Hear them ring, you hear it everywhere  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks (Silver bells)  
Dressed in holiday style (Silver bells)

Children laughing, people passing (Ring-a-ling)  
Meeting smile after smile (Hear them ring)  
Soon it will be Christmas day

I Got It Bad
Leann Rimes
----------------
Six a.m. came way to early  
But Friday means it's over soon  
Life gets boring in a hurry  
But I got somethin' that gets me goin'  
And I'm already gone  
  
I got it bad  
Feel that rumble  
tough and tumble under my feet  
I got it bad  
round and round, we've all gone mad  
Scream it - I got it bad  
  
I'm addicted to the fast life  
I cut my teeth on concrete dreams  
The rush of no control gets me high  
You know what I think  
too much of a bad thing  
Is exactly what I need  
  
I got it bad  
Feel that rumble  
tough and tumble under my feet  
I got it bad  
round and round, we've all gone mad  
Scream it - I got it bad  
  
Bad for speed and burnin' candles  
At both ends till I'm unraveled  
Bad for jumpin' off the edge  
Without a net because I can  
  
But I got somethin' that gets me goin'  
And I'm already gone  
  
I got it bad  
Feel that rumble  
tough and tumble under my feet  
I got it bad  
round and round, we've all gone mad  
Scream it - I got it bad

Alone Together
Carly Simon
----------------
Alone together, beyond the crowd  
Above the world, we're not too proud  
To cling together, we're strong  
As long as we're together  
  
Alone together, the blinding rain  
The starless night, were not in vain  
For we're together and what is there  
To fear together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather, the great unknown  
If we're alone together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather, the great unknown  
If we're alone together, together  
  
As long as your close to me  
Our love is as deep as a love can be  
As long as your close to me  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
  
As long as your close to me  
(Alone together)  
Our love is as deep as a love can be  
(Alone together)

Lana Del Rey
----------------
Heavy metal love of mine, I should have learned to let you stay  
You didn't want me all the time, but you were worth it anyway  
  
Cause you were so much better  
Than the rest of them  
Out of all the others  
You were the honest man  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
Motorcycle love divine  
I should have learned to let you play  
I wasn't the marrying kind  
I should have done it anyway  
We should have left Las Vegas and then began again  
To kill? Back to the promised land  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
I can feel it coming in the island tonight  
...
Turning tan in...  
I can see you bathing in the sun light  
You got game boy,  
Game boy, game boy  
You got game boy game boy,  
Game boy  
You got game  
  
He loved guns and roses,

And roses, roses, roses

Walk
Primus
----------------
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistance?  
One step away from lashing out at you...  
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend.  
I've got more friends like you  
What do I do?  
Is there no standard anymore?  
  
What it takes, who am I, where I've been, belong  
You can't be something you're not  
  
Be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me  
A lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of time  
  
Respect. Walk  
  
Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to acheive.  
You cry to weak friends that sympathize. Can you hear the  
Violins playing your song? Those same friens tell me your  
Every word  
  
Are you talking to me?  
  
No way punk!

I lay my life at your feet  
I surrender to You  
  
My life I lay down  
My heart and my soul  
Lord I surrender  
I give You my control  
  
God I give You every part of me  
Take my everything it's You that I seek  
All I want is to be where You are  
I'm Yours

Electric Love
Cinderella
----------------
When I was down  
An angel came to me  
And she touched me inside  
That woman set me free  
Turned on the light  
So I could see  
That there was fire inside  
And I could feel the heat  
  
She's got the power, she gets me high  
She can take a storm and make it shine  
She keeps the spark burning over time  
That woman's got electric love  
  
Ooo, electric love  
There ain't no medicine  
That makes me fly  
Like when I'm with my sweet woman  
She keeps me so satisfied  
And if we had no money  
We'd still get by  
And if the world should stop turnin'  
Our love would be alive  
  
She's got the power, she gets me high  
She can take a storm and make it shine  
She keeps the spark burning over time  
That woman's got electric love  
Look out  
  
She's got the power, she's gets me high  
She can take a storm and make it shine  
She keeps the spark burning over time  
That woman's got electric love  
  
Whoa yeah  
She gets me high, so high  
Ooo yeah, she makes the stars shine  
Burning all the time  
That woman's got electric love  
  
Electric love  
Electric love  
She's got the fire  
She's got the fire  
Electric love  
Electric love  
Electric love

Love This Life
Crowded House
----------------
Seal my fate  
I get your tongue in the mail  
No-one is wise  
Until they see how it lies  
Love this life  
Don't wait till the next one comes  
Pedal my faith  
The wheels are still turning round, turn round  
And maybe the day will come  
When you'll never have to feel no pain  
After all my complaining  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love this life  
And so they threw you in jail  
Whatever you've done  
It was a million to one  
And don't you just love this life  
When it's holding you down  
Pedal my faith  
The wheels are still turning round, turn round  
And maybe the day will come  
When you'll never have to feel no pain  
After all my complaining  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love this life  
There's something that you can do  
Even if you think that I hate you  
Stop your complaining, leave me defenseless  
When you love this life  
Gotta love this life  
Love this life though you'll never know why  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love

Naveed
Our Lady Peace
----------------
Are you there, and is it comfortable?  
Did you want to escape, try to escape the population?  
The pressure is deceiving,  
And for you particularly should we let a young man die?  
Let him die if he wants to?  
I can't live here anymore  
It's hard when you reach for that floor and  
And there's something that tears me inside, so I can't  
Go brother are you there?  
Now tell me is it wonderful  
Or were you hoping to find something a little more?  
Climbing down the hours I need to know now  
Do the hands of time only rule this chapter  
I'll have to try once again, I'll have to try when I want to  
There he's on his knees again  
Trying hard to understand  
Why Naveed would let a young man die  
Convinced that he might break he reaches for that phone  
And then another day has gone

The Voice
Roxette
----------------
Between the open heart and the whisper goodbye  
There's a perfect teardrop in your eye  
Between the lover's moon and the trembling sky  
There's a broken dream in your mind  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
  
Between the careful touch and the breakaway kiss  
There's a beauty you can't resist  
Mmm, between the fall apart and the moment of bliss  
There must be something more than this  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
In the dark  
Hear the lonely voice  
Hear the lonely voice  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
  
Oh, yea, the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark. In the dark  
Lonely voice. Lonely voice in the dark  
Hear the lonely voice  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark...

Love Lifted Me
Randy Travis
----------------
I was sinkin' deep in sin  
Far from the peaceful shore  
Very deeply stained within  
Sinking to rise no more.  
But the master of the sea  
Heard my despairing cry  
And from the waters lifted me  
Now safe am I.  
  
Love lifted me  
Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
Love lifted me  
Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
All my heart to him I give  
Ever to him I'll cling  
In his blessed presence live  
Ever his praises sing.  
  
Love so mighty and so true  
Merits my soul's best song  
Faithful, loving service too  
To him belongs  
  
Love lifted me  
Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
Love lifted me  
Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
Love lifted me

Guilty As Hell
Black Sabbath
----------------
Step back and look at you, and tell me that is what you want to be,  
You realise that what you're seeing, is a replica of me.  
Inside my world is pretty grim, that even I can't survive in,  
I wouldn't try 'cause I know you.  
  
Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell.  
Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell.  
  
You realise that what you're seeing is just a replica of me,  
Only me.  
  
Oh it makes no difference if you're the only one,  
It doesn't matter when all is said and done,  
Gonna feel the same, God will put the blame on you.  
Oh yeah.  
  
If I was you, If I was you,  
I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see inside my head,  
I'd wanna know if I was fuckin dead,  
I'd wanna know what's going on,  
Someone tell me the truth.  
  
There's no fear in a fallen Angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone,  
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming,  
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell.  
There's no fear in a fallen Angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone,  
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming.  
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell.  
You're guilty.

I'm Just A Name
Chuck Berry
----------------
Hello, I'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone  
Someone you won't remember of the many that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown  
I know I'm only someone else in love with you in vain  
I wish I could have helped myself, but love is so much pain  
It makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain  
That you will someday surely come and give me love again  
I knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you  
And I knew that these many nights I'd be alone and blue  
And lie awake while you forsake the only love I knew  
And never learn that you'll return and we would live it through  
Each time I dream a dream, I dream we're cuddled arm in arm  
It seems you're looking straight at me, when I see you perform  
Sometimes I think you see my face become so shy and warm  
I often wonder if you know the power in your charms  
Please, let me say I still love you before you hang the phone  
And I am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown

You looked me  
I smiled at you,  
You smiled at me  
And we're on our way,  
No we can't turn back, babe

Brand New
Pharrell Williams
----------------
My love, ooo  
My love  
  
A winner never quits  
And a quitter never wins  
I thought about what I wanted  
And you were on my list  
  
Remember where I was?  
In the desert with no love  
No cactus's, just dust  
And you swept me from above  
  
My love  
  
So I just wanna say  
Thank you for this day  
'Cause it is so good  
Good  
  
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new  
You got me feelin' brand new  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
So good morning, ooh girl  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
  
My love, ooo  
My love  
  
Life to me is easy  
People make it complicated  
When love is the tool  
No reason we can't make it  
  
Come on, let's go, be brave  
Feel somethin' at the [?]  
Once we know that amaze  
Then give it all the way  
  
My love  
  
So I just wanna say  
Thank you for this day  
'Cause it is so good  
Good  
  
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new  
You got me feelin' brand new  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
So good morning, ooh girl  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me, oh  
  
Listen, all my life, when I describe  
What I want, I've been misunderstood  
The more I try, at bein' satisfied  
And didn't think that I could  
But then you came along, and you made me strong  
Like God said you would  
  
So I just wanna say  
Thank you for this day  
'Cause it is so good  
Good  
  
Good  
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new  
You got me feelin' brand new  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
So good morning, ooh girl  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me

Everytime
Britney Spears
----------------
Notice me  
Take my hand  
Why are we  
Strangers when  
Our love is strong  
Why carry on without me  
  
Every time I try to fly I fall  
Without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And every time I see  
You in my dreams  
I see your face  
It's haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I make-believe  
That you are here  
It's the only way  
That I see clear  
What have I done  
You seem to move on easy  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time I try to fly I fall  
Without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And every time I see  
You in my dreams  
I see your face  
You're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I may have made it rain  
Please forgive me  
My weakness caused you pain  
And this song's my sorry  
  
At night I pray  
That soon your face will fade away  
  
[Chorus]

Still Falls The Rain
Alphaville
----------------
the rain against the windshield endlessly  
for many years i cruised around the world  
i've finally disembarked my ship of fools  
a hero then, a stranger to return  
i'd trade my goldrush 'gainst your silvernets  
to know what happened after all this time  
and in your arms i'm lost forevermore  
i wonder how you ever felt in mine  
isn't it strange, i still can hear your call  
isn't it strange, i'm not a ghost at all  
isn't it strange or is it just insane  
isn't it strange, the glory and the fame  
still falls the rain..  
do you remember how we used to play  
and how we waved our banners in the sun  
do you remember how we gave ourselves away  
for some strange kind of fun  
and how we smiled as if we'd understood the writings on the walls  
and cooked our spice on silver spoons  
and if we wouldn't see the light  
we overdosed the foll'wing night  
isn't it strange...  
i've got burnholes in my fingers that could not ease your pain  
or was it me who killed the blue inside your eyes?  
when silence grew behind our shadows on the wall  
but if all was silent, could we hear a bit more?  
i wonder can you hear me now? - isn't it strange  
ohhh...  
isn't it strange, i still can hear your call  
isn't it strange, i'm not a ghost at all  
isn't it strange or is it just insane  
isn't it strange, the glory and the fame  
still falls the rain..

Lucky Town
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
House got too crowded clothes got too tight  
And I don't know just where I'm going tonight  
Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain  
There's somebody callin' my secret name  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town  
Going down to Lucky Town  
I want to lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots  
But that coat always had a tread hangin' loose  
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise  
It led me right past your house and on over the rise  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town  
Down to Lucky Town  
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
I had some victory that was just failure in deceit  
Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet  
I been a long time walking on fortune's cane  
Tonight I'm steppin' lightly and feelin' no pain  
  
Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health  
Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves  
When it comes to luck you make your own  
Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home  
  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town

I came down to see you  
But you were never there  
You were always lonely somewhere  
I came down to love you  
But you were never there  
But you're always parting somewhere  
  
Hold on, don't leave me lonely  
Hold on, don't leave me lonely  
Hold on, don't go without me  
  
Tell me what's the game now  
Cause I'm feeling kind of jealous  
You're going out with friends now somewhere  
  
I'm gonna get my guitar  
And strum down all the pain  
I think I'm going crazy, beware  
  
Old on, don't ...  
I'm gonna let nobody, gonna let nobody love you  
Gonna let nobody love  
  
Thunder bloody bloody thunder  
Bloody thunder is on its way  
Thunder bloody bloody ...  
  
I came down to see you  
But you were never there  
You just left me lonely somewhere  
  
Hold on, don't ...  
  
I'm gonna le nobody, gonna let nobody love you  
Gonna let nobody love

Cry To Heaven
Meat Loaf

Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
Say a prayer and light a candle  
Toll a bell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
If that doesn't do it for you  
Go ahead, and cry like hell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
Storm the castle, stem the tide  
Rise above yourself  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
If that doesn't do it for you  
Go ahead, and cry like  
Go ahead, and cry like  
Go ahead, and cry like hell

A Horse In Town
Steely Dan
----------------
Left New Hyde Park  
to hold my own in New York Town  
Groped in the dark  
Until I faced a place where scallywags are found  
Sharks and yo-yos everywhere  
I think you can take it from there  
Now there's a horse in town  
I scream: Honey it's just a clown  
Yes there's a horse in town  
Saddle up and ride, ride, ride  
Can you reveal  
The day you came, the day you'll go  
This way I feel  
The time is moving much too slow  
And it passes by your chair  
If you laugh at my despair  
[Chorus]  
[Solo]  
The shoes of my friend  
They stamp the nail into the ground  
Let's not pretend  
We know we've all had fearsome style  
Following my frozen trail  
Moving to the inside rail  
[Chorus]

Drake

[Verse:]  
Word on road, it's the clique about to blow  
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know  
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low  
But it's cool, know you heard it all before  
  
[Hook:]  
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me  
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)  
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me  
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team  
Man these niggas got to stop it they be crowding up the scene  
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem  
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines  
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
It look like we in love, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies  
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires  
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me  
Before I'm on the next thing, ymcmb (ah)  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team  
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene  
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned  
She been going way to hard, someone has to intervene  
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
It might look like I care, but only on camera  
Only on camera, only on camera  
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies  
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all ties  
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, new kid with the crown  
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)  
  
[Outro:]  
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team (ay)  
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team (ay)

Manzanillo Bay
Arlo Guthrie
----------------
Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
And I can see a fisherman  
His day's catch Iying on the sand  
Underneath the palms that sway  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS:  
Now I'm missing your silver moon  
Black sands and your blue lagoon  
Some day I would like to be  
Back next to your shining sea  
Drinking rum from a conch shell  
Caught up in your magic spell  
Some day I would like to go  
Back down to Mexico  
I remember your fields of cane  
Your warm breezes and jungle rains  
And watching the children play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And out in your market square  
The women sing out to sell their wares  
I've got fresh shrimp today  
From Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
And under the spell of night  
The bay reflecting the harbor light  
You can hear the guitar play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And if you're thinking about romance  
And you're willing to take a chance  
Just pick any small cafe  
In Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay

If It Ain't One Thing It's Another
Randy Travis
----------------
I got up this morning tried to get off of work  
I couldn't even find not one clean shirt  
There was no hot water when I jumped in the shower  
I know my boss is gonna dock me an hour  
The older I get the more I discover  
If it ain't one thing it's another  
  
I got the car, I tried to get motivated  
Now I'm stuck in the traffic, all I'm doing is waiting  
The fool behind me keeps blowin' his horn  
I got my top laid back and it's coming up a storm  
The older I get the more I discover  
If it ain't one thing it's another  
  
Light bill phone bill water and gas  
Pay day comes and it goes so fast  
There's no way out and I'm telling you brother  
If it ain't one thing it's another  
  
I got to the job and I tried to explain  
The boss said you won't have to do that again  
I called home just to tell her the news  
She said bye bye baby I'm leaving you  
She took the kids and she's gone to her mother's  
If it ain't one thing, it's another  
  
Light bill phone bill water and gas  
Pay day comes and it goes so fast  
There's no way out and I'm telling you brother  
If it ain't one thing it's another  
If it ain't one thing it's another

Serial Killer
Lana Del Rey

Wish I may, wish I might,  
Find my one true love tonight.  
Do you think that he,  
Could be you?  
  
If I pray really tight,  
Get into a fake bar fight,  
While I'm walking down,  
The avenue.  
  
If I lay really quiet,  
I know that what I do isn't right,  
I can't stop what I,  
Love to do.  
  
So I murder love in the night,  
Watching them fall one by one they fight,  
Do you think you'll,  
Love me too, ooh, ooh?  
  
Baby, I'm a sociopath,  
Sweet serial killer.  
On the warpath,  
'Cause I love you,  
Just a little too much.  
  
I love you just,  
A little too much.  
(Much, much, much).  
  
You can see me,  
Drinking cherry cola,  
Sweet serial killer.  
I left a love note,  
Said you know I love,  
The thrill of the rush.  
  
You know I love,  
The thirll of the rush.  
(Rush, rush, rush).  
  
(You send me right to heaven),  
Sweet serial killer,  
(I guess I'll see him over).  
Do it for the thrill of the rush,  
Love you just a little too much, much.

Sweet serial killer,  
(I guess I'll see him over).  
I love you just a little too much,  
Love you just a little too much, much.

Maybe I'll go out tonight.  
We can paint the town,  
In blue.  
  
I'm so hot, I ignight,  
Dancing in the dark and I shine.  
Like a light I'm,  
Luring you.  
  
Sneak up on you, really quiet,  
Whisper "am I what your heart desires?"  
I could be your,  
Ingenue.  
  
Keep you safe, and inspired,  
Baby, let your fantasies unwind.  
We can do what you,  
Want to do, ooh, ooh.  
  
Baby, I'm a sociopath,  
Sweet serial killer.  
On the warpath,  
'Cause I love you,  
Just a little too much.  
  
I love you just,  
A little too much.  
(Much, much, much).  
  
You can see me,  
Drinking cherry cola,  
Sweet serial killer.  
I left a love note,  
Said you know I love,  
The thrill of the rush.  
  
You know I love,  
The thirll of the rush.  
(Rush, rush, rush).  
  
(You send me right to heaven),  
Sweet serial killer,  
(I guess I'll see him over).  
Do it for the thrill of the rush,  
Love you just a little too much, much.  
  
(You send me right to heaven),  
Sweet serial killer,  
(I guess I'll see him over).  
I love you just a little too much,  
Love you just a little too much, much.  
  
(Just have fun), wanna,  
Play you like a game boy.  
(Don't want one), what's,  
The thrill of the same toy?  
La la, la la la, la la,  
La la lie down, down.  
  
(Just have fun), wanna,  
Play you like a game boy.  
(Don't want one), what's,  
The thrill of the same toy?  
La la, la la la, la la,  
La la lie down, down, down.  
  
Ugh.  
  
You can see me,  
Drinking cherry cola,  
Sweet serial killer.  
I left a love note,  
Said you know I love,  
The thrill of the rush.  
  
You know I love,  
The thirll of the rush.  
(Rush, rush, rush).  
  
(You send me right to heaven),  
Sweet serial killer,  
(I guess I'll see him over).  
Do it for the thrill of the rush,  
Love you just a little too much, much.  
  
(You send me right to heaven),  
Sweet serial killer,  
(I guess I'll see him over).  
I love you just a little too much,  
Love you just a little too much, much.

Rosemary
Lenny Kravitz
----------------
Little Mary was five years old  
Her parents left her, she was out in the cold  
Alone to live and find her way  
In this great world of heartache and pain  
  
Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold  
Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled  
Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare  
Who could have left a child so rare  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm beggin you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
A burning heart and tired eyes  
Howling winds for lullabys  
No one there to soothe her fright  
Nowhere to turn but the inward light  
Because life is for believing  
That your heart can turn to gold  
All you need is Christ to receive it  
There's eternal life for every soul  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm begging you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
He loves you He needs you He wants you  
So don't let Him down

Get Off The Stage
Morrissey
----------------
Oh, you silly old man  
You silly old man  
You're making a fool of yourself  
So get off the stage  
  
You silly old man  
In your misguided trousers  
With your mascara and your Fender guitar  
And you think you can arouse us?  
  
But the song that you just sang  
It sounds exactly like the last one  
And the next one  
I bet you it will sound  
Like this one  
  
Downstage, and offstage  
Don't you feel all run in?  
And do you wonder when they will take it away?  
This is your final fling  
  
But then applause ran high  
But for the patience of the ones behind you  
As a verse drags on like a month drags on  
It's very short, but it seems very long  
  
And the song that you just sang  
It sounds exactly like the last one  
And the next one  
I bet you it will sound  
Like this one  
  
So, get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
And when we get down off of the stage  
Please stay off the stage - ALL DAY !  
  
Get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
And when we've had our money back  
Then I'd like your back in plaster  
  
Oh, I know that you say  
How age has no meaning  
Oh, but here is your audience now  
And they're screaming:  
  
"Get off the stage"  
Oh, get off the stage  
Because I've given you enough of my time  
And the money that wasn't even mine  
Have you seen yourself recently?  
  
Oh, get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
  
Get off the stage  
Get off the stage  
Get off the stage  
  
For whom the bell tolls

Finn:  
There is freedom within, there is freedom without  
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup

Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Winner At A Losing Game
Rascal Flatts
----------------
Baby, look here at me  
Have you ever seen me this way  
I've been fumblin' for words  
Through the tears and the hurt and the pain  
I'm gonna lay it all out  
On the line tonight  
And I think that it's time  
To tell this uphill fight goodbye  
  
[Chorus:]  
Have ever had to love someone  
That just don't feel the same  
Tryin' to make somebody care for you  
The way I do  
Is like tryin' to catch the rain  
And if love is really forever  
I'm a winner at a losin' game  
  
I know that baby, you tried  
To find me somewhere inside of you  
But you know you can't lie  
Girl, you can't hide the truth  
Sometimes two hearts  
Just can't dance to the same beat  
So I'll pack up my things  
And I'll take what remains of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know that I'll never be the man that you need or love  
Yeah, baby it's killin' me to stand here and see  
I'm not what you've been dreamin' of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, if love is really forever  
I'm a winner at a losin' game  
Ooo, I'm tired of losing  
Oh, oh, oh

Cross The Line
John Legend
----------------
Only just a friend,  
The love story begins,  
Now here's a happy ending to believe in.  
And always there for me,  
Now you're with me in my dreams  
It's got me wondering if you ever,  
Dream of me.  
I don't wanna risk losing everything.  
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking.  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl, you'll be my best friend,  
Can we put this to bed then?  
Tonight's the night  
To cross the line  
Baby won't you be mine?  
Not just my home girl  
Time that I take you home girl  
Tonight's the night  
To cross the line  
Let me love you tonight.  
I, I, I  
  
Kiss, kiss, kiss me on my lips  
We've been dancing 'round the moment  
Now we're doing it.  
Breathe, breathe.  
And sigh your sweet relief  
We've been holding it so long,  
The wait was killing me.  
Oh and we, are what we, have been waiting for.  
So baby, open your mind, while I close the door.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't let this moment just slip away.  
Cause we'll never know, unless we try someday  
If you're ready, I'm so ready  
Tonight's the night  
Tonight's the night.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Luther Vandross
----------------
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on, our troubles will be miles away  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
  
From now on, our troubles will be miles away  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

House We've Been Calling Home
David Allan Coe
----------------
Jessie she stares like a cat with a bird  
That has fallen and broke its wing  
Terri she puts on her make-up  
And wonders what promise the new day will bring  
  
Debbie stays home with the baby  
While I work my hands to the bone  
Yeah I make a living they do the giving  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Jessie's the youngest she always needs  
Answers to questions that I just don't know  
Terri she can't sit still for a moment  
She's always in some hurry to go  
  
Debbie's been with me the longest  
We spend most of our time on the phone  
Talking in rhymes with no reasons in mind  
For this house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home

Lullaby
Noa
----------------
Sleep little baby don't you fret  
Mamma's going to say a little prayer  
Then mamma's going to get some masking tape  
To fix the hole in the ozone layer  
  
Sleep little angel, baby dove  
Sun's gone down, it's getting late  
Mamma's got her chicken soup of love  
For the bad old world is sick with hate  
  
Wish that I could give you child  
All the beauty I have seen  
Mamma's going to sing you a melody  
That you can hum when you're alone  
  
Now you're in your cozy bed  
Sleep little angel, drop of mud  
There's a journey in your head  
And desert winds blow in your blood  
  
Wicked wold and wicked world  
Howling in the moonless sky  
But mamma's here to fend them off  
Hush little baby, don't you cry

One Of The Survivors
Kinks
----------------
See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike  
Riding along the highway,  
Rock and roll songs from the nineteen-fifties  
Buzzing around in his brain.  
Johnny Thunder he's one of the original bebop generation  
And he's got no time for complicated music  
Or too much sophistication.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The motorbike riders.  
You ought to see Johnny Thunder  
Riding down the highway  
One of the rock and roll survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain.  
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
And Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He plays Hound Dog, Oh Boy,  
And Great Balls of Fire  
And Boppin' At The High School Hop.  
And he's got no time for phonies or posers  
Cause they don't know how to reel and rock.  
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo,  
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes,  
The Hollywood Argyles, Danny and The Juniors,  
Dion and The Belmonts, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The boppers and the jivers,  
Yeah and he rocks all day.  
Johnny and The Hurricanes, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
Got my freedom riding along the freeway.  
I ride a hundred miles an hour  
But I don't mess up my D.A.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
  
Feel those vibrations flow in my brain.  
Got my freedom riding down the highway,  
Keeps me sane, feel alive,  
I'm one of the survivors.  
  
Feel all right.  
First gear, second gear,  
Third gear, fourth gear, all right.  
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight,  
And his sideburns are turning grey.  
But he still likes to bebop, boogie and jive  
To his worn out seventy-eights.  
Johnny Thunder.  
He's alright.  
He's one of the survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain,  
Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes.

You're The One
Carpenters
----------------
Ev'ry night, ev'ry day  
You're the one I always dream of  
Ev'ry line of your face  
Is sketched so plain inside my heart  
You've grown so deep inside of me  
You're everything I feel and see  
And you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
All my life, all my love  
I can feel when you're beside me  
All that's right, all that's wrong  
Suddenly becomes so clear  
My heart has overtaken me  
With feelings you awake in me  
And you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
Only you could move me enough to believe in love one more time  
All I need to know for tomorrow is that you're mine  
Mine for a lifetime  
  
If our friends all around  
Find it hard to understand us  
You and I understand the other one so very well  
And that's what I've been looking for  
So I keep coming back for more  
'Cause you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
You're the one, you're the one I love

Between The River And Me
Tim McGraw
----------------
I was fifteen when my daddy died  
Mama worked two jobs just to get by  
Seemed like a blessing when Harley came around  
So she took his name, but I had my doubts  
Didn't take long for his drinking ways to start showing up on mama's face  
One violent night, hiding under my bed  
I swore that he wouldn't see another sunset  
Next day I followed him down to the riverbank  
I knew one of us wouldn't walk away  
  
I might have had a plan, but he didn't know it  
I might have been scared, but I didn't show it  
That's all between the river and me  
With the current and the rocks it could have been misty  
He might have been sober, but I brought the whiskey  
That's all between the river and me  
  
I walked up to him, and I said his name  
Just so he could see the look on my face  
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe  
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home  
He raised his fist to me, but I didn't flinch  
I said, "I ain't your son, you son of a bitch."  
  
I might have had a knife in my back pocket  
I might have pulled it out before he saw it  
That's all between the river and me  
I might have had a gun, but I didn't fire it  
He might have tried to yell, but I kept him quiet  
That's all between the river and me  
That's all between the river and me  
  
Sheriff came knocking on our front door  
They said they found his body by the reservoir  
Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood  
He must have fallen in the river and he never came up  
  
There might have been blood, but they never saw it  
Just a little mud on the living room carpet  
That's all between the river and me  
Well, after what he done, there ain't no wonder  
I can't remember how long I held him under  
That's all between the river and me  
That's all between the river and me  
That's all between the river and me  
That's all  
That's all

Just Another Woman
Air Supply
----------------
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man  
  
Knock upon my window  
Late at night making me believe  
that something's not right  
I look through the window but all I can see  
Is the rain  
Standing on my doorstep  
Not very old looking so helpless  
And looking so cold  
A woman in need of some help  
Most have lost her way  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man  
  
As we sat by the fire  
The flame just grew  
Talking about just the things we knew  
Watching a new day arise outside my room  
The more I listened the more she told  
And in fascination my heart was sold  
Weaving in and out of my mind  
With a skidder off now  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man

Memphis, Tenessee
The Beatles
----------------
Long distance information  
Give me Memphis, Tennessee  
Try to find the party  
Trying to get in touch with me  
She would not leave her number  
But I know who placed the call  
Cos my uncle took the message  
And he wrote it on the wall  
  
Help me, information  
Get in touch with my Marie  
She's the only one who'd phone me here  
From Memphis, Tennessee  
Her home is on the south side  
Just beyond the ridge  
Just a half a mile  
From the Mississippi Bridge  
  
Help me, information  
More than that I cannot add  
Only that I miss her  
And all the fun we had  
We were pulled apart  
Because her mom would not agree  
Help me get in touch with her  
In Memphis, Tennessee  
  
The last time I saw Marie  
She was waving me goodbye  
With hurry homedrops on her cheek  
That trickled from her eyes  
Marie is only six years old  
Information please  
Help me get in touch with her  
In Memphis, Tennessee

If I...
Modern Talking
----------------
All friends are gone, my heart, it burns like fire  
When the night comes falling, falling from the sky  
I was so wrong, how could I loose my desire  
How many times can we say goodbye  
Love is a sacrifice  
You have to head between the lies  
  
[Chorus: ]  
If I'll never see the sun again  
If I'll never have your helping hand  
If I'll never see a children smile  
My would is lost  
If we don't try  
  
I'm so alone - I cannot stand it forever  
Sometimes I feel, like I can't stand the pain  
All that I want, we can't do it together  
Only with you, I feel like I'm born again  
No matter what I do  
I do it baby just for you  
  
[Chorus: ]

The Prodigal Son Suite
Keith Green
----------------
I was done hoeing, out in the fields for the day,  
I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,  
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,  
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.  
  
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,  
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,  
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,  
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.  
  
I said, father, there's so much to know,  
There's a world of things to see,  
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself  
If you give me what is mine,  
I will go, if I can have your blessing,  
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.  
Son, I've always tried my best for you,  
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of God.  
  
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,  
I met a travelling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,  
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,  
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,  
He said, no, it isn't that bad.  
And then a few days later, on an old city road,  
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,  
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,  
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.  
  
Then a famine hit and drained the land,  
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was so hard to find,  
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,  
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.  
I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,  
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,  
I had to eat with the swine,  
The bread I ate was like stone,  
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.  
Oh, the servants there are better fed,  
If I could only have what my father gives them,  
I would truly need nothing more.  
Oh, I will go and say to him,  
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,  
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them.  
  
It didn't take too long to pack my things,  
I left with only what I wore,  
As I prayed that I still had a home.  
I was near home, in site of the house,  
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,  
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,  
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,  
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,  
I've learned that my home is right where you are,  
Oh father, take me in.  
Bring the best robe, put it on my son,  
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,  
This is my son who I thought had died,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,  
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,  
My son was dead and he's now alive,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
My son was dead,  
My son was lost,  
My son's returned in the hands of God.

One Fine Day
Robbie Williams
----------------
I like to reminisce about a time I've never had  
A book that no-one read  
A film that never made me sad  
And you remind of a place I've never been  
  
And something no-one said  
When I was 17  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
  
You'll wake up in it  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably won't admit it  
  
Remember when we never struggled through?  
A bad time we never had  
A love we never fell into  
Please don't remind me to forget  
  
'Cause forgiveness is a place  
I ain't got used to yet  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
  
You'll wake up in it  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably won't admit it  
  
All I ever wanted  
Was to radiate your home  
But I guess it doesn't matter  
So come reminisce about a time we didn't have  
  
I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad  
Don't rewrite my history  
'Cause you never really know  
How much you didn't mean to me  
  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
You'll wake up in it  
One fine day  
  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably won't admit it

I Never Will Marry
Linda Ronstadt
----------------
Never, never will I marry  
Never, never will I wed  
Born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed, never  
Never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
No conscious, no care, no burdens to bear  
No memories to mourn, no turning  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed  
Never, never, never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed  
Never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
Never, never

Clones (We're All)
Alice Cooper
----------------
I'm a clone  
I know it and I'm fine  
I'm one and more are on the way  
I'm two, doctor  
Three's on the line  
He'll take incubation another day  
CHORUS: I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroying time  
No more problems on the way  
  
REFRAIN: I'm through doctor  
We don't need your kind  
The other ones  
Ugly ones  
Stupid boys  
Wrong ones  
CHORUS  
Six is having problems  
Adjusting to his clone status  
Have to put him on a shelf  
(Please don't put me on the shelf)  
All day long we hear him crying so loud  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
Be myself  
Be myself  
  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroyed time  
No more problems on the way  
REFRAIN  
CHORUS  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all

Better Change
Dan Fogelberg
----------------
I can see you in the distance  
And you're heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
You're about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
There's an angel on your shoulder  
And a devil at your feet  
And that door you see before you  
Could be poison tasting sweet.  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
I can see you in the distance  
And you're heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
You're about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
You gotta tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
You better tear them down.  
Tear them down!

Colorblind
Counting Crows
----------------
I am colorblind  
Coffee black and egg white  
Pull me out from inside  
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready,  
I am taffy stuck and tongue tied  
Stutter shook and uptight  
Pull me out from inside  
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready,  
I am fine  
  
I am covered in skin  
No one gets to come in  
Pull me out from inside  
I am folded and unfolded and unfolding  
I am colorblind  
Coffee black and egg white  
Pull me out from inside  
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready,  
I am fine  
I am fine  
I am fine

The Things I Used To Do
Chuck Berry
----------------
Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
  
Used to sit and hold your hand, baby  
Begging you, not today  
  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Yeah, and I'm new alone again, darlin'  
You was out somewhere with your other man  
  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
  
Nothing I ever do pleases you, darlin'  
Or I just can't get along with you

Hold My Hand
Kinks
----------------
Today, when she comes in,  
I'll be standing at the door, and I won't say any more.  
I know that she's been there.  
It's not the way I look at her, it's the way she looks at me.  
Yes you can hold my hand any other night,  
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.  
Hold my hand any other night of the week,  
Todo está bien.
Hold my hand any other night,  
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.  
Hold my hand any other night of the week,  
Todo está bien.
Hold my hand.  
Hold my hand.  
Hold my hand.  
When she lays on my bed,  
It's not me she's thinking of, it's just me that really cares.  
My time, I know is out,  
And she'll be walking through that door,  
And she'll lie again tomorrow night.  
Yes you can hold my hand any other night,  
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.  
Hold my hand any other night of the week,  
Todo está bien.
Hold my hand any other night,  
Hold my hand, it's gonna be all right.  
Hold my hand any other night of the week,  
Todo está bien.
Hold my hand.  
Hold my hand.  
Hold my hand.  
Hold my hand.

Animal Instinct
Elvis Presley
----------------
Don't ever take tour eyes off me  
Not even for a minute  
'Cause like a panther I might pounce  
And that will be the limit  
  
I can be sneaky, fast as a snake  
I strike like a cobra, make no mistake  
And baby you'll be trapped, quick as a wink  
It's animal instinct  
  
Don't think that I won't pin you down  
No matter how you plead it  
I'm like a lion who's been caged  
And you are gonna meet it  
  
Watch out I'll warn ya', sharp as a hawk  
I'm wild as a tiger, I prowl and I stalk  
'cause when a man feels thirst, he takes a drink  
It's animal instinct  
  
You better not be caught off guard  
This wolf is on the search now  
A leopard just can't change it's spots  
And I'm about to lurch now  
I roar like the jungle, I fight tooth and nail  
I just gotta get you, you'll fall without fail  
I'm ready for the kill, I'm right on the brink  
It's animal instinct  
It's animal instinct, animal instinct

Powerslave
Iron Maiden
----------------
Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus  
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go  
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple  
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why I had to be a power slave  
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?  
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.  
And in my last hour,  
I'm a slave to the power of death.  
  
When I was living this lie-fear was my game  
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees  
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me  
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,  
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone  
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages  
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.  
  
[Chorus]

Wake Me Up
Zebrahead
----------------
I want a wrecking ball  
I want to break it all  
I want to jump the track  
Fade the day to black  
It's in the elements  
In the elements  
Is what they meant  
And the world is bent  
  
Give me something to believe in  
A drop of hope to raise our fists up high  
Blood fills our lungs from screaming  
We won't live a lie  
won't live a lie  
This life is but a dream!  
  
[Chorus]  
So wake me up  
Cause I must be dreaming  
I can't believe what my eyes are seeing  
Yeah wake me up  
I can't find a meaning  
Nothing really matters when  
the world is sinking  
Down, down. abajo
When it all falls  
Down, down, down  
Who will you blame?  
  
I want to be what I'm not  
I want to care a lot  
I want to stop your fall  
I want to take it all  
It's never Heaven sent  
Never heaven sent  
And what they meant  
never made a dent  
Give me something to believe in  
A drop of hope to raise our fists up high  
Blood fills our lungs from screaming  
We won't live a lie  
won't live a lie  
This life is but a dream.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trust is breached  
We're misunderstood  
We try to find our way  
But we're falling down  
Nothing to hold on to  
No one there to catch you  
And I could never lie to you  
  
I said we're fucking falling down  
Nothing to hold to  
No one there to catch you  
And I know you'd never lie  
Give us something to believe in  
This life is not a dream!  
  
[Chorus]

Come Take A Trip In My Airship
Johnny Cash
----------------
And she spread her wings and she flew  
Yup, the nation was flying now  
Taken to the air, in few hours time you could fly over  
All those trails blazed by the pioneers  
  
Phonographs were playing the hit songs of the day  
Alexanders ragtime band  
My mother was a lady and here's a song my mama sing  
Back about 1910 or 1915  
  
Come take a trip in my airship  
Come take a trip round the stars  
Come take a sail around Venus  
Come take a sail around Mars  
  
No one to watch while we're kissin'  
No one to see while we spoon  
Come take a trip in my airship  
We'll visit the man in the moon

I Ran All The Way Home
Dean Martin
----------------
I ran all the way home  
Just to tell you that I'm sorry  
I really didn't mean to be  
So mean to you  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to hold you in my arms dear  
I always want you near to me  
'Cause I love you  
  
The moment I closed the door behind me  
And I heard you cry  
I knew I acted blindly  
That I couldn't say good bye  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to hold you in my arms dear  
I always want you near to me  
'Cause I love you  
  
The moment I closed the door behind me  
And I heard you cry  
I knew I acted blindly  
That I couldn't say good bye  
  
I ran all the way home  
Just to beg you to forgive me  
I want your love to be my own  
Just mine alone

Winter Wonderland
Faith Hill
----------------
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away, is the bluebird  
Here to stay, is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids come knock him down  
  
When it's cold, ain't it thrilling  
When your nose, gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland

I've Been Missing You
UB40
----------------
It's not because I've just been caught  
It's not as if I planned this  
I didn't give a single thought  
One big misunderstanding  
I see how things look from your side  
I see how you're hurting  
The reason that I didn't hide  
One big misunderstanding  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
It's too late for sorry, this much is true  
I did what I did  
Just to make my way through  
One more day far away from you  
And I've been missing you  
  
It's not the first won't be the last time  
I've been caught red-handed  
To tell the truth I cannot lie  
One big misunderstanding  
I haven't got an alibi  
And I can't stop them talking  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
One big misunderstanding  
  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
For the things that I did I'm saying sorry to you  
But I did what I did and I paid my dues  
I've been missing you  
  
It's not the first won't be the last time  
I've been caught red-handed  
To tell the truth I cannot lie  
One big misunderstanding  
I haven't got an alibi  
And I can't stop them talking  
I cross my heart and hope to die  
One big misunderstanding  
  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
For the things that I did I'm saying sorry to you  
But I did what I did and I paid my dues  
I've been missing you

Talented with your lips, like you blew out candles

Take Me On And On
Electric Light Orchestra

The stars that shine so brightly  
They call to me  
I dream of how it might be  
Somewhere far away  
  
Take me on and on  
Until the world has gone  
Take me on and on  
  
The chains that hold you  
Those chains will soon be gone  
Sail upon the ocean  
Sail back to me  
  
Take me on and on  
Until the world has gone  
Take me on and on  
  
Take me on, on and on  
I see it all below  
I know which way to go  
I see the afterglow  
  
Take me on and on  
Until the world has gone  
Take me on and on

But more than you can take  
Under those dark glasses  
Baby eyes of a snake  
Her swagger is sexy  
So wrong but so right  
And though the venom is deadly  
Still you beg for the bite  
  
Everybody wanna touch it  
Touch it  
And they give up preserve  
She can make you love it

Do it 'cause I said so  
You're under my control  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Just keep on loving me  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
She said don't ask no questions  
Do it 'cause I said so  
You're under my control  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Just keep on loving me  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Just keep on lovin' me  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so

Can't Stop
Red Hot Chili Peppers
----------------
Can't stop addicted to the shindig  
Cop top he says I'm gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for  
This punk the feeling that you stay for  
In time I want to be your best friend  
East side love is living on the west end  
Knock out but boy you better come to  
Don't die you know the truth is some do  
Go write your message on the pavement  
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant  
White heat is screaming in the jungle  
Complete the motion if you stumble  
Go ask the dust for any answers  
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers  
  
[Chorus]  
The world I love  
The tears I drop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Ever wonder if it's all for you  
The world I love  
The trains I hop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Come and tell me when it's time to  
  
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone  
So smart she's leading me to ozone  
Music the great communicator  
Use two sticks to make it in the nature  
I'll get you into penetration  
The gender of a generation  
The birth of every other nation  
Worth your weight the gold of meditation  
This chapter's going to be a close one  
Smoke rings I know your going to blow one  
All on a spaceship persevering  
Use my hands for everything but steering  
Can't stop the spirits when they need you  
Mop tops are happy when they feed you  
J. Butterfly is in the treetop  
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop  
  
The world I love  
The tears I drop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Ever wonder if it's all for you  
The world I love  
The trains I hop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Come and tell me when it's time to  
  
Wait a minute I'm passing out  
Win or lose just like you  
Far more shocking  
Than anything I ever knew  
How about you  
Ten more reasons  
Why I need somebody new just like you  
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew  
Right on cue  
  
Can't stop addicted to the shindig  
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for  
This punk the feeling that you stay for  
In time I want to be your best friend  
East side love is living on the west end  
Knock out but boy you better come to  
Don't die you know the truth is some do  
Go write your message on the pavement  
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant  
  
Kick start the golden generator  
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her  
Can't stop the gods from engineering  
Feel no need for any interfering  
Your image in the dictionary  
This life is more than ordinary  
Can I get two maybe even three of these  
Coming from space  
To teach you of the pliedes  
Can't stop the spirits when they need you  
This life is more than just a read through

Everything Happens For The Best
Billie Holiday
----------------
Always blue all in a mist  
It's plain as can be  
You're so mean to me  
But everything happens for the best  
You always play around  
You're running my heart so deep in the ground  
That O.K. everything happens for the best  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best  
  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best

I Don't Know How To Tell Him
Wanda Jackson
----------------
I can tell him his toy gun won't kill Indians  
And the towel around his neck don't make him strong  
I can tell him there's no Easter bunny  
But I don't know how to tell him that you're gone  
He still looks for you every morning he's cried every night we've been alone  
I can tell him there's no real Santa but I don't know how to tell him that
te has ido
  
I can tell him his broomstick's not a pony  
And wearin' daddy's boots don't make him grown  
I can tell him there's no to ferry  
But I don't know how to tell him that you're gone  
Cause he still looks for you...  
I don't know how to tell him that you're gone

Prove It To You One More Time Again
Kris Kristofferson
----------------
Nobody's blamin' you.  
Don't get me wrong.  
I know so many things you done for me.  
But you got your life that you gotta live  
And I'll get along.  
I just wonder who you wanted me to be.  
And I just can't believe that you still don't believe in me  
Or hold a clue to who I am.  
I just hope to God that I still got the heart to take it  
And prove it to you one more time again.  
So many lies we've told so many times  
Maybe it's too late to make it love again  
If we got a choice then we gotta chance  
We gotta try  
And do the story true right to the end.  
And I can't believe that you still don't believe in me  
And you still don't understand me  
I just hope to God that I still got the heart to take it  
And prove it to you one more time again.

You And I
Enrique Iglesias
----------------
You and I  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
All I need is your hand  
And your heart  
  
Let's be free  
Run away from it all  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Here we are  
Face to face  
One more time  
  
In the light  
In the dark  
We will shine  
  
There's nobody, we're alone-lone-lone  
Take all of your worries, let them go, let them go  
I'll bring you to a place that only we know tonight  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
aquí estamos
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Oh, we go higher baby  
Oh, we go higher baby

Theres Something There
Beauty And The Beast
----------------
Belle:  
There's something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean  
And he was course  
And unrefined  
And now he's dear  
And so I'm sure  
I wonder why I didn't see it there before  
  
Beast:  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched  
She didn't shudder at my paw  
No it can't be  
I'll just ignore  
But then she's never looked at me that way before  
  
Belle:  
New and a bit alarming  
Who'd have ever thought that this could be  
True that he's no prince charming  
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see  
  
Lumiere:  
Well who'd have thought  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well who'd have known  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well who indeed  
  
Lumiere:  
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own  
  
Ms. Potts:  
It's so peculiar  
  
Ms. Potts, cogsworth, lumiere  
We'll wait and see a few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before  
  
Ms. Potts:  
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Black
Pearl Jam
----------------
Hey, oh  
Sheets of empty canvas  
Untouched sheets of clay  
Were laid spread out before me  
As her body once did  
All five horizons  
Revolved around her soul  
As the earth to the sun  
Now the air I tasted and breathed  
Has taken a turn  
  
Oh and all I taught her was everything  
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore  
And now my bitter hands  
Chafe beneath the clouds  
Of what was everything  
Oh the pictures have  
All been washed in black  
Tattooed everything  
I take a walk outside  
I'm surrounded by  
Some kids at play  
I can feel their laughter  
So why do I sear  
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin  
Round my head  
I'm spinning  
Oh, I'm spinning  
How quick the sun can, drop away  
  
And now my bitter hands  
Cradle broken glass  
Of what was everything  
All the pictures had  
All been washed in black  
Tattooed everything  
All the love gone bad  
Turned my world to black  
Tattooed all I see  
All that I am  
All I'll be  
  
Yeah  
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life  
I know you'll be a star  
In somebody else's sky  
But why  
Why  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be mine

Perforation Problems
Iggy Pop
----------------
I got a secret you can live and learn  
I got a secret you can live and learn  
You don 't know me but I burn  
You don 't know me but I burn  
  
Deep in your gut you know  
The right way out  
Deep in your gut you know  
Not like those guys who mess around  
Not like those guys who fake it, now  
Perforation problems not all right  
Hanging on a needle out of spite  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
In anger  
  
I got a worm down in my troubled soul  
I got a worm down in my troubled soul  
Now I 'm all right but there's still holes  
Now I 'm all right but there's still holes  
  
Every time I think it was my last  
Every time I hoped it was my last  
I watched my future become my past  
I watched my future become my past  
Perforation problems not all right  
  
Hanging on a needle outta fright  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
In anger  
  
I still get angry when I look back  
I still get angry when I look back  
When I look ahead my bags are packed  
Perforation problems not all right  
Hanging on a needle out of fright  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
  
Perforation problems not all right  
Perforation problems every night  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
Perforation problems  
Fright

Story Of Us
Taylor Swift
----------------
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us  
How we met and the sparks flew instantly  
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"  
  
I used to know my place was a spot next to you  
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat  
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on  
  
Oh, a simple complication  
Miscommunications lead to fall out  
So many things that I wish you knew  
So many walls up I can't break through  
  
Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room  
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate  
When it all broke down and the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter  
  
How'd we end up this way?  
See me nervously pulling at my clothes  
And trying to look busy  
And you're doing your best to avoid me  
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us  
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here  
But you held your pride like you should have held me  
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending  
Why are we pretending this is nothing?  
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how  
I've never heard silence quite this loud  
  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate  
When it all broke down and the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
This is looking like a contest  
Of who can act like they care less  
But I liked it better when you were on my side  
The battle's in your hands now  
But I would lay my armor down  
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight  
So many things that you wish I knew  
But the story of us might be ending soon  
  
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room  
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate  
When it all broke down and the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end

The Pillow
UB40
----------------
A smile for every passing car  
And when they stop with door ajar  
She shrugs and whispers que sera  
And turns her thoughts to the pillow  
Her face is etched with memories  
She finds now joy amid the sleaze  
It's hard when you've been paid to please  
So she turns her thoughts to the pillow  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight comes she rests her head  
The beauty of an empty bed  
She dreams of happy days instead  
Of brooding on to-morrow  
  
She swapped her dreams of shining knights  
For pushers, bars and money fights  
For nameless faces in red light  
So she turns her head to the pillow  
Those black eyes don't hurt any more  
She's heard the jokes and jibes before  
She's felt the long arm of the law  
So she turns her head to the pillow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Taking drugs was not for fun  
It made her feel like going on  
But now she hurts when its all gone  
And she turns her head to the pillow  
She take a blade and breaks her skin  
Sweet life force flows from within  
The white clouds in her head grow dim  
And she turns her head to the pillow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sunlight creeps across her head  
Pale beauty in a crimson bed  
No dreams of happy days ahead  
She'll have no more tomorrows

Pamela
Toto
----------------
Side by side, I'll be yours forever  
Rain or shine, any kind of weather  
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you  
Let's take what's getting old and make it new  
  
Oh, eye to eye, it's a blinding confrontation  
You and I, we're a deadly combination  
So don't start mixing truth with jealousy  
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
Black and white always go together  
Day and night you're the precious jewel I treasure  
Wanting every part of you is not a crime  
Or could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
All that I love (all that I love)  
Thousands of miles away, but always in my heart  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind

The Test That Stumped Them All
Dream Theater
----------------
Standing in the darkness  
Waiting for the light  
The smell of pure adrenaline  
Burning in the night  
  
Random blinding flashes  
Aiming at the stage  
Intro tape begins to roll  
Igniting sonic rage  
  
Still they keep me between these hollow walls  
Hoping to find in me  
The answers to the test that stumped them all  
  
"The boy is just simply crazy  
Suffering from delusions  
We honestly think that maybe  
He might need an institution  
  
He lives in a world of fiction  
And really could use some help  
We have just the place to fix him  
To save him from himself"  
  
Curled up in the darkness  
Searching of the light  
The smell of sweat and shit  
Steaming through the night  
  
Random urine testing  
Pills red, pink and blue  
Counseling and therapy  
Providing not a clue  
  
Still they keep me between these hollow walls  
Hoping to find in me  
The answers to the test that stumped them all  
  
"We can't seem to find the answers  
He seemed such a clear cut case  
We cannot just let him leave here  
And put all this work to waste  
  
Why don't we try shock treatment  
It really might do some help  
We have just the tools to fix him  
To save him from himself"

Lochness
Judas Priest
----------------
Grey mist drifts upon the water  
The mirrored surface moves  
Awakened of this presence  
Dispelling legends proof  
  
A beastly head of onyx  
With eyes set coals of fire  
It's leathered hide glides glistening  
Ascends the heathered briar  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternities  
On and on and on  
  
Loch Ness confess  
Your terror of the deep  
Loch Ness distress  
Malingers what you keep  
Loch Ness protects monstrosity  
Loch Ness confess to me  
  
Somehow it heeds the piper  
From battlements that call  
From side to side it ponders  
In passion in the skirl  
  
This highland lair of mystery  
Retains a lost world empathy  
Resilient to discovery  
On and on and on  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternity  
Your secret lies safe with me  
  
This creature's peril from decease  
Implores to mankind for release  
A legacy to rest in peace  
On and on and on

Next Man
Everlast
----------------
Aha  
'And there, but for the grace of God, go I'  
It's kinda neat  
I wonder what it means  
  
I rock a jam for love  
I quit my band for love  
I'll smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love  
Make you cry like a dove  
Leave you standin' alone  
In a world so cold  
Watch the drama unfold  
'Cause you sell your soul  
Now you're fearin' your death  
Sniffin' crystal meth 'till there ain't none left  
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it  
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted  
You probably won't admit it  
So you start to sink lower  
You're caught in the flood  
And you're tryin' to find Noah  
If you hungry and your near me yo, you gonna get fed  
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay your head  
Then come take my bed  
I'll sleep on the floor  
'Cause these are the times that friends are for  
  
Chorus (X2)  
I see everybody out here doin' for self  
And they don't give a damn on the next man  
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health  
I can't wait 'till you the next man  
  
I get uptight for love  
You know I'll fight for love  
I might keep my wifey up all night for love  
And when the daylight comes  
I be seein' mad bums  
With no shoes on their feet  
Plus nothin' to eat  
I can't save the whole street  
So I feel like I'm beat  
And why play the game when nothin' goin' to change  
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans  
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend  
Tryin' to keep my dean  
I try to give to the poor  
Tryin' to get through this life  
And get through that door  
I'm all up in this mix  
For these final tics  
Goin' all the way to seven  
And it's half past six  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
I pray to God for love  
I'll make Jihad for love  
And I just might pull your freakin' card for love  
Make you sing 'Hey Love' like my man King Son  
I freak the art noise  
Over all you toys  
Better bring your boys  
Summon all your crew  
No matter what you do  
It's comin' back on you  
Just like a planet orbits  
Let your sponge absorb it  
It's logical conclusion  
It's b-boy fusion  
And confusion say that he want control  
Of your mentality  
Your body and your soul  
So if you lose your whole  
Come and take my hand  
And link up this jam  
'Cause money that's the plan  
Tryin' to get through this maze  
Not to win this race  
We either ridin' on our horse  
Or walkin' on our face  
So come take your place on the side of love  
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
Can't wait 'till you the next man  
Can't wait 'till you the next man...

Savannah
Zao
----------------
A day not to forget  
The machine has collapsed under the program it's been given  
Look inside the broken shell  
Look inside the broken shell  
To see the broken heart  
They can't believe the machine was alive but we saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
  
The machine it falls apart and when it's cut it bleed  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
She was alive

If I Could
Erasure
----------------
Make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you know what you're talking about  
I don't believe you go and ever find out for yourself  
Always got a lot to say  
Well I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you care about the consequences  
I don't believe you share in what you know we know is true  
Turning keys and locking doors  
I won't accept that anymore  
Won't accept that anymore  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you know about the hearts you've broken  
I don't believe you show what your intentions really are  
Can you hear? What have you done?  
There's not enough for everyone  
Not enough for anyone  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
If I could, you know I would

Four Walls
Willie Nelson
----------------
Out where the bright lights are glowing  
You're drawn like a moth to a flame  
You laugh while the wine's overflowing  
While I sit and whisper your name  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me  
  
Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting  
But my walls have nothing to say  
I'm made for love not for hating  
So here where you left I stay  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me  
  
One night with you is like heaven  
And so while I'm walking the floor  
I listen for steps in the hallway  
And wait for your knock on my door  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me

Five Short Minutes
Jim Croce
----------------
Well, she was standing by my dressing room after the show  
Asking for my autograph and asked if she could go  
Back to my motel room. But the rest is just a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well, like a fool in a hurry I took her to my room  
She casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune  
Then I said, "Ooh, ooee!" Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well, then a judge and a jury sat me in a room  
They say that robbin' the cradle is worse than robbin' the tomb  
Then I said "Ooh, ooee!" Sure was a tragic tale  
(Wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it!)  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
And when I get out of this prison gonna be forty-five  
I'll know I used to like to do it but I won't remember why  
(Wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it!)  
I'll say "Ooh, ooee! Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail

Hooks
Kelly Family
----------------
Talk about lovers  
They're bothyoung and very pretty  
They're in love but he betrays her  
He says sorry and so she wants  
To believe him that it's why  
He's got her on his hooks  
Bridge  
What you do to me I can do to you  
Babe set me free then I'll let you be  
Come on, come on nowdon't you fool around  
Cause you're hurting me  
Won't you let me be  
Chorus  
You got me on your hooks  
You're a bastard  
You got me on your hooks  
You're a bastard  
You know it's true  
You got me on your hooks  
Then one day he decides to marry her  
She doesn't want to  
Because she doesn't believe him  
I saw you kissing that girl last week  
But I still think you love me  
That' why you got me  
Bridge  
Chorus  
I know it's crazy  
But I know it won't be long  
I know it's crazy  
But I know I will survive lalala lalala  
Bridge  
You got me on you're hooks

Seven Caged Tigers
Stone Temple Pilots
----------------
Pass the time kickin' as time rips by  
Neither goose nor the gander fly  
Buy a minute spend an hour burnin' burnin'  
Take a peek as the model earns it earns it  
Walk a mile as it keeps crawlin' crawlin'  
Clean the politician, wash with everpure  
  
So the answer gets harder  
A nd the truth's getting farther and farther  
And the bottle keeps churnin'  
Seven caged tigers fly by  
  
Wastin' time chasing those cows that fly  
Churnin' out all that butterfly sugarboost  
Track the blade as it swoops downward and onward  
Take a pill it'll kill martyrs, martyrs  
  
Passin' time rippin' as time kicks by  
Pass the umbilical cord down for this flyby  
Take a sneak while the model earns it, earns it  
Hike a mile as it keeps crawlin'  
  
So the answer gets harder  
And the truth's getting farther and farther  
And the bottle keeps churnin'  
Seven caged tigers fly by

Midnight Blue
Vanessa Williams
----------------
Whatever it is, it'll keep till morning  
Haven't we both got better things to do, midnight blue  
Even though simple things become rough  
Haven't we had enough  
  
I think we can make it  
One more time, if we try  
One more time for all the old times  
For all the times you told me you need me  
Needing me now is something I could use, midnight blue  
Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend  
Maybe it's not the end  
  
And I think we can make it  
One more time, if we try  
One more time for all the old times, midnight blue, midnight blue  
I think we can make it  
I think we can make it  
Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend  
  
Think of me as your friend  
And I think we can make it  
One more time, if we try  
One more time for all of the old old times  
Midnight blue, midnight blue, midnight blue, midnight blue

Deadly Nightshade
Megadeth
----------------
Come now my lovely, won't you  
Take a midnight stroll with me?  
Through the misty air the things  
I keep I shouldn't dare  
  
My garden's so inviting, and its  
Deadly blooms are hiding  
Be careful what you touch  
'Less the grave is what you lust  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Each night at midnight  
Dating back into the fog of time  
Another victim falls  
The things I've done, the voices call  
  
The Hourglass runs out on us  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
The killers must be fed, the soil is red  
Now that you're dead  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Delirium, your burning throat  
Mania, your heart rate soars  
Hallucination, you're losing your mind  
Suffocation, cannot breathe, you're going blind  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Deadly nightshade  
Deadly nightshade  
Nightshade, nightshade

I Saw Him Standing There
Tiffany
----------------
Well he was just seventeen  
If you know what I mean  
The way he looked was way beyond compare  
  
I'll never dance with another  
When I saw him standing there  
  
Well, he looked at me  
And I could see that before too long  
I'd fall in love with him  
  
And he'd never dance with another  
When I saw him standing there  
  
Well, my heart went boom  
As I crossed the room  
And I held his hand in mine  
  
Whoa, we danced through the night  
We held each other tight and  
Before too long  
I fell in love with him  
  
Well, my heart went boom  
As I crossed the room  
And I held his hand in mine  
  
Whoa, we danced through the night  
We held each other tight and  
Before too long  
I fell in love with him  
  
I'll never dance with another  
When I saw him standing there

Please Do Not Go
Violent Femmes
----------------
Tell you man I'm stuck on this lovely girl  
Of course to me you' know she mean all the world  
But then she like another guy  
I fall down dead she never see the tears I cry  
Please please please do not go  
How long can the days go on  
When my love is so strong  
And I know I cannot tell a lie  
I want to see him go bye  
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye  
  
Now I wonder what she would say  
If I told her that I felt this way  
Why know it might make her turn either way  
So all I can do is patiently pray  
Pray pray pray pray  
Tell you man I'm stuck on this lovely girl  
And why know I could travel all over the whole world  
Please please please do not go  
You hurt me so  
I got something to show you

Because I Love You
Dolly Parton
----------------
I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep  
And wonder who I was before I loved you  
Lying here beside you feeling so complete  
Thinking how I love and need and trust you  
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me  
I can face the world and have the cause I love you  
Because you love me because I love you  
  
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there  
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me  
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours  
Love as strong as this lets you control me  
Because I love you...  
Because I love you...

Why Can't He Be You
Norah Jones
----------------
He takes me to the places you and I used to go  
He tells me over and over that he loves me so  
He gives me love that I never got from you  
He loves me too, his love is true  
Why can't he be you  
He never fails to call and tell me I'm on his mind  
And I'm lucky to have such a guy, I hear it all the time  
And he does all the things that you would never do  
He loves me too, his love is true  
Why can't he be you  
He's not the one who dominates my mind and soul  
And I should love him so 'cause he loves me, I know  
But his kisses leave me cold  
He sends me flowers, calls on the hour, just to prove his love  
And my friends say when he's around that I'm all he speaks of  
And he does all the things that you would never do  
He loves me too, his love is true  
Why can't he be you  
He's not the one who dominates my mind and soul  
And I should love him so 'cause he loves me, I know  
But his kisses leave me cold  
He sends me flowers, calls on the hour, just to prove his love  
And my friends say when he's around, I'm all he speaks of  
And he does all the things that you would never do  
He loves me too, his love is true  
Why can't he be you

Don't fear the morning  
It's okay  
It's okay  
Hurt weighs heavy  
It's okay  
It's okay  
  
When your body's  
Cold and shaking

Past the pines  
Through the rain

Let sun shine  
On your face  
And when your mind is  
Old and fading  
I'll heal you, darling,  
Heal you  
  
Your soul lights the day  
voy en camino
voy en camino
When your soul filled with pain  
voy en camino

Maybe, baby, it's just me  
Maybe, baby it's just  
  
In a matter of  
In a matter of days  
We'll find love  
Yeah, in a matter of  
In a matter of days  
We'll find love  
  
Well maybe, baby, that's just love  
And maybe, baby, it's just me

And it's going to get easier on you  
And it's going to get easier on you  
And it's going to get easier on you  
Now it's got to get easier on your soul  
  
Soul [Repeat: x 3]  
  
Your soul lights the way  
Lights the way  
voy en camino
Well maybe, baby, it's just me

The March Of The Black Queen
Queen
----------------
Do you mean it ?  
Do you mean it ?  
Do you mean it ?  
Why don't you mean it ?  
Why do I follow you and where do you go  
Aah aah aah aah aah aah  
  
You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life  
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive  
Let me tell you all about it  
And the world will so allow it  
Ooh give me a little time to choose  
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight  
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night  
  
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile  
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file  
Take this, take that, bring them down to size  
March to the Black Queen  
  
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys  
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil  
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe  
We've only begun - begun  
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise  
March to the Black Queen  
Now I've got a belly-full  
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes  
  
La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa  
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa  
A voice from behind me reminds me  
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)  
Spread out your wings you are an angel  
Remember to deliver with the speed of light  
A little bit of love and joy  
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore  
A little bit of love and joy  
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover  
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love  
  
Aah ah aah  
La la la la laa  
Ah ah ah ah aah  
Ah la la la laa  
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right  
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night  
I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen  
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie  
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like  
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black
Queen  
  
Ah aah ah aah  
Ah aah ah aah  
Walking true to style  
She's vulgar 'buse and vile  
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies  
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"  
  
She's our leader  
La la la la laa la la laa  
La la la la la laa  
  
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies  
Surrender to the city of the fireflies  
Dance with the devil in beat with the band  
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand  
But now it's time to be gone - (la la la laaa) forever - forever  
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah

Do You Love Me
Kiss
----------------
You really like my limousine  
You like the way the wheels roll  
You like my seven inch leather heels  
And goin' to all of the shows, but  
Do you love me, do you love me  
Do you love me, really love me  
You like the credit cards and private planes  
Money can really take you far  
You like the hotels and fancy clothes  
And the sound of electric guitars, but  
Do you love me, do you love me  
Do you love me, I mean like do you  
Really love me  
You really like rock 'n' roll  
All of the fame and the masquerade  
You like the concerts and studios  
And all the money, honey, that I make, but  
Do you love me, do you love me  
Do you love me, really love me  
Your backstage pass and black sunglasses  
Make you look just like a queen  
Even the fans, they know your face  
From all of the magazines, but  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Really love me (really love me)  
I want to know  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
I mean like do you  
Really love me (really love me)  
I want to know  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
I mean like do you  
Really love me (really love me)  
I want you to (do you love me, do you love me)  
I need you to (do you love me, do you love me)  
And you know I'm so tired of everybody sayin' it  
And you know, (do you love me, do you love me)  
I just gotta know if you really really really, really love me  
(do you love me, do you love me)  
So come on, do you love me (do you love me)  
I need you to  
Do you love me (do you love me) I want you to  
Do you love me (do you love me) I need you  
Really love me (do you love me)  
I want to know  
Do you love me (do you love me) do you, do you  
Do you love me (do you love me)  
I just got to have some love (do you love me, do you love me)  
I just got to have some love (do you love me)  
I just got to have some love, love, love, love, love

Funky is the word,  
You're right,  
Or grow strong,  
Funky is the word.  
  
Oh, this is so funky,  
Funky in my heart,  
This girl is funky,  
The girl in my dreams cracks me up.  
  
Funky, oh that's the word,  
But Jane, do you really care how funky styles of your could be?  
Can you just see me lone-ly?  
Funky is the word you could only say.  
  
It's so funky,  
Jane, can't you see?  
You could be loved by any boy in the world,  
Funky, it's the word.  
  
The word is funky,  
The word is funky,  
Oh how a shame,  
It's too funky.

If I Could Only Win Your Love
Emmylou Harris
----------------
If I could only win your love  
I'd make the most of everything  
I'd proudly wear your wedding ring  
My heart would never stray when you're away  
  
If I could only win your love  
I'd give my all to make it live  
You'll never know how much I give  
If I could only win your love  
  
Oh how can I ever say  
How I crave your love when your gone away  
Oh how can I ever show  
How I burn inside when you hold me tight  
  
If I could only win your love  
I'd give my all to make it live  
You'll never know how much I give  
If I could only win your love  
  
Oh how can I ever say  
How I crave your love when your gone away  
Oh how can I ever show  
How I burn inside when you hold me tight  
  
If I could only win your love  
I'd give my all to make it live  
You'll never know how much I give  
If I could only win your love

Anathema
Twenty One Pilots
----------------
You will never know what's behind my skull,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
You will never know what's under my hair,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
You will never know what's under my skin,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
You will never know what is in my veins,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
Won't you go to someone else's dreams?  
Won't you go to someone else's head?  
Haven't you taken enough from me?  
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?  
  
And you will never know what I'm thinking of,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
And you will never understand what I believe,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
Haven't you taken enough from me?  
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?  
Won't you go to someone else's dreams?  
Won't you go to someone else's head?  
Haven't you taken enough from me?  
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?  
  
I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I  
Don't know where I should go,  
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply.  
  
Taking time in a simple place,  
In my bed, where my head rests on a pillowcase  
And it's said that a war's lead but I forget  
That I let another day go by.  
  
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days  
I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther  
My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my Father  
Am I screaming to an empty sky?  
  
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free.  
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep.

Dweller On The Threshold
Van Morrison
----------------
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I have seen without perceiving  
I have been another man  
Let me pierce the realm of glamor  
So I know just what I am  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
Feel the angel of the present  
In the mighty crystal fire  
Lift me up consume my darkness  
Let me travel even higher  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
As I cross the burning ground  
Let me go down to the water  
Watch the great illusion drown  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I'm gonna turn and face the music  
The music of the spheres  
Lift me up consume my darkness  
When the midnight disappears  
  
I will walk out of the darkness  
And I'll walk into the light  
And I'll sing the song of ages  
And the dawn will end the night  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I cross some burning ground  
And I'll go down to the water  
Let the great illusion drown  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
Dweller on the threshold  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
I'm a dweller on the threshold

You (Or Somebody Like You)
Keith Urban
----------------
Outside my window, I swear on my mamas grave,  
Faded out the street noise like an out of focus Polaroid,  
So I shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,  
Making me think that you were, here again,  
Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,  
That's the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,  
So we combed the corners, and glass houses,  
Right directions, but, never found it.  
  
Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,  
Just the mere reflection of your face,  
For one shining moment  
  
With you, or somebody like you,  
With you, or somebody just like you,  
  
Called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,  
The drew chalk circles round, the place that we used to lay,  
But nobody testified, not a single witness,  
I swore I was crucified with, no forgiveness,  
The sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous,  
My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,  
And in my blindspot, I saw the silhouette,  
Your crazy legs smoking a long black cigarette,  
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,  
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,  
I'd fill up all this empty space,  
  
With you, or somebody like you,  
With you, or somebody just like you,  
Oh you, or somebody like you, oh  
  
Now I should of learned my lesson,  
Done what I was told,  
Should of counted all my blessings,  
Like fingers and toes,  
And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,  
And searching high and low,  
For you, or somebody like you  
For you, or somebody just like you  
  
For you, or somebody like you,  
For you, or somebody just like you, oh oh  
  
Yeah, whoa somebody just like you  
Oh somebody just like you, oh

Down To Our Last Goodbye
Willie Nelson
----------------
This was my last mistake  
That's all her heart could take  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
  
Her lips won't kiss me now  
The lips that I taught how  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
  
What can I tell her  
That I haven't told her  
That would change her mind  
'Cause she heard that line before  
Now all that's left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
What can I tell her  
That I haven't told her  
That would change her mind  
'Cause she heard that line before  
Now all that's left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now we're down to our last goodbye

Up On That Cloud
Nick Drake
----------------
It's so easy to fall in love with you  
I know I did for a day or two  
You never noticed lost in your crowd  
Just no room for me up on that cloud  
  
Can't find no changes  
For better in my luck  
Empty are my eyes and my heart  
Cold grey days  
The nights are so long  
My heart is sinking  
Bound to a stone  
  
This old world is a bag of tricks  
A whole lot of nothin'  
Where nothin' ever fits  
In all her glory she just don't compare  
To one single tear  
In your beautiful eyes  
  
Thank you December  
For your cold grey air  
Lakes are frozen, trees are bare  
I once loved her  
Of that I am proud  
Just no room for me  
Up on that cloud

Kenny Chesney
----------------
[Verse 1]  
Wrecking balls, downtown construction  
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing  
Cardboard sign says the lord is coming  
Tick, tick, tock  
Rumors turn the mills back home  
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown  
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off  
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here  
Seems like all we ever hear is  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Verse 2]  
24 hour television, get so loud that no one listens  
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk  
But there really ain't no conversation  
Ain't nothing left to the imagination  
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop  
  
[Chorus]  
This noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Bridge]  
Every room, every house, every shade of noise  
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise  
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise  
We can't take the noise, so we just make...  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Outro]  
All this noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't stand the noise  
Can't take the noise

One Pm Again
Yo La Tengo
----------------
Well, it's 1 PM again  
I guess I'm ready to begin  
And it's reeling, there is a feeling  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
You don't have to show me how  
But I'm not ready to right now  
There is a feeling, and it's reeling  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
And if we don't leave today  
There's no hurry anyway  
I'm on the road here, safe at home here  
So let's make sure we're sure  
That it is reeling, and I'm pleading  
Let's not make any sudden moves

Larger Than Life
Backstreet Boys
----------------
I may run and hide  
When you're screamin' my name, alright  
But let me tell you now  
There are prices to fame, alright  
All of our time spent in flashes of light  
  
[Chorus]  
All you people can't you see, can't you see  
How your love's affecting our reality  
Every time we're down  
You can make it right  
And that makes you larger than life  
  
Looking at the crowd  
And I see your body sway, c'mon  
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon  
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All of your time spent keeps us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, every time we're down  
Yeah, you can make it right  
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life  
  
[Chorus]

Writing's On The Wall
George Harrison
----------------
The writing's on the wall brother  
Your life is in your hands  
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall.  
  
It looks you in the eye mister  
It's time we stand up tall  
Go see and understand the writing's on the wall.  
  
Strange we hold on to things that have no grace  
Or power  
While death holds on to us much more with every  
Passing hour  
And all the time you thought it would last  
Your life, your friends would always be  
'Til they're drunk away or shot away or die away  
From you.  
  
There's nothing that you need sister  
The Lord is in you all  
Life is designed to see the writing's on the wall.  
  
The music's in the air mothers  
You may have heard it call  
To you that you may see the writing's on the wall.  
  
Be careful going home sister  
Be watchful down that road  
You've got a lot of love sister  
More to grow.  
  
The writing's on the wall brothers  
Your life is in your hands  
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall  
I hope that you may see the writing's on the wal

Telluride
Tim McGraw
----------------
When I was nineteen,  
I threw my stuff in the car  
I headed up to the Rockies, got a job at this bar  
Sellin' beer to the locals, just barely gettin' by  
On the tips from the rich kids, their on Daddy's dime  
But when I saw her walk in one night  
I knew that I'd be alright in...  
  
[Chorus]  
Telluride  
The snow fallin' down  
I was wakin' up with her in that sleepy little town  
In her eyes my world came so alive  
  
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride  
  
We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire  
Castin' shadows on the cabin wall, drownin' in desire  
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud  
So high up on that mountain  
I thought we'd never come down  
It was a dream we were livin' in  
And I was the happiest I'd ever been, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telleride  
  
It ended just like a movie scene  
And I had to play the part  
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave  
And me with the frozen heart, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I never will forget the day she said good bye, in Telluride  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride  
  
Telluride [Repeat until fade]

Behind The Ritual
Van Morrison
----------------
Drinking wine in the alley, drinking wine in the alley  
Making time, drinking that wine  
Out of my mind in the days gone by  
  
Making time with Sally, drinking that wine  
In the days gone by, talking all out of my mind  
Drinking that wine, talking all out of my mind  
  
Spin and turning in the alley, spin and turning in the alley  
Like a Whirling Dervish in the alley, drinking that wine  
Drinking wine, making time in the days gone by  
  
Boogie woogie child in the alley  
Drinking that wine, making time, talking all out of my mind  
Drinking wine in the days gone by, behind the ritual  
  
Behind the ritual, behind the ritual  
In the days gone by, drinking that wine  
Making time, drinking that wine way back in time  
  
Spin and turn and rhyme in the alley  
Spin and turning, making up rhymes, talking all out of my mind  
Talking that jive, drinking that wine in the days gone by  
  
Drinking wine in the alley, drinking that wine  
Making time, talking all out of my mind  
Drinking that wine making time in the alley  
  
Behind the ritual, behind the ritual  
You find the spiritual, you find the spiritual  
Behind the ritual in the days gone by  
  
Drinking wine in the alley, drinking wine in the alley  
Making time, talking all out of my mind  
Drinking that wine in the days gone by, days gone by  
  
Spin and turn talking that jive  
Spin and turn talking that jive all out of our minds  
Drinking that sweet wine  
Making time, making time in the days gone by  
  
Behind the ritual, behind the ritual  
Behind the ritual, behind the ritual  
Drinking that wine making time in the days gone by  
  
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  
  
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  
Behind the ritual, making time in the days gone by  
  
In the days gone by, in the days gone by  
Drink that wine, making time  
Getting high in the days gone by, drinking that wine  
  
Getting high behind the ritual  
Getting high behind the ritual  
Drinking that wine in the days gone by  
  
Behind the ritual, behind the ritual  
Behind the ritual, behind that spiritual  
In the days gone by drinking that wine and getting high  
  
So high behind the ritual, so high behind the ritual  
So high in the days gone by  
Drinking that wine making time, making time  
  
Stretching time, stretching time  
Drinking that wine, stretching time  
Stretching time in the days gone by behind the ritual  
  
Behind the ritual  
Behind the ritual

Mary Skeffington
Olivia Newton-John
----------------
Mary Skeffington, close your eyes  
And make believe that you are just a girl again  
Go to sleep tonight, dream of days  
When you had something there to light the way  
  
Remember a holiday in a north of England town  
You slept in a room upstairs on a bed of eiderdown  
  
Mary Skeffington, when you wake  
You mustn't be afraid to face another day  
Think of what you had, you'll get by  
You've always been a lady, hold your head up high  
  
Look back on your home where you spent the best years of your life  
Remember the man who asked you if you would be his wife

Sacrifice Of Praise
Don Moen
----------------
How can I say thanks  
For everything You've done  
And how can I give praise  
Lord You've given me so much  
You gave it all  
You paid the price  
Now I want to give You my life  
  
Chorus:  
As a sacrifice of praise  
O lift it up to You  
Lord I give my heart away  
O I give it all to you  
Lord make my life an offering  
Let me worship You in everything I do  
  
A sacrifice of praise I give to You  
  
In sunshine and in rain  
In sorrow and in pain  
Lord I will give You praise  
And choose to bless Your name  
You gave it all  
And You paid the price  
Now I want to give You my life  
  
Lord I want to lift You up  
Lord I want to lift You up

I Can Take Anything
Hank Williams Jr.
----------------
I can take anything cause I'm different from the rest  
Your lying lips don't bother me they still bring me happiness  
And I don't see all the things other people say you do  
I can take anything but losing you  
I can take anything cause I'm living for that day  
You get tired of running round and come back in my arms to stay  
I don't care how long you treat me like you do I can take anything but losing
tú
I can take anything cause my heart's learned to live  
Oh what you used to be and the love you used to give  
How do I take it now knowing I'm just a fool I can take anything but losing
tú

After All
Roxette
----------------
Now it's about time I wrote you a letter  
Hey baby it's me for worse or for better  
Got nothing to waste in pace for another lane  
Now last only gain I know all we had  
Has dried like a desert stands from the sand  
Still on my t-shirt and I create a drink  
Of heavenly cool cool rain  
  
And after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret big or small  
After all there wasn't a loop hole  
We were found to take the fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
  
Now it's about time I said all the story  
You slept into late and missed all the glory  
Get stuck in a dream that finally blurred your brain  
I try to stay same, hey love is a blinded  
Pops up the window but no one will find teardrops on my pillow  
As I race the glass of heavenly cool champagne  
  
Cause after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret large or small, oh  
After all we prove any key-hole  
And you'll see we were bounce to fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
Life goes on and on and on after all, after all  
  
And after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret big or small  
After all there wasn't a loop hole  
We were found to take the fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
Life goes on and on and on after all

Monkey's Paw
Misfits
----------------
No stone cries tears for the dead  
Christmas presents in cold white linen  
No stones cries tears for the dead  
Too late for pity, too late for revenge  
  
Coins in a fountain, coins in a well  
You dream of heaven, you live in hell  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
No stone tries to bring back the dead  
Too late for stories, too late for forgiveness  
No stone tries to bring back the dead  
All these tales are best forgotten  
  
Coins in a fountain, coins in a well  
You dream of heaven, you live in hell  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you

Boom Boom
Chris Rea
----------------
Take a look what's be going on behind me  
I swear to God this ain't no making of my own  
  
That stupid cupid arrow  
Lost for years and never found me  
Now she's dancing on my history  
And she drives the dagger home  
  
'Cause when I see that angel walking past my window  
When I see that angel walking past my door  
I know what this tired old heart's been waiting, waiting for  
Boom boom  
Boom boom  
  
And I can't win  
There ain't no us denying  
So many years of experience  
Tell me it's so  
  
That stupid cupid arrow  
Lost for years and never found me  
Now she's dancing on my history  
And she drives the dagger home  
  
'Cause when I see that angel walking past my window  
When I see that angel walking past my door  
I know what this tired old heart's been waiting, waiting for  
Boom boom  
Boom boom

Stand By Your Man
Patsy Cline
----------------
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman  
Givin' all your love to just one man  
You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times  
Doin' things that you don't understand  
  
But if you love him, then you'll forgive him  
Even though he's hard to understand  
And if you love him, oh, be proud of him  
'Cause after all he's just a man  
  
Stand by your man  
Give him two arms to cling to  
And somethin' warm to come to  
When nights are cold and lonely  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin' all the love you can  
Stand by your man  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin' all the love you can  
Stand by your man

Lining Your Pockets
Ocean Colour Scene
----------------
You're lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Well hello my old friend  
You know I've been away  
I'm not asking for much  
But please remember my name  
  
'Cause you've been lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Well I wondered through fortune  
And I flirted with fame  
But we never got the money  
We always gave it away  
  
Said you've been lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Old bench-mark on the park  
He got lost on the world  
But he doesn't seem to know  
About any of it at all  
  
He said,  
"All the things that I wanted  
You know I had to pay and pay and pay"  
And so I say  
  
You're lining your pockets  
for no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Yeah you've been lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
You're lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay

Dazed And Confused
Nirvana
----------------
Been dazed and confused for so long  
It's not true,  
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.  
Lots of people talk and few of them know,  
Soul of a woman was created below.  
  
You hurt and abused telling all of your lies,  
Run arounds sweet baby lord how they hypnotize.  
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been,  
Gonna love you baby here I come again  
  
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay  
Try to love you baby but you push me away.  
Don't know where you're going only know just where you've been,  
Sweet little baby I want you again.  
  
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true,  
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.  
Take it easy baby let them say what they will.  
Won't hurt so much when I send you the bill

The Monkey That Became President
Tom T. Hall
----------------
I was there on the day the monkey came into this world  
His face was round and reddish and his hair was slightly curled  
He didn't look too different from the others I had seen  
Who'd-a-thought he was the answer to the nation's dream?  
At first he didn't seem to be intelligent at all  
Each time he'd start to walk about he'd stumble and he'd fall  
My first impression was to be a most mistaken thought  
Lord a'mighty, what's this little hairy monkey wrought?  
Because I witnessed his departure from his mother's womb  
I felt inclined to check his progress every afternoon  
One day the keeper of the zoo called in the live TV  
Frankly said, "I think you'll be amazed at what you see"  
The monkey walked and talked and waved his arms about his head  
In the corner was the stack of books that he had read  
"An Educated Monkey!", said the papers 'cross the land  
It was more than weary sociologists could stand  
Oh, his fame was universal, he was on the Carson show  
People talked about him kindly everywhere he'd go  
His insight was amazing, his philosophy was fair  
He became a politician welcome everywhere  
His wit was not to be compared with any mind intact  
He'd lace a phrase with irony and blend it all with fact  
Conservatives applauded and the liberals were entranced  
The bigots and the integrationists were in his camp  
Nobody dared to meet him in an open press debate  
He was nominated by the folks from every state  
Yes, a monkey was the President, though maybe not the first  
And there was peace and harmony throughout the universe  
The dream I had last night has been related as it came  
As for interpretation, well, it's really very plain  
Would you rather have a monkey up in Washington, D.C.  
Or have those people making monkeys out of you and me?

Hitam Putih
Dewa 19
----------------
Dibatas lelah  
Kuhentikan, langkah hidup ini  
Mungkin harusnya aku mengerti  
Semua adanya  
Bila... Kubayangkan warna hidupku  
  
Reff:  
Kulukis dunia hitam dan putih  
Yang hanya berselang  
Tawa... Tangis...  
  
Ada saat  
Kutenggelam, dilumpur - lumpur  
Kupastikan, kuhempaskan  
Diriku dijalanan lurus  
Semua itu harus tertelan pahit dan manis  
Back to Reff:  
  
Aku memang manusia  
Yang takkan mungkin  
Harus selalu putih  
Akupun tak ingin  
Terlukis hitam lagi  
Biarlah hidup  
Berjalan lagi apa adanya  
  
Hitam... Putih...  
Pahit.... Manis...  
Tawa.... Tangis....

The Real Thing
Faith No More
----------------
I know the feeling  
It is the real thing  
The essence of the truth  
The perfect moment  
That golden moment  
I know you feel it too  
I know the feeling  
It is the real thing  
You can't refuse the embrace  
It's like the pattern below the skin  
You gotta reach out and pull it all in  
And you feel like you're too close  
So you swallow another dose  
The pinnacle of happiness  
Filling up your soul  
You don't think you can take any more  
You never want to let go  
To touch the roots of experience  
The most basic ingredients  
Toi see the unseen glitter of life  
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife  
Cherish the certainty of now  
It kills you a bit at a time  
cradle the inspiration  
It will leave you writhing on the floor...  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
This nourishment, life is bent  
Into a shape I can hold  
A twist of fate, all my own  
Just grit your teeth, make no sound  
Take a step away and look around  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
The whisper is but a shout  
That's what it is all about  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the sacred song that someone sings through you  
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into  
Like the dream one day you know will come to life  
Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger  
It's the jewel of victory  
The chasm of misery  
And once you have bitten the core  
You will always know the flavor  
The split second of divinity  
You drink up the sky  
All of heaven is in your arms  
You know the reason why  
It's right there, all by itself  
And what you are, there is nothing else  
You're growing a life within a life  
The lips of wonder kiss you inside  
And when it's over the feeling remains  
It all comes down to this  
The smoke clears, I see what it is  
That made me feel this way  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood  
Pump through your veins, can't explain  
The element that's everything  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after  
Like the first time love urged you to take guidance, in silence  
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying  
Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending  
I know

Rattlesnake Shake

Baby, if you got to rock  
I got to be your rockin' horse  
Baby, think you'd like to roll  
Maybe your diggin' it more  
They're shakin' the world  
When it's time to crash  
But when I get home tonight  
I guess I got to shake myself  
  
You need some love  
You must have the blues  
Ain't but the one thing  
A good man can do  
He do the shake  
The rattlesnake shake  
Man, do the shake  
Yes, and jerk away the blues  
Now, jerk it  
  
Now, I know this guy  
His name is mick  
Now, he don't care when he ain't got no chick  
He do the shake  
The rattlesnake shake  
Yes, he do the shake  
And jerks away the blues  
Now, jerk it

Never Make You Cry
Eric Clapton
----------------
It's so easy loving you  
With everything I feel inside,  
And holding me the way you do,  
It's here I'm staying all of my life.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll never ever make you cry.  
I'll never ever say goodbye.  
Can't you see it in my eyes?  
I'm yours until the day I die.  
  
I'll watch you fall asleep at night,  
I'll smile and kiss you, hold you tight,  
I'll hold your hand and close my eyes,  
It's here I'm staying all of my life.

Black Is The Color Of My True Love's Hair
Nina Simone
----------------
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
His face so soft and wondrous fair  
The purest eyes  
And the strongest hands  
I love the ground on where he stands  
I love the ground on where he stands  
  
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Of my true love's hair  
Of my true love's hair  
  
Oh I love my lover  
And where he goes  
Yes, I love the ground on where he goes  
And still I hope  
That the time will come  
When he and I will be as one  
When he and I will be as one  
  
So black is the color of my true love's hair  
Black is the color of my true love's hair  
Black is the color of my true love's hair

Life Itself
Chris Brown
----------------
[Verse 1 - Chris Brown]  
It kills me to see you cry  
Even more when I tell a lie  
And it's always something I do, to you baby  
And I'm so sorry for all the things that I did  
And I can't say goodbye or let you just walk away  
So I'll admit my wrongs and I hope you hear this  
Cause it's a song I made for you  
And I'm hoping maybe I could win back your heart  
So please don't say goodbye I know that loves still there somewhere  
[Chorus:]  
Wish I could give the world  
And I know it hurts sometimes when you deserve the world  
Nothing comes in between us  
So you can never separate me from your love, oh darling  
I'm never ever letting go  
Cause I love you more than life itself  
  
[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]  
Just want you on my team girl  
And I don't give a damn about nothing else but the way I feel with you  
It's so amazing yeah  
If I never get to see you oh  
Then I might as well never even know meanwhile I'm  
I love you so that I can't let you go  
And I ain't trying to be selfish no  
Just here to tell you that you got my heart  
And only you can tear it apart  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Wish I could give the world  
And I know it hurts sometimes when you deserve the world  
Nothing comes in between us  
So you can never separate me from your love, oh darling  
I'm never ever letting go  
Cause I love you more than life itself  
  
[Verse 3 - Kevin Mccall]  
Make it easy, easy to love ya  
So I ain't gotta look no where else  
I know I felt the right one, call me crazy  
But I love my baby more than anything  
And something's taking over  
Anything you want I'll hand it over  
Imma ride this thing till the wheels fall off  
Till the end of time I'm forever yours  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Wish I could give the world  
And I know it hurts sometimes when you deserve the world  
Nothing comes in between us  
So you can never separate me from your love, oh darling  
I'm never ever letting go  
Cause I love you more than life itself  
Ohh no I love you more than life itself

Keep On Shining
Natalie Grant
----------------
He will be there  
Through the hurricane  
Through the pouring rain  
He will be there  
  
Through the longest night  
Everything's gonna be alright  
The storm is gonna end  
And the sun's gonna rise again  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep on shining  
Let Love light up the darkest sky  
And you'll be flying  
Rise above all the hardest times  
So hold on (Hold on)  
Be strong (Be strong)  
Come on (Come on, come on)  
Keep on shining  
  
Nothing can stop  
The way He feels  
'Cause His Love's so real  
No mountain top  
  
Will ever be too high  
'Cause with Jesus by your side  
There's nothing you can't do  
You're gonna make it through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know in your soul  
You know in your heart  
He will always be your only  
Guiding star

I'll Be Home For Christmas
Carpenters
----------------
I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know  
  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
  
Please, have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams

Hungry For Love
Whitesnake
----------------
I keep hangin' on the promise of love  
Your eyes tell me that I'm gonna see  
I feel the hunger like a starving man  
Honey, when you stand close to me  
  
I start to shiver, I start to shake,  
Chills up an' down my spine,  
I'm in the mood for action  
In need of satisfaction,  
Babe, I'm gonna make you mine  
  
Now I believe in you,  
An' everything that you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I've got the weakness of an ordinary man  
I need the comfort of womanly mind,  
But, I get nervous when I think about  
So many women an' so little time  
  
But, I believe in you,  
An' everything you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I start to shiver, I start to shake,  
Chills up an' down my spine,  
I get so nervous when I think about  
So many women an' not enough time  
  
But, I believe in you,  
An' everything that you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I'm hungry for love

Boys And Girls
Human League
----------------
Boys and girls come out to play, playing till they're old and grey  
Time to leave the old school suit, grown ups can be real cute  
Do you think they're wiser than in the past  
How long do you think it's gonna last  
I don't have to prove to you adults can be kidding too  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
  
Boys and girls stay home today  
Think they're more mature that way  
Secret friends can soon be found  
Indiscretions underground  
Maybe growing up can seem more graceful  
If they make their style become more tasteful  
With your looks you could go far  
But better watch the calendar  
  
(The Sound Of A Church Wedding)  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh

Abandoned Love
Bob Dylan
----------------
I can hear the turning of the key  
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.  
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain  
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.  
  
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost  
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?  
  
Everybody's wearing a disguise  
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.  
But me, I can't cover what I am  
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you I'm not free.  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?  
  
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,  
The pot of gold is only make-believe.  
The treasure can't be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,  
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.  
My head tells me it's time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.  
  
One more time at midnight, near the wall  
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.  
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.

Big Dumb Rocket
Our Lady Peace
----------------
I've never seen your breath before  
But I'm disgusted by the thought of  
Waiting anymore  
If I look up in your eyes  
Will you notice me or notice it or  
Fade into this accident  
I don't want to find  
The big dumb rocket on your mind  
Its mostly you and mostly me  
And a tired gun that's not empty  
I've never been this sad before  
But I'm disgusted by my fingertips  
And what they've done  
If I look into your eyes  
If it must be true you must believe  
I've never held such violent things  
I've never talked to God before tonight  
But I'm disgusted by

It All Seems To Fall Into Line
Perry Como
----------------
Something's missin', when you hold me,  
You don't whisper that you're mine,  
Oh it all seems to fall into line!  
  
Every promise that you make me,  
Breaks like bubbles in the wine,  
And it all seems to fall into line!  
  
In a fog that isn't lifting,  
We are drifting apart,  
I can see someone's replaced me in your heart!  
  
There's a coolness in your kisses,  
That is only one more sign,  
How it all seems to fall into line!  
  
In a fog that isn't lifting,  
We are drifting apart,  
I can see someone's replaced me in your heart!  
  
There's a coolness in your kisses,  
That is only one more sign,  
How it all seems to fall into line!  
  
Yes it all seems to fall into line!

I Will Go With You
Donna Summer
----------------
(Con Te Partiro)  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
Your love was a light  
In the darkness that shone  
So profoundly  
Say that you'll stay  
Do not be afraid, afraid  
You, you're my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper  
  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
It's you who first found me  
Come here, come here  
Put your arms around me,  
Come here  
It's you who surrounds me  
Come here, come here  
Come here  
Come here  
You, you're my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper  
  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true

In love together  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true

In love together  
  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me,  
Wherever you are  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
In my...

Did Ye Get Healed?
Van Morrison
----------------
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
Did you get it down in your soul?  
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
And did the feelin' grow?  
  
Sometimes, when the spirit moves me  
I can do many wondrous things  
I want to know when the spirit moves you  
Did ye get healed?  
  
I begin to realize  
It manifest in my life  
In oh, so many ways  
Every day I want to talk about it  
And walk about it  
Everyday I want to be closer  
  
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
Did you get it down in your soul?  
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
Did ye get healed?  
  
I begin to realize  
Magic in my life  
See it manifest in oh, so many ways  
Every day is gettin' better and better  
I want to be daily walking close  
  
It gets stronger when you get the feelin'  
When you get it down in your soul  
And it makes you feel good  
And it makes you feel whole  
  
When the spirit moves you  
And it fills you through and through  
Every morning and at the break of day  
Did ye get healed?

Jihad
Slayer
----------------
I have witnessed your death  
I've see it many times  
Your tortured screams  
Your decrypted little mind  
A father's son  
With pathetic eyes that bleed  
Twins in the end  
Begin and let the brothers fall  
  
I will see you burned alive  
Screaming for your God  
I will watch you die again for him  
  
God won't touch what I've done  
He cries upon my feet  
A privilege pain  
Beneath buried are your dead  
On splintered bones I walk  
Sifting through the blood  
Besieged in fear  
Await the coming of the God  
  
I will watch you die again for him  
  
Blood is raining downward  
The stain reflects the sun  
Conquer divide within  
Terrorize the mind  
I have seen the end it's yours  
Rosary in hand  
Your selfish flesh it melts  
Spilling from the sky  
  
I will see you burn alive  
Screaming for your God  
I will watch you die  
  
This is God's War  
God's War  
This is God's War  
God's War  
  
War of holy principles  
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction  
Slit the throat of heaven man  
And let his blood dilute the water  
Bury your dead  
  
Fuck your God erase his name  
A lady weeps insanewith sorrow  
I'll take his tower from the world  
You're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed  
  
This is God's War  
God's War  
This is God's War  
God's War  
Fucking Holy War  
  
Be optimistic, happy and calm  
Show no fear or anxiety  
Smile at the face of God  
And your reward will be eternity  
Holy warriors  
Your patience will be justified  
Everything is for him  
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it  
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers  
Strike above the neck and at all extremities  
For it's a point of no return for almighty God  
God will give victory to his faithful servant  
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy  
The great Satan

Blue Jeans
Lana Del Rey
----------------
Blue jeans  
White shirt  
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn  
It was like, James Dean, for sure  
Your so fresh to death and sick as ca-ca-cancer  
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on air pop  
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know  
That love is mean, and love hurts  
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
Big dreams  
Gangster  
Said you had to leave to start your life over  
I was like "no please", stay here  
We don't need no money we can make it all work  
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday  
I stayed up waitin, anticipatin' and pacin', but he was  
Chasin' paper  
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
You went out every night  
An' baby that's all right  
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side  
Cause I'm a ride or die  
Whether you fail or fly  
Well shit at least you tried  
But when you walked out that door  
A piece of me died  
Told you I wanted more  
That's not what I had in mind  
Just want it like before  
We were dancin' all night  
Then they took you away  
Stole you out of my life  
You just need to remember  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time

White Sun
Doobie Brothers
----------------
Horizon of blue, hills are rollin'  
Walkin' with you through a field of red stones  
I been confused from voices callin', callin' to me  
Where the white sun has shown  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
It's got to be free  
  
The old man is weak, but strength comes from him  
A smile full of youth, and a gleam in his eye  
His garden is green and seems overflowin'  
And his dreams await in his rockin' chair sky  
  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
It's got to be free

Do what you have to

To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue  
And as I rank I want to thank no one  
  
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done  
You helped me around  
My parents put me down  
I never skipped town  
  
I stood my ground  
We kept showin' up  
Drinkin and throwin' up  
Rap was my life  
  
As I was growin' up  
Actin a fool in school no one topped us  
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious  
Drivin a bronco  
  
Runnin my own show  
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes  
And me and Bo got together  
Made sense  
  
Spent many nights in Mt. Clemens basements  
I scratched records and performed a few tricks  
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit

Walkin around like a big shot  
'Cause I'm Kid Rock  
Smooth as an ice cube  
  
Cool as an igloo  
And more complex, than a rubix cube  
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue  
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run  
  
And as I incline through time to get mine  
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line  
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep  
The one who finds is the one who seeks  
  
So I sought and fought  
And a lot I got taught  
And although I left those who stole got caught  
Many shows I rocked  
  
Many suckers I laughed at  
And those who snapped back usually got slapped  
The cat if I was strap  
'Cause I was a son of a gun  
  
Livin' life on the run  
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none

Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed

Used, abused, but I paid my dues  
And now no one out there could fill my shoes  
And my pants and do this dance  
This shit didn't happen by chance  
  
It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick  
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip

Lucy it's time for bed now, and you need your rest  
So lie down in your coffin dear, and sleep tight  
I'll wake you when Daddy's here, alright?  
No no don't don't cry little girl

You better do as I say  
Dear Mr. Mayor, welcome to my humble tomb  
Come inside, you know you have to

Long Black Veil
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
Ten years ago on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed beneath the townhall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me  
  
The judge said "son, what is your aliby?  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die."  
I said not a word, though it meant my life,  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  
Oh, she walks these hills in a long black veil.  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail.  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.  
  
Oh, now the scaffold is high, eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear  
And sometimes at night when the cold winds blow  
In a long black veil she cries over my bones.  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.  
  
Oh, she walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.  
  
Nobody knows. nobody knows, but me.  
Nobody knows but me.

The Man Upstairs
Patsy Cline
----------------
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
'Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He will always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Now don't you run and hide  
'Cause if you ever need a friend  
He'll be there by your side  
Just turn your eyes to Heaven  
And say a simple prayer  
Through the clouds of lace  
You'll see his face  
No matter when or where  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
'Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He will always see you through  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He's always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Well don't you run and hide  
'Cause if you ever need a friend  
He'll be there by your side  
If you talk to the man upstairs

Fifteen Minutes
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
(kirsty maccoll)  
Seven times in seven days  
I've sat and wished my life away  
I know the greyness comes and goes  
But the sun don't shine  
And the snow don't snow  
There's suzy-ann with her tits and curls  
Where mediocrity excels  
For those vicious boys and their boring girls  
You know it makes me sick but it's a bozo's world  
Then there's always the cash  
Selling yourself for some trash  
Smiling at people that you cannot stand  
You're in demand  
Your fifteen minutes start now  
City banker looks are in  
The heartless heart, the chinless chin  
And you'd spill your beans for just a pint of gin  
How you got so holy  
And became so thin  
In Sunday papers every week  
The silly words you love to speak  
The tacky photos and the phoney smiles  
Well it's a bozo's world and you're a bozo's child  
Then there's always the cash  
Selling yourself for some trash  
Smiling at people that you cannot stand  
You're in demand  
Your fifteen minutes start now  
Then there's always the fame!  
Autographs now and again  
People who saw you on blankety blank  
Or in the bank  
Your fifteen minutes start now

Run Like Hell
Pink Floyd
----------------
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.  
You better make your face up in  
Your favorite disguise.  
With your button down lips and your  
Roller blind eyes.  
With your empty smile  
And your hungry heart.  
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.  
With your nerves in tatters  
When the conch shell shatters  
And the hammers batter  
Down your door.  
You'd better run.  
  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.  
You better run all day  
And run all night.  
Keep your dirty feelings  
Deep inside.  
And if you're taking your girlfriend  
Out tonight  
You'd better park the car  
Well out of sight.  
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat  
Trying to pick her locks,  
They're gonna send you back to mother  
In a cardboard box.  
You better run.  
  
"Hey, open up!"  
"Hammer, hammer"

Down
Blur
----------------
You and me we try  
cambiar
  
We try so hard it's all the same  
I'm just waiting for it to begin again  
Ahhhh  
I'm forgetting who I am  
That makes me wonder who I am  
Trying so hard to find sense when there's none at all  
Ahhh  
Down  
Staring at the sun all day  
If you stare too long you get burned away  
Now there's nothing left of me so have it all  
Ahhh  
Forgetting again I blame  
My past has just faded away  
Now I can tell you everything there is to know about  
Ahhh  
Down

Awake
Josh Groban
----------------
A beautiful and blinding morning  
The world outside begins to breathe  
See clouds arriving without warning  
I need you here to shelter me  
  
And I know that only time will tell us how  
To carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake to memorize you  
Give me more time to feel this way  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
If I could make these moments endless  
If I could stop the winds of change  
If we just keep our eyes wide open  
Then everything would stay the same  
  
And I know that only time will tell me how  
We'll carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake for every moment  
Give us more time to be this way  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
We'll let tomorrow wait, you're here, right now, with me  
All my fears just fall away, when you are all I see  
  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I have you here today  
  
And I will remember  
Oh I will remember  
Remember all the love we shared today

Liquid Diamonds
Tori Amos
----------------
Surrender then start your engines  
You'll know quite soon what my mistake was  
For those on horseback or dog sled  
You turn on at the bend in the road  
I hear she still grants forgiveness  
Although I willingly forgot her  
The offering is molasses and you say  
I guess I'm an underwater thing  
So I guess I can't take it personally  
I guess I'm an underwater thing  
I'm liquid running  
  
There's a sea secret in me  
It's plain to see it is rising  
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds  
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world  
I know she's playing poker with the rest of the stragglers  
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world  
I know she's playing poker with the rest the rest  
And if your friends don't come back to you  
And you know this is madness  
A lilac mess in your prom dress  
And you say  
  
I guess I'm an underwater thing  
  
I go I go inside her shell  
I see it so and you're doing oh so well these days  
You do it again and I say it's coming back again  
Something like the saturdays such was it  
Can you bring me those jeans  
Keep it back daddy's done preaching in to himself  
Keep it just between us  
It's liquid  
Liquid  
Liquid

These Chains
Toto
----------------
Everybody keeps talkin' about you, I can't lie anymore  
Been too long, what went wrong? It's a mystery  
Why you ever walked out that door  
What direction should I go? Girl what's next for me, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it gonna get easier than tryin' to break these chains around my heart  
Oh oh  
Does it ever get easier, without you I can't pull these chains apart  
Oh oh  
  
I see your face when I look in the mirror  
I feel your touch but you're not there  
Wakin' up, had enough of this dream of mine, girl this just isn't fair  
What direction should I go? Girl what's next for me, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Day by day, until they break, oh oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]

86
Green Day
----------------
What brings you around?  
Did you lose something the last time you were here?  
You'll never find it now  
It's buried deep with your identity  
  
So stand aside and let the next one pass  
Don't let the door kick you in the ass  
  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
Don't even try  
  
Exit out the back  
And never show your head around again  
Purchase your ticket  
And quickly take the last train out of town  
  
So stand aside and let the next one pass  
Don't let the door kick you in the ass  
  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
Don't even try  
  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
Don't even try

Save The World
Yolanda Adams
----------------
Looking at the news today is a cold depressing thing we see our nation stained  
And the whole worlds up in flames. People starving all over the land what a
bajo
Down dirty shame and abroad we see the same we have our selves to blame. Well  
It's been said that we should share what the master gives to us well the time  
Has come to help someone less fortunate than us.  
(chorus)  
Save the world, feed the hungry people, clothe the little babies, lend a  
Helping hand.  
Save the world, feed the hungry people, show them we love and care.  
I took a walk into town this morning a beggar followed me he said he needed  
Food to eat and spare some change please. I took him into the closest grill
y
Paid for all he could eat it warmed my heart as he said thank you ma'am to me.  
Well it saddened me as walked a little further just to see that there is more  
Than one on every corner without a place to sleep.  
(chorus)  
We've got to feed the hungry mind soul and body shelter feed and cloth
todos
With much as we can please stretch out your hand.

Keep On Walking
Passenger
----------------
Well last night I couldn't sleep  
I got up and started walking  
Down to the end of my street  
And on into town  
Well I had no one to meet  
And I had no taste for talking  
Seems I'm talking my whole life  
It's time I listen now  
  
Well I walk past the late night boys  
With their bottles in their doorways  
And I walk past the business men  
Sleeping like babies in their cars  
And I thought to myself oh, son  
You may be lost in more ways than one  
But I have a feeling that it's more fun  
Than knowing exactly where you are  
  
Like a stone carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Well I keep on walking  
Oh, I keep on walking  
Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love, comes to finds me  
  
Well I walked into the morning  
And felt that warm sunlight forming on my shoulders  
'Cause it hit me with no warning  
Like a summer sky storming in my lungs  
Ain't it funny how the kids walk by  
They'll do anything to make themselves look older  
While the women spend their money  
On anything that makes them look young  
  
Like a stone carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Oh, I keep on walking  
Oh, I keep on walking  
'Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love, comes to finds me  
  
Oh, lo, no  
Oh, oh, oh, no  
Oh, lo, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Well I'm like a stone,  
And I'm carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Oh, well I keep on walking  
Oh, well I keep on walking  
'Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love, comes to finds me

One, two, whatcha gonna do?  
Can you come and see me tonight?  
Black, white, feel alright  
if you could in broad daylight.  
  
If I could get to see her  
you know I'd try to please her,  
oh my Ko Ko.  
Don't try to ask me why,  
she set my soul on fire,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue,

You're hot, the cold, I'm rollin' low,  
jukin' down to twelve midnight  
on ice cream, you know what I mean.  
I think I got flavor you'll like.  
  
If I could get to see her

Don't try to ask me why,  
she set my soul on fire,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue,

Ding Ding Licky Licky Licky Bong
Lucky Dube
----------------
It seems like it only happened yesterday  
Now that I think about it  
Tears cannot bring you joy  
But joy can bring you tears  
Even though I cry today  
I will not hide it  
It is for a different reason  
That is why I'll shout it out  
For the world to hear  
I say, "Hello, hello happiness  
Oh Jah, thank you  
For another day"  
I say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
I say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Another tear drop falls  
But I don't care  
I took a wrong turn in life before  
But I've paid my dues  
Objects in the rear view mirror  
They appear closer than they are  
If you don't talk the talk  
Don't walk the walk  
If you won't please, don't tease  
Another lesson learned  
I'm gonna shout it out again  
"Hello, hello happiness  
Oh God, thank you  
For another chance"  
There is no future in the past  
So shout it out  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
They say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Hey Ringo come and dance with me  
Come on, come on  
Rasta  
Come and spend my shoes  
Hey Greek women

MONDAY  
WRITER SONNY BONO  
  
  
Monday knows what it's all about  
She's the kind of girl that can do without  
She was mature at sixteen years  
She grew up fast she was raised on tears  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
Her ma was wind and her pa was rain  
She made her home in an empty train  
Her clothes were patched  
And shoes were worn  
She played with the sun  
And fought with the storm  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She bought a book and learned to read  
So no one could learnt what she heard  
She even ate a hershey bar  
To make her kisses sweeter  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She wonder by night  
When the sun was disarray  
Cause every one notice her in the day  
She wrote in her book  
That a flower is good  
But why is a weed so misunderstood  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She learned how to sing  
And she learned how to pray  
She learned it all in one short day  
But she never learned black from white  
She never even learn how to fight  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do

Here I go again  
Just gonna play it like a fool again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
I'm just like a bell again  
You know, I'm starting to ring again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Typically, when I had it  
Treated it like dirt  
Now, naturally, when I don't have it  
I am chasing less and less rainbows  
Here we go again  
I guess, I'm like a fool again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Over you  
Over you

A Corpse Without Soul
King Diamond
----------------
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He taken his toll  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll  
I was walking down among the graves  
I heard a cry, my shadow is gone  
Emptiness in my body, life in the cold  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones  
I saw my soul in a magical haze  
It was all dressed up as corpse in a wedding dress  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now hear my prayer  
Begging for mercy  
I'm just living to die  
Well, I was walking down among the graves  
I heard a cry my shadow is gone  
Emptiness in my body, life in the cold  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones  
I saw my soul, in a magical haze  
It was all dressed up as a corpse in a wedding dress  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll

The Sabbath Stones
Black Sabbath
----------------
Fire and water, wind and rain  
Wings that carry hell in every vein  
World Possessions, endless tears  
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years  
  
World turns slowly, sun don't shine  
Silence stills the air and kills the chime  
Words are poison, passion bleeds  
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds  
  
The time of dreams has turned  
The night is gone and the light shines on  
Where darkness once would hide  
With spirits high, our fears were born  
  
[Chorus]  
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you  
Keep you from a restless heart  
Deceiver of night the stranger that laughs  
Within you, the reason for your restless heart  
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones  
  
Fire and water, wind and rain  
Wings that carry hell in every vein  
World turns slowly, sun don't shine  
Silence stills the air and kills the chime  
  
Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer each step brings fear  
The eyes of they that see have evil stare  
Watch over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And He's the keeper if the Sabbath Stones  
  
What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?  
What hand would strike and watch his people die? What life that takes, what
future did we earn? It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones  
  
What life that takes what future did we earn? It's our mistakes

He's Misstra Know-It-All
Stevie Wonder
----------------
He's a man  
With a plan  
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Playin' hard  
Talkin' fast  
Makin' sure that he won't be the last  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Makes a deal  
With a smile  
Knowin' all the time that his lie's a mile  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Must be seen  
There's no doubt  
He's the coolest one with the biggest mouth  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
If you tell him he's livin' fast  
He will say what do you know  
If you had my kind of cash  
You'd have more than one place to go oh  
Oou... oou... oou oou... oou  
Any place  
He will play  
His only concern is how much you'll pay  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
If he shakes  
On a bet  
He's the kind of dude that won't pay his debt  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
When you say that he's living wrong  
He'll tell you he knows he's livin' right  
And you'd be a stronger man  
If you took Misstra know-it- all's advice oh oh  
Oou... oou... oou oou... oou  
He's a man  
With a plan  
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Take my word  
Please beware  
Of a man that just don't give a care no  
He's Misstra know-it-all (look out he's coming)  
Dum bum bum ba bum bum,  
Dum bum bum ba bum bum  
Bum bum bum bum bum say  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Can this line  
Take his hand  
Take your hat off to the man who's got the plan  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Every boy take your hand  
To the man that's got the plan  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Give a hand to the man  
Don't you know darn well he's got the super plan  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Give a hand to the man  
You know damn well he's got the super plan  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
If we had less of him  
Don't you know we'd have a better land  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
So give a hand to the man  
Although you've given out as much as you can  
He's Misstra know-it-all  
Check his sound out  
He'll tell it all  
Hey  
You talk too much you worry me to death  
He's Misstra know-it-all

Shame
Eurythmics
----------------
Now there's a lifestyle  
With painted lips  
Now there's a lifestyle  
Everybody wants it  
But it don't exist  
  
And I said shame  
In the dance halls and the cinema  
Shame  
On the TV and the media  
Shame  
We loved you  
  
Now there's a lifestyle  
With fashion chic  
Now there's a lifestyle  
Everybody in it wants  
To be elite  
And I said  
"You with yer brand new shoes and  
You with yer greasy hair and  
You with your mother's pride and poetry  
Don't you want to feel the shame?"  
  
In the dance halls  
Can't you feel the shame?  
And the TV  
Can't you feel the shame?  
We loved you  
  
Shame  
In the dance halls and the cinema  
Shame  
On the TV and the media  
Shame  
We loved you  
  
At the Lido and the opera  
Shame  
At the races  
And the theater  
Shame  
We loved you.  
  
And they said all we need is love  
All we need is love  
With the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  
Day after day  
Day after day

See You In Your Dreams
Kiss

The party's over, and baby's in the corner  
She's all alone for the night  
You pick up the phone, you want to go home  
Well dry your eyes, it's alright, it's alright  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
  
When you're in the room, you're home too soon  
You can't get me out of your mind  
And you get in bed, you cover your head  
My letter to you is signed  
And this is what I'm sayin'  
  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight

Folsom Prison Blues
Waylon Jennings
----------------
I hear the train a comin' rollin' round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
Well I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
While a train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone  
Well when I was just a baby my mama told me son  
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns  
Well I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and I cry  
  
Well I'll bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining car  
Probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars  
Well I know I had it comin' I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a movin' that's what tortures me  
  
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine  
Bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
Then I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Crazy, Crazy Nights
Kiss
----------------
People try to take my soul away, but I don't hear the rap that they all say  
They try to tell us we don't belong, that's alright, we're millions strong  
This is my music, it makes me proud, these are my people and this is my crowd  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
Sometimes days are so hard to survive, a million ways to bury you alive  
The sun goes down like a bad bad dream  
You're wound up tight, gotta let off steam  
They say they can break you again and again, if life is a radio, turn up to
diez
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
And they try to tell us that we don't belong  
But that's alright, we're millions strong  
You are my people, you are my crowd, this is our music, we love it loud  
  
Yeah, and nobody's gonna change me, 'cause that's who I am  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights

No Reason For Livin'
Janis Joplin
----------------
( from the soundtrack of the motion picture 'janis' )  
I ain't got no reason to livin', I can't find no cause to die  
Lord, I ain't got no reason for livin', you give me no cause to die  
Lord, I ain't got no reasons for stay here, give me no cause to try  
I got these blues, I gotta find me that middle road  
Well, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care  
Lord, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care  
Lord, I ain't got no reasons to go on, give me no cause to stay here  
I got these blues, I gotta finally know why  
Well, I ain't got no reason for walkin', I guess I'm gonna fall or standstill  
Lord, I ain't got no reason for walkin', guess I'm gonna fall or standstill  
Lord I ain't got no reason for goin', give me no cause to stay here  
I got these blues, lord I gotta finally know why

Stop
Moody Blues
----------------
So you talked to my girl  
When I don't want you to  
Want you to  
Just the thought of you holding her  
When I don't want you to  
Want you to  
Won't do  
No, no, no  
It won't do, no  
¡Detener! ¡Detener!
You're trying to break it up between us  
¡Detener! ¡Detener!
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
So you talk better than me  
And you know, you know it, know you know it  
And if you want to get her from me  
And you know you know it, know you know it  
Won't do, no  
I'm telling you it won't do, no  
  
¡Detener! ¡Detener!
You're trying to break it up between us  
¡Detener! ¡Detener!
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
¡Detener! ¡Detener!
You're trying to break it up between us

Quiet Riot
----------------
You people love our country  
And music in your soul  
Come on and join our army  
'Cause we're fightin' for rock 'n roll  
Now that it's around

I Know You Rider
Grateful Dead
----------------
Well I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone  
Well I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone  
You gonna miss your mama from rolling in your arms  
  
Well I know my baby he's bound to love me some  
Well I know my baby he's bound to love me some  
He throws his arms around me like a circle round the sun  
  
Well I laid down and I tried to take my rest  
I laid down and I tried to take my rest  
but my mind it just kept wandering like some wild geese in the west  
  
I'm going down the road where I get better care  
I'm going down the road where I get better care  
I believe I'll go babe, I just don't feel welcome here  
  
Just as sure as the bird fly in the sky above  
Just as sure as the bird fly in the sky above  
Life ain't worth living if you ain't with the man you love  
  
The sun's gonna shine in my back door some day  
The sun's gonna shine in my back door some day  
The wind's gonna rise and blow my blues away  
  
To love you baby, it's easy as falling off a log  
To love you baby, it's easy as falling off a log  
Wanna be your baby but I sure won't be your dog

Still
Rush
----------------
Trick of the light  
Or just  
A loss of perspective  
Flaw in the grand plan  
Just  
The way it is  
  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
Eso...
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But I've got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirit's released  
But I've got to get there  
  
Lost in an abstract thought  
Dazed and distracted  
Winded yet still I'm caught  
With a fragment of doubt  
Slowed by reflection  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But I've got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirit's released  
But I've got to get there  
  
It's just confusion  
An illusion  
Easily overdone  
Here comes resolution  
Absolution  
  
It's not an illusion  
Not a fiction  
Easily overcome  
Here comes revolution  
Absolution  
  
Trick of the light  
Or just  
Too much perspective  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still

Run Through The Light
Yes
----------------
I asked my love to give me shelter  
And all she offered me were dreams  
Of all the moments spent together  
That move like never ending streams.  
  
Run to the light  
Everything is alright  
Run thro' the light of day  
You run to the light of night  
  
And every movement made together  
Till every thought was just the same  
And all the pieces fit forever  
In the game.  
  
Welcome to the light  
Now everything is okay  
Run thro' the light of night  
You run to the light of day.

The Christmas Song
Randy Travis
----------------
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!

Find A Way
Used
----------------
Lay your head down just for now  
Space fills your mind  
And you dream a while  
The sun floods your room as you drown  
Your lungs full of breathing  
Your true love, believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
One more time to say  
I love you always  
And keeping faith  
Letting love find a way  
  
You've let the stars suck you in  
Hold tight the night's air and breathe again  
Let go and be burnt by the moon  
Your hands full of feeling  
Your true love, believe  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I love you to death  
Could you love me to death?  
I love you to death  
Could you love me?  
Could you love me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One more time to say  
I love you always  
And keeping faith  
Letting love find a way  
Letting love find a way  
Letting love find a way  
Letting love...

Never Gonna Be Alone
Nickelback
----------------
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you.  
Now I'm, wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside,  
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you.  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
You're never gonna be alone!  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone.  
  
And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,  
Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
When all hope is gone  
I know that you can carry on  
We're gonna take the world on  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone  
  
Oh,  
You've gotta live every single day,  
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Don't let it slip away,  
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun  
Every single day,  
May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be there all the way,  
I won't be missing one more day,  
I'm gonna be there always,  
I won't be missing one more day.

Help Me Believe
Kirk Franklin
----------------
"I just want to write you a letter. I have to be very honest with you right
now.  
I don't really know how to say this... "  
  
I wanna believe  
But I'm having a hard time seeing past what I see right now, I see right now  
I wanna be free  
But when I try to fly I realize I don't know how, no one showed me how  
Wish I could see that this mess I'm in will really work out for my good, you
said it would  
So, if you can hear me, can you give me a sign cause I don't feel you like I
should, please if you Could  
My faith is almost gone, I can't hold on much longer, take this cup from me  
  
[Chorus]  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
(I want you to know)  
I wanna believe  
If I never hear I'm sorry I can let it go, gotta let you go  
Cause, it's killing me. Jesus you know how it feels cause you've been hurt
before, don't wanna hurt No more  
I'm trying to hear you speak, but my heart is growing weaker, take this cup
de mi parte
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I've been here before and can't take that hurt again  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
Believe  
Believe  
  
I wanna believe when I close my eyes on this side I'll wake up with you, more
enamorado de ti
And, and finally, you will say my race it is over and my work is through,
cause I believed in you  
I know dark nights will come and some days there'll be no sunshine and you're
too far to see  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

She's Tight
Cheap Trick
----------------
When I'm down I make a call.  
Got the number written on the wall.  
First it's busy then I try again.  
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?  
  
I got the number and it starts to ring.  
I get excited and I start to dream.  
I start to fantasize of memory lane.  
Then she answers and she says right way.  
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone.  
So I got off the phone.  
  
(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time.  
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind.  
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl.  
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight.  
  
I have something got to say to you.  
Amnesia and my train of thought.  
On the tip, tip of my tongue.  
I had a vision when I was young.  
  
You floated in, we floated up.  
Through the window and down the hall.  
I had a smoke and went upstairs.  
Turned the door and opened the key. She spoke...  
I'm on my own, home all alone.  
So I got off the phone.  
  
(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time.  
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind.  
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl.  
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight.  
  
(She's tight.) She's giving me the go.  
(She's tight.) She's giving me the high sign.  
(She's tight.) We'll turn off the lights.  
(She's tight.) Pull down the shades.  
(She's nice, she's tight.) Turn on the cam'ra.  
(She's nice, she's tight.) And getting ready for action.  
  
Turn off the radio.  
Turn on the video.

Hurry Up
Bruce Springsteen
----------------
It's the end of another working day  
Come on and pack your blues away  
Change your clothes, we'll go for a ride  
To the other side  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
Over here it's easier to breathe  
There's a place for you and me  
And there's no devil here to pay  
And come the light of day we pray  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
And together we'll ride the other side  
We'll feel so free, just you and me  
And I'll pray what is due  
Till the night sees us through  
  
And together we'll ride the other side  
We'll feel so free, just you and me  
When this long is day is through  
We will dance in blue  
  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
Hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown, hurry up sundown  
  
It's the end of another working day  
Come and pack your blues away  
It's the end of another working day  
Come on and pack your blues away

Van Morrison

Beautiful vision  
Stay with me all of the time  
Beautiful vision  
Stay ever on my mind with your beautiful  
  
Mystical rapture  
I am in ecstasy  
Beautiful vision  
Don't ever separate me from your beautiful  
  
In the darkest night  
You are shining bright  
You are my guiding light  
You show me wrong from right  
  
Beautiful vision  
Stay ever on my mind  
Beautiful vision  
Stay with me all of the time with your beautiful vision  
  
In the darkest night  
I said you are shining bright  
You are my guiding light  
Show me wrong from right  
  
Beautiful vision  
Stay with me all of the time  
Beautiful vision  
Stay ever on my mind with your beautiful vision  
I can make it  
I can make it  
With your beautiful vision

Venom
----------------
Venus sheds her skin of gold  
Sacrifice her life  
Washes out the demon sleep  
That hides between her eyes  
Walking, watching, wandering out  
Of soul she must pursue in death  
Will she reach you?  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Venus takes the lightning  
And her hair becomes a flame  
With a guise of innocents  
Who learn her unknown game  
Dancing, raining, sorcery  
He's caught between her heat all year  
She's pleased to meet you  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap - demon child  
Flytrap - virgins wild  
Flytrap - angels death  
Flytrap - there's nothing left  
Born without mortal care  
Joyous of flight  
Pleasing to the eye  
Deadly delight  
Venus arguementor  
Torturing my aged soul  
Fighting through the ashes  
Give me back my skin of gold  
Walking, Watching, Wondering  
The soul she has persued in life  
Will she teach you?  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap

Gates Of Babylon
Yngwie Malmsteen
----------------
Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The Gates to Babylon  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
Oh Gates of Babylon  
  
You can see but you're blind  
Someone turned the sun around  
But you can see in your mind  
The Gates of Babylon  
You're riding the endless caravan  
Bonded and sold as a slave  
A saber dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
A saber dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
  
Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The Gates of Babylon  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
Black Gates of Babylon  
The devil is me  
And I'm holding the key  
To the gates of sweet hell  
Babylon

Falling For The First Time
Maroon 5
----------------
I'm so cool, too bad I'm a loser  
I'm so smart, too bad I can't get anything figured out  
I'm so brave, too bad I'm a baby  
I'm so fly, that's probably why it  
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
I'm so green, it's really amazing  
I'm so clean, too bad I can't get all the dirt off of me.  
I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy  
It's so strange, I can't believe it  
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost  
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost  
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?  
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind  
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
I'm so chill, no wonder it's freezing  
I'm so still, I just can't keep my fingers out of anything  
I'm so thrilled to finally be failing  
I'm so done, turn me over cause it  
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
Anything plain can be lovely, anything loved can be lost  
Maybe I lost my direction, what if our love is the cost?  
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost  
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost  
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?  
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind!

It Speaks The Distance
Mazzy Star
----------------
Sometimes my life  
Is just a torch  
They go away  
And come back to me  
It's just no way  
It can be found  
It's a view  
Come on take it  
The touch of your hand  
It speaks the distance  
It speaks the distance  
In your heart  
Behind my life  
There's a silent storm  
It brings a vision  
Into your mind  
It's in between  
All the dark of hearts  
My heart beats and say  
Come on, there's question of why  
There's no question of why  
Beat your door  
To knock it through  
You took his watch  
His solitude  
In my eyes  
It may be  
Behind my eyes  
There's different kinds  
They go away  
And come back to me

My Heart Is Yours
Dave Matthews Band
----------------
When you hold my hand time stands still  
When the love in my pain fills my heart  
It's your love that heals  
  
When I'm feeling this feeling inside  
I know that it's true  
That every single beat of my heart  
Is beating for you  
  
My heart is yours and my love is too  
And I love you with all of my heart  
Which belongs to you  
  
When your stuck and cold  
And loving moves in  
And love is shining bright as the sun  
Gives my soul from a veil  
  
That every little kiss from your lips  
Takes my breath away  
And it's right here  
By your side I will always stay  
  
My heart is yours  
It's where you'll be  
Your the only love of my life  
Your everything to me  
  
My heart is yours  
Is where you'll be  
Your the only love of my life  
Your everything to me  
  
If I love you with all of my heart  
Which belongs to you

Long Hot Summer
Keith Urban
----------------
I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a'coming  
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you  
I'm in deep, falling deep into the picture  
In my mind of everything we're gonna do  
  
Over at the lake and down by the river  
You can feel it start to rise  
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are  
'Cause I need you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
With your feet up on the dashboard now  
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound  
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,  
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down  
  
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time  
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile  
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi  
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head
esta noche
  
[Chorus]  
  
The only place that I wanna be is where you are  
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far  
  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
All I really want is more than this moment right now  
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes  
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go
abajo
  
I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down  
Waiting on the sun to go down  
Hey, yeah oh, I'm loving thinking 'bout you  
I can't sleep, I'm just lying here thinkin' 'bout you

Julia Says
Wet Wet Wet
----------------
And here I go again, through the back streets of my mind,  
It seems my life was standing still,  
Who's sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how I didn't notice  
  
Here we go again, fighting things we never win,  
It seems our love was standing still  
Oh I'm sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how (funny how)  
I don't feel the love,  
I just hear the words,  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know what it's all about  
She doesn't seem to care at all,  
Open your eyes and see  
Love hurts  
  
I won't be fooled again,  
Looking for the dream I couldn't find  
The dream for me was left behind  
Woh I'm sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how (funny how)  
I don't feel the love  
I just hear the words  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know what it's all about,  
She doesn't seem to care at all,  
Open your eyes and see, love hurts,  
Julia please, open your eyes and see  
  
Julia wants to be on her own,  
Sharing her thoughts, she is all alone,  
Dreaming of the things she wants to be,  
Where Julia don't belong  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know, what it's all about  
She doesn't know,  
Julia please open your eyes see  
C'mon Julie open your eyes and see  
She don't know what it's all about  
Julia please, Julia please  
Julia, you don't care at all  
Cause I want you  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Julie, Julie, Julie

First Time I Met The Blues
Frank Sinatra
----------------
The first time I met the blues  
People, you know I was walkin' down through the woods  
Yes, the first time I met the blues  
You know, you know I was walkin' down through the woods  
  
You stopped by my house first, Mister Blues  
And blues, you didn't do me much good  
You, should have heard me beggin'  
Blues, don't murder me  
  
Aw, you, you should have heard me begging  
Mister blues, don't you murder me  
You know, you be with me every morning, Mister Blues  
I just got to know what you want with me  
  
Ah, good morning, good morning, Mister Blues  
I'd like to know what you're doing here so soon  
  
Good morning, good morning, good morning  
Good morning, good morning, Mister Blues  
I wonder, I wonder what you're doin' here so soon  
  
You'll be with me every morning, Mister Blues  
You'll be here every night and every noon  
  
Yeah, Mister Lenny Picket, ladies and gentleman  
Let's give Len a big hand

Roll With You
Europe
----------------
When you feel out of place let me revolve around you  
When your light fades I have the strength to find you  
  
When what you're feeling is too intense  
When the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
When you're so sorry and don't know why  
It came to be a sad time in your life I roll with you we'll get you through  
  
When you shut your eyes I'll show the images you're missing  
When you've heard enough through me you can listen  
  
When what you're feeling is too intense  
And the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
And when you're crawling through all the hurt  
And you can't find a real friend in this world I roll with you  
We'll get you through  
  
When you feel out place  
Let me revolve around you

Blue Christmas
Celine Dion
----------------
I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
  
Won't be the same if you're not here with me  
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'  
And when those blue melodies start callin'  
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white  
  
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't mean a thing, if you're not here with me  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain  
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'  
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white,  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Blast
Kid Rock
----------------
Aww shit!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kid Rock back in this motherfucking house  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
Mothers crying from these shotgun blasts  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
People dying from these shotgun blasts  
  
'Cause I'm rippin', flippin', crippin', like a real one does  
So if your rap's wrapped in jack, sweep it under the rug  
'Cause I'ma go above that, beyond the calls of my fuckin' duty  
'Cause all these corney, phony emcee's now a days don't move me  
So I'm a show it proof G, so make waves  
I got a full time pay, start to dig graves  
Because I'm buryin' emcee's, and sharin' their ladies  
Now you rolled hoes are carrying my babies  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
A broken home always hurts someone  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
I saw kids get shot, don't sell guns  
  
And still I rip it, flip it, grip it like a real one does  
Rockin', shockin' on the stage, with a hell a steady buzz  
From a 5th of ol' Jimmy Beam  
We fryin' emcees up just like some motherfucking Jimmy Dean  
Sausage pattys, and smoking cabbies like it's no thing  
Drinkin' more Colt's then the 45 king  
Swingin' emcees like a cow hands rope  
And if the guns too loud, oh boy, I'm straight slittin' throats  
  
'Cause that's the way I like to do shit, holmes  
Every time I get my gamble on  
Yeah that's the way I like to do shit, holmes  
I never stay in one spot, i was born to roam  
Feel like I got bank, but it's not enough friend  
'Cause I want more bank see, than my grandkids could ever spend  
So if ya need some cheap slut, then speak up  
Most hoe's know not to ask for cash, 'cause I'm a cheap fuck  
  
[Chorus]

Mystery
Modern Talking
----------------
Oh - love is a mystery  
Oh - love is a mystery  
  
She was the sister of Margarita, it was long long ago  
And I told her that I need her, so much she would'nt know  
And her brother was Juanito, he was a friend of mine  
And I told him that I missing her, but she has no time  
And I said Marie amore, you're the girl I adore  
  
Love is a mystery, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
It's like history, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
  
It's ending on the floor, in the heat of the night  
With the hands in the air and I hold her tight  
And the "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
I know this girl is a mystery  
  
I drank a lot of cool tequilas, should I go or should I stay  
My heart told me I need her, but I'm too shy to say  
I drank a lot of Caipirinhas, I was walking like on air  
And I told her that I love her, baby on I swear  
I said Marie amore, you're the girl I adore  
  
Love is a mystery, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
It's like history, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
  
It's ending on the floor, in the heat of the night  
With the hands in the air and I hold her tight  
And the "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
I know this girl is a mystery  
  
Oh - love is a mystery  
Oh - love is a mystery  
  
Love is a mystery, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
It's like history, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
  
It's ending on the floor, in the heat of the night  
With the hands in the air and I hold her tight  
And the "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
I know this girl is a mystery  
  
Oh - love is a mystery  
Oh - love is a mystery

Embers
Owl City
----------------
There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive  
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes  
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive  
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark and the fire brought me to
vida
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can
quedarse vivo
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
morir
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
And you'll find, there'll be mornings when the ashes and embers are cold  
But you'll fight with a passion and you'll never stop 'cause you know  
Yeah you know it gets better and your story is yet to be told  
Every push, every shove, every war, every love  
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow  
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can
quedarse vivo
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
morir
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
Don't let the fire die  
It gets better  
Just don't let the fire die, no  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
morir
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
Don't let the fire die
