And start from scratch
Here's your sun rising
You want to feel empty
And be filled with strong love
And it does not matter to you whether good or bad
There will be later.

I assure you that when you fall, you will have a warm home
Please come back from a dishonest way without a value that no wise man will follow

Now I really can not do without the aide

We woke up, broken on the ground
And in that house where the two of us sat
And we silenced words that we could have said
Now it's an empty room
Why do we deserve it
And how come we did not see it coming
-----------
And it waited for children in the courtyard
And for a tree to climb and to rest in its shade
In the beginning there was love
And after it sorrow was created
And the tears and the broken heart
And after them came consolation
-----------
We'll stay all night
And I'll whisper words to you
So that you'll know that I'm yours
And in the morning you'll see that we'll stay together
Walking this road
Hand in hand forever

To live until the last moment
To dance with all one's strength
And it sees that time has passed, and we were started
The time that vanished, everything was washed to the sea
And we are less naive and less awake at night

If you already leave then leave it behind
And knowing that everything will change again
And now is the time so you are no longer waiting
If already then with all the strength against this world
If you knew then that you had given everything

Then the whole world calms down
To breathe her in deeply
To know that always
I will be there for her

Blame the world for their loneliness

Standing on the sidelines
Observing the smallest details
No good reason to wake up now

For another day close to you
For another day in your arms
Even if I sit under the sun
I will not burn her horns
Like my heart burned in the flames of your love

You'll always know, always with you
This does not mean that this is the case
It's just a storm on a passing day
And then you'll see how the sun shines
I'll come back to you from the pouring rain.
Even if it's hard for me ...

So come and stand for a moment
Now close, now close
A shooting star is close to us
And again prayers are given to him
A light of hope surrounds us

I'm with you now
Quiet around
What do you think about when you're not listening?
A leaf carried in the wind
Falling on the path
Sitting together and quiet around.

I'll be back soon
At the end of the road stop
To the street and the house
I'll be back soon
The last door to close
Then fall into your arms

You would see that I was already whole
And the truth is that she does not remember anymore
Where this time has passed
I learned to hold on
Forget about everyone

And there are hours filled with her smell
And most of the time she would stay
And when she was not crying
And if so or otherwise
I stay her

In my bed for weeks I asked ...
You are beautiful, my wife and your lips are a second thread ...
You are my beautiful wife, I was stolen from both of your eyes
Which burn me like fire

You were carried on the wing of a big bird

Keep your voice from crying
There is hope for your end
Just keep your voice from weeping and your eyes tear

Evening falls again and it's getting late
Return to my room

Look close comes a happy day.
You are beautiful ...

There is nothing to think when he says, There is no more beautiful time,
Bring the day ...

Do you know what our eyes look like?

And make some noise
Maybe somewhere else
A place more burning
Start a little spoil
And fix it again

Who knows, who knows
And if the taste tastes a bit bitter and burning in the chest
Then everything will wait
You're here, there's more time and everything will change
You'll probably see
If you ask then the heart will answer

If you go who will hug me like that
Who will hear me at the end of the day?
Who will console and relax
Only you know
And if you go to whom I will wait at the window in a holiday dress
Let him come, hug me like that, as you come
