Derech Hashalom

Tel Aviv in time before dark,
The wind is refusing to bark

and the humidity is choking me
in a cafe they haven't turned off the key
on an old chair she is sitting alone


im not sure what to remark,
if i should even approach, or disembark,
im not sure what to spill,
if i should even approach, or chill,

wind is blowing from the sea 
she is looking at me 
and inviting me to sit

she orders a latte for 2 and complaining about the heat
so hot maybe we should fleet? 
living in a rented home
realy close to "derech hashalom",
tonight we are not paying the check


tel-aviv after midnight going up a stairway
pulling out keys and opening a doorway, 

a small table and a bed
she asks me what i want to spread,
a small table and a site
she asks me what i want to bite,
i feel like inside a movie

2 glasses on the table 
and she keeps on enable

opens another bottle of wine 
and throws me a little sunshine,
opens another bottle of liquor 
and throws me a little flicker,
slowly she enters my heart


she orders a latte for 2 and complaining about the heat
so hot maybe we should fleet? 
living in a rented home
realy close to "derech hashalom",
tonight we are not paying the check

with everything that's happening between us
she turns on the air conditioner because of the fuss,
oh the heat maybe we should go to the bedroom.

if you want you can stay here to sleep,
what sleep 
tonight we don't give a bleep

tel-aviv before midnight, 
the wind doesn't want to blow
and the humidity is choking me
in a cafe they haven't turned off the lights
on an old chair she is sitting alone
 
im not sure what to say,
if i should even approach, or withdraw
wind is blowing from the sea 
she is looking at me 
and inviting me to sit
 
she orders a latte for 2 and complaining about the heat
so hot maybe we should go? living in a rented apartment
realy close to "derech hashalom" (name of a street), tonight we are not paying the check (also meaning not giving a fuck)
 
tel-aviv after midnight going up a stairway
pulling out keys and opening a door, a small table and 2 couches
she asks me what i want to drink, i feel like inside a movie
2 glasses on the table and she keeps on pouring
opens amother bottle of wine and throws me a little smile, slowly she enters my heart
