Even if walls fall and you will not be near I will manage alone
Before you go, you will know no shame in escaping from reality
How much you know my love and I was also ready for you to die
And my mother always says you're a delusional type
She does not understand that here alone my heart is divided
Good to know you're getting stronger
-----------
If you lie to me, maybe I will
Let me give me more
When you get close to me it makes me feel good
Again she whispers that it's worth a sweet frenzy
Coming up to me is doing me good
Whispering that you should feel drunk again
-----------
And the tears are not happy
And if you want to bloom, run away
Because everything is in my possession
And if you want to rejoice, run away
Because I'm so upset
What it is to be in love with you
-----------
All night long we talked so we did not want to go to bed
And today he swears that he loves you no less than ever
For me this whole world you had to say
How do I love you here now for me This is my whole life Look at me and you'll see everything in my life I no longer have words
And today he swears that he loves you no less than ever
For me you're all this world to me I had to say
-----------
Come to me, tell me goodbye
Look at my book, leave a place
Come and take the silence
And if you do not know when, you'll come today
Do not be hard for me, you're like a diamond
I will not let you go again
-----------
Day and night, day and night is so excited about you
I only have you, and I'm yours
Day and night, night and night excited about you
I only have you, you are for me and I am yours
Day and night, day and night is so excited about you
Day and night, day and night is so excited about you
-----------
Where I did not look, I lost track of you
In prayer I raised my eyes to the heavens
Come back to me help me Gd
Do not make a mistake
I want you so badly, it's hard for me without you
Sad and bad in my soul
-----------
But you choke quietly, choking me with love,
Burning, she says, maybe it's not on purpose and with you something happens to me,
What is what happens to me because of you, you know that I love you
But you choke quietly, suffocating me with love
Burns, says, maybe it's not on purpose and with you something happens to me
What is what happens to me because of you, because of you
-----------
Drifting lost, when you wake up and know
She drifts after him and kisses his lips,
I do not know that all this is in vain. The guy is not in love
Oh girl, drifting like a child, in love wants to live
In his arms to be, like a child
Drifting lost, when you wake up and know
-----------
I feel like walking and putting on a ring,
Because all your friends are crazy you know
I want to hug you to be always your most want only to you, to you
Because I already feel like going to the sea to put a ring on you
Because all your friends drove me crazy, you know, I feel like it
Embrace you to be always your most want only to you, to you
-----------
Only you and I will burn the whole world, Olla, Olla, Olla, Olla
Give a sign with your eyes in your hands
Do not whisper anything that will not be with you tonight
Give a sign with your eyes in your hands
Do not whisper anything that will not be with you tonight
Do not tell me no, do not tell me no, do not tell me no
-----------
But she still fantasizes and gently suggests
The suitcase is packed, how I feel about Milan
Get in, put it in, put it in your pocket
Pamper, pamper, pamper, heart pounding
You will only let her buy clothes and presents
Load, load, load, Thank You And Let Me Kiss
-----------
And everyone thinks that living my life is the most fun in the world,
It's a bit more than perfect So right thank God,
Thank God I have no complaints,
it's not easy to be simple,
But more than that, it is not easy to be a human being
It rains outside and comes back from another performance
-----------
Try to believe, forgive, understand
I want you to return to my life
Trying to come back while imagining maybe you're here
What I did I let you go
Try to believe, forgive, understand
I want you to go back into my life
-----------
Games of honor separated us
It will not work for everyone you will testify I loved you
As no one can
Companies you told things I did
They lied and destroyed everything I built
You've been a big disappointment
-----------
Please turn, take my voice, this is our life.
I can not leave,
I can not give up, what do you want from me?
It's our life.
Who took your heart to me, I alone so sad,
Please turn, take my voice, this is our life.
-----------
There is no one to love you like me, no one to love
I'll find ways to grow flowers in the middle of the desert
Even when the night is cold I stay
I will go through days to download rain in the middle of the fern
There is no one to love you like me, no one to love
There is no one to love
-----------
Hey, he walks away
From your home, it's me going
All night long I did not fall asleep turning from thoughts
What goes through your life and under the blankets
If I hurt you a little girl if I hurt sorry
All I wanted was love
-----------
Your shadow is always chasing me, disturbing me again
All I need is to forget about you
It's dangerous, give you my heart
It's dangerous, you'll suddenly go and ignore it
Like a child smashed in front of you, I can not take any chances again
I can not let the heart again suffer while you lean on his shoulder
-----------
Send it back to me, to me, every day taking care of her well being
A few tears, a few hopes, sitting alone in my room and asking
I have no days, no nights, every corner that I pray
Give it back to me, give it back to me
Give it back to me, give it back to me
Before the rain washed away my life
-----------
My Queen is my unit and how much you are for me, beautiful for you to be happy
My Queen is my unit and how much you are for me, beautiful for you to be happy
My queen is my unit and how much you are for me
Beautiful you just be happy just love more every day it just overcomes
We have time so early so do not be late
Loneliness that evades the room is no longer cold and there is nothing
-----------
We've even started talking about a wedding
Now I got out of the frame of the picture and he got in my place.
It does not fit what you did
What you did was not appropriate
It does not fit what you did
What you did was not appropriate
-----------
I exchanged love in a rhythm
Like the world champion in escaping
Like one who is afraid of sadness
How easy it is to fall in the evening
When there is no one to lean on
And for a moment you passed me here without meaning to
-----------
I will ask your God about the captives
Prisoners, captives
I will ask your God about the captives
Prisoners, captives
He would pick up his arms, gather up his arms
He would pick up his arms, gather up his arms
-----------
If I gave up already, then why does it hurt
You find the answer
Tell me what love is.
Let me love you, hold you tight
Give me the path that will lead into your heart
My soul wants to fall in love with you, to walk blindly on your way.
-----------
I count the years, brother Mamma Mia
Black curls, falling on the shoulders
Like two pearls, beautiful are the eyes
Small dimples, and even a shapely nose
And lips of all good
And how beautiful you are Mama Mia
-----------
On the one hand you love
On the other hand, you're afraid.
Stay, stay, please,
Stay, stay close to me
Do not leave, do not give up,
Think of me
-----------
He was suddenly too alone
Go back to the passing hours and miss the already
What a quiet day
You came with me or did not ask about the beach
And I chose only to be afraid
Everything could have been ..
-----------
How then would we all just do
Now they do not like together anymore
Go home already
My heart goes wild and it's hard for me to sleep
Go home already
Tired of alone can no longer
-----------
Here it happens, so no word
Saturday of football - now begins
Everyone understands, everyone offers
This is in front of the screen, and it is from the gallery
Here it happens, so no word
Saturday of football - now begins
-----------
Now I'm dying
And only, just misses.
No longer afraid or hesitant
I want to make peace
Come back, I'm not angry anymore
Just misses
-----------
We are attracted by the opposites
And that may be what keeps us together
And that's why I love you
And that's why I want you
And only because of that, it beats in my chest
Your heart is all yours
-----------
I just wanted to know
Always when you touch
You flew high in the air
I wanted to tell you
I promise you
Everything I wanted to say
-----------
You can not know without you
The way you approach me
There's a fire here that lights me
How my heart connects to yours
And I only want you
Can not without love
-----------
Take me into your life
Say, we can continue
I have feelings for you
Even if sometimes the heart is unstable
Most of the time thinking about you
And how come you're not with me.
-----------
How happy I am, how happy I am
You have everything
She brings the sun to me
only you
You are my life (the)
You are my poor
-----------
Beit Lecha will be established
Dona Donny, as always stings
Like the queen of bees your love
Invites you but in the end kills
As you build it destroys
Donia, Donnie Donnie Donny ...
-----------
I find it very strange that you are not with me
The light in front of my beauty
Time goes by not answering
And I carry a prayer
You swear you're never mine
I'll tell you my soul is crying
-----------
And if my door is locked with generosity
I opened my door to you and opened it
And all the heavens are lights and stars
Your voice is surrounded by thousands of bells
And you, Ofra
With all the angels
-----------
But a heart that hurts never forgets
Until when her mother cried and sobbed
Sa'ida, another mother, Sarah
Saida, hope and dream
You are part of my father and also part of my mother
Saida, a mother's soul
-----------
I'm fighting for you again
You wish me all the best
You like games
I dream of the universe with you
In the middle of heaven
Sounds good to me
-----------
Get me high
Into your world
Let me fill in the blanks
What you do not have
With respect to both of us
It's never
-----------
Every day anew, looking for the honey
In your lips
Exploding because of you, just tell me how
Talk to you
No robber was not a thief, all in love
take me to You
-----------
Who loves you
Drop over everyone
Always remember
Looking at you from the side
Like a guardian angel
Do not be alone
-----------
We'll be stripped of olive oil
And we'll go back to the old days.
May it be so
That on several nights without a home
We'll go to other days and see
A dove with an olive leaf.
-----------
I'm here alone holding out a hand to you
So come on, come to me.
Waiting for you and lingering
Waiting for you, maybe you do not know
I'm here alone holding out a hand to you
So come on, come to me.
-----------
Words carved on water
I was a stranger too, I trusted you, I will not miss you
Anani, from a besieged siege city
Clouds of silence
I am the man who desires life
Quick to save me
-----------
Jerusalem of gold, you are ill.
Who will drive the demons?
This is the Betar army
Who is the Queen? Who is the champion?
Beitar Jerusalem, the yellow at the top
And to you I swear, the love of my life forever with you ...
-----------
embrace...
And who will save us?
We do not know where we came from
And where we go from here
Crying into the sky, the water is already exhausted
Here we can smile again
-----------
I did not ask for palaces
No roses wrapped in silence
Give me some of you
I have no more room to sit with you in the living room
You look at me, you look at me, I can not see
She is silent
-----------
With you everything is real
And you say you
Always loves slowly
Always stealing a look but you do not remember
And again the night is over, it's not too late
And the dance that is left whispers to you not to go
-----------
Time has taught me that love is not only a taste
It's a job, it's a bit of running away
Maybe we did well, maybe we were wrong in the elections
We also learned to hurt and insisted on loving
Either way, I love you
Either way, I love you
-----------
So do not leave
Do not ever leave
Now someone with your smell has passed
I thought I was falling
I thought I was falling
On your knees
-----------
And for a moment he broke off
And I wish I would suffocate
what?? I did not understand
I said go away
Ahhh
So take flowers
-----------
More in the lower legs and buttocks because it's samba
Outside playing it cold inside I lava
How the heart goes wild
She turns the body she drinks too
Instead of dancing, she turns around and does it on me
Flavera does, I think it's a bull on me
-----------
Tell her what they say and do not hurt
It's not you, it's me
So let's get a little pressured, life is beautiful - live, why talk?
And if you are for me, as you say: "It's written by my lover do not go, I'll be where you look
So maybe look at me, look at me, tell me, tell me
Look at me and you will look at me until night falls.
-----------
How did you go?
And the fears that will disappear from my memory
With the days just do not forget it's me
That you loved how you went?
Damn it, I think about my death
You are the only one who has seen me and succeeded
-----------
Stay you can not find you, can not find me
How can you forget your heart
How can I live from here?
How can you forget your voice saying "Mami Come eat on the table"
Today I know you're not mine
And it's clear to me that you will give me everything
-----------
Life is beautiful You told me and fell asleep slowly, so I sing to you
We saw beautiful places day and night. I saw you
We would step on the floor, we would touch the ground
And sometimes even far away
When we were together, you liked to tell me in a hoarse voice
How in this crowdedness of togetherness we have not tired yet
-----------
And joy will caress the eye A little more happiness will flood to the roof of your house More heaven will give me fruit Every Shabbat you light candles A little more built us a house full of children
And if today I'm tired of your look, I will be overwhelmed by strength, and if your hand touches me slowly, I will also have the walls of pain that were in me,
A little more vineyards will turn into wine
And how in your voice you touch me, again the distance disappears into the night If you put your hand on my heart You will understand more One moment that you are not me again Twistling, nothing knows Do not go today,
And if today I'm tired of your look, I will be overwhelmed by strength, and if your hand touches me slowly, I will also have the walls of pain that were in me,
A little more vineyards will turn into wine
-----------
Not that you allow it to develop anywhere, for you it can continue to dream
But why you, why do you think Lili? Go know ...
Look at you, suddenly in love
With all the difficulty of breathing and the familiar pressure in the chest
See you in love more suddenly, you're not grown up
You're not for that
-----------
How much you know how to love, and it makes me so good in my heart
Let me know, I love you like that
I see you more than anything else with me
Let me know, I love without fear
And you know how to put everything aside and love
How much you know how to love, and it makes me so good in my heart
-----------
I hope that in the middle of a gray day
In the car or just in front of the screen
You stop and hear this song is yours
I do not want you to think I did not try
I just can not say
My heart left your song remains
-----------
From here I told you agree, but it hurts when it comes to distances
In the distance you are silent, silent to me
I did not imagine at night that my heart hurts so much
I did not think about the day you're his, that I'm so and so not
But thank God it's a little bit for me, the pain today is time for the medic
But it's clear that evil also has an end so I'm not afraid
-----------
If your smile suddenly big and the thrill of stopping also eat
You know, to get into my heart before you I have not given any more
Ecoute chéri, arrête ce jeu là.
Je m'appelle Mag et tu sais les files
comme moi ... font tourner
la tête des mecs comme toi.
-----------
What a world What a world What a world
It is not easy to be with her in front of everyone
How much power does she have on me?
what a world
And she says to me like flowers
She does not need too much
-----------
Do not go to my memory for a second
And the hug from you will be the way you loved it.
And if possible until my last day
You'll be just as beautiful as you were born
Do not go to my memory for a second
And just come home
-----------
Then autumn will caress like the wind
Not summer, not summer at all
You will not come here and you stay to rest
She will not come this summer, she will not come
God will not come
The days of Tammuz will pass and she will not come
-----------
Our son is not worth anything to me if I have
Everything and I have no love within the body
And there is no longer in the world like a family
And all that love lets me fly if he chooses
The whole world let his soul forget the pain
Then you would know I had you
-----------
Dad for everything thank you
Wherever you go
You will know the way to the light is
To smile and grow up only to God
Lock your heart
For your lovers
-----------
Tell each other the truth
Sometimes the distance is like touching
He builds he builds is forgetful
Everything promises to let you take off the sun
And I'll put a moon there where we go
So let's talk
-----------
Everyone will tell you you worry for no reason
Everyone is his but he is with you
We knew that long ago
Everyone will tell you if you knew
So how happy his angel was
If you were more understanding
-----------
Say how I want you
Dance with you all night
Maybe you'll tell me to hang out again
Tell me maybe we'll drink whatever you want here
Tell me just say come
Say how I want you with me here
-----------
I keep the words you throw away
You make a point of nothing when I forgive
You always talk between silences
Whenever you choose to give up I stay
And then it absorbs you
She whispers regrets
-----------
Suddenly it happened
I almost got used to making one
Almost my worries were about my future and how to live with fear
I actually began to realize that human beings are not a creature of togetherness
Suddenly it happened
Already too many years ...
-----------
And know you love
I know you're sending me
In all kinds of forms at home,
And if you were now everything was complete,
In dreams the heart opens
When I dream of you, you must
-----------
I feel like living and working a little more at night
The way you walk, I get a bit encouraged
So the Mami thing feels a bit like me,
Although your kindness is a sentimental moment
I'm so happy when you go
Do not die
-----------
It's unbearable and I will not ask you
How did you go through tonight?
I do not know what about you
Yesterday you said you dreamed I was gone
If you only knew how much it turned upside down
And that I do not have a voice singing on you into the night
-----------
I had a moment of deja vu
You asked me: "Have you eaten?"
Maybe we'll go to sleep
You were sitting in a corner
You got a newspaper quietly
You went back to bed stroking my face and laughing
-----------
When another lives in your heart
When another asks for a sweet moment
Just live his life by your side
So I'll break up alone and a little far away
When another grows old beside you
Only then will I break ...
-----------
Like everything you touch, you touched my heart
I know as every story of love remains only a pain
Tell me if it's my whole life or we're done
Or go as you are without words
Tell me if you came to me for a day or you stay
Night for night for night Another night for you with me
-----------
I'm glad you have one to take care of you
Like me and trust only you
Yes I wanted so much to tell you that I have
A friend who loves me sea
He makes sure to raise my head and explain to me
That the broken heart is perfect
-----------
Shout out loud, or
I'm with you now
I'm with you now
I'm here
You're here, with you
Shout out loud
-----------
How everyone always picks her up, they yell at her
She walks down the street
They call her Luca, Luca Luca Luca
Mocha-colored body and so beautiful
They call her Luca, Luca Luca Luca
The way she shines like that from herself
-----------
That you are there without me. You are there without me
No longer want to participate in the game again
Yours, he says brazenly
The sadness increases to the bones and slowly it again penetrates
Gd what a feeling
Night is not broken ...
-----------
For only after darkness does light come to life
Finally comes back to you
You keep me from falling
Do not leave, yell at you
You gave me everything from me
I love you Dad, my big lord
-----------
She passes there glamorous, telling about everything
Connecting to the periphery is good for business
And everyone always tells her: You've won the world
Only at night does he arrive, that pain on the side
And she is among a thousand people, smiling to everyone
And she is among a thousand people, and yet she is alone
-----------
Give only warmth and love
All life lead you
How good it is for me
How many how much does it make me feel good
Only where the heart will take you
I'm with you
-----------
Take her to the sea with a bathing suit sun
Let everyone wait tomorrow
I'll make Salafi with her
Let love waste your time
You'll laugh at the world
You'll laugh at the world
-----------
And if you think that I'm still holdin 'on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm still) holdin 'on (holdin' on) to somethin '
You should go and love yourself
-----------
Left Right Another round at the top
Right and left some buttocks move
Left Right Another round at the top
Popa was popping
How everyone here is dancing like Rio
Popa was popping
-----------
He will make peace in His heights ...
God only wanted to admit
For finding her
Such a soul so twin awaited her
And with her you will come in your canopy
So send them a blessing
-----------
Yours secretly God all over me You know who I am
Even if I laughed even if I stayed away I would still be loyal to you
Because I was distraught and scattered to a million pieces of what I did
And I did not do this God all my strength I drew closer and walked away so I'll call you my father,
God, enlighten me, your face, the father of the luminaries, deep in the soul, in the body of the slime, there is a glimmer of light, and the light of the lights heard my sigh
A sparkling father in the candlestick and in the candles I have given you in my soul All my God before You know who I am
-----------
Sweet on the tongue until the sun passes
With a glass in your hand that cools the body
The music does good in the ears
And it does not bother us to be more crowded someone splashing you with water
The news lenses were on a dry morning
Now you already know that you'd better not see how the one with the pink one is all crazy
-----------
Pardes Hannah, and when the heat came, you screamed
hi Mama
Wants to sit in the living room
The front of the screen is stuck
Just drink whiskey
You play me because it's been a weekend
-----------
How everyone no longer stops in the race of life
Go talk to the wall and the routine suffocates
Why so many hours can be pursued
Every day after happiness he always travels
Come on and let's take some time will not cost us dearly
just me and you
-----------
And so I will come sweating and tired from the honorable journey on my back
And I can finally sleep most of my death.
I remain in the room, staggering in failure
Not goodbye and no peace
Maybe I was passing by in your mind as a short memory
I passed an unfamiliar old man
-----------
Black or white is the big one
And I have nothing to say I've run out of words
I will not write you a message either
That's bigger than life
And why are you suddenly so quiet
Everything falls to me Why tell me why
-----------
If only this time you will forgive again
So we met to heart to heart for the last time
Undress and get dirty and throw away everything that happened
And I kept thinking about you the hardest
On Saturdays even if I wanted to say a word then
I kept silent at night
-----------
It makes me feel good, so come on
Pick up your hands ...
Do not go do not go baby
I will not dance alone. Come give me a hand
Do not go do not go baby
How nice it is. Come give me a hand
-----------
What are you looking for from my mother?
And this city is beautiful and nothing more than it
Apartment overlooks the street
The view of buildings
Even the sun does not look from here to where the sea is
Where did you go back to living with your parents?
