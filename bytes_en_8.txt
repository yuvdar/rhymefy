The father of your eyes sees
I remember the lines
Zmirot Shabat Moed and Holiday
From your Torah that I will not forget
And serve you from generation to generation
I will add the Ark to the psalm
-----------
Your father looks at the reincarnation
You and my child continue to work hard
About great studies and wandering
Hangs very wisely
But on your way to the moments a pillar
The elders in the tribe say ...
-----------
sea ​​of ​​tears...
I'll be back with you so much
Just wait and mine stay
In time, only a single letter sent to me
The pages had long since faded too.
sea ​​of ​​tears...
-----------
Another burglar regrets but late.
wife
My son is still raging at me like a boy
To your garden he yearns to open a gate
And do not hold my head and make up.
Raya, only yesterday we still loved ...
-----------
Sometimes I think
How to love you all night
You're Lee tonight
You're my day
You're Leila ...
Only you want tonight ...
-----------
Such a sweet memory if you have it
One thousand nights
In me the melody is whispering
She fondles little memories
Day to night
Those days are screaming
-----------
I would not ask
Neither treasure nor mine
That way I will know peace and love
And I will be satisfied with the fruit of the garden
I shall not touch the tree of knowledge
And I will never know sorrow
-----------
Please come back please
You broke my heart
Please come back
He can not do without you anymore
Please come back
He can not do without you anymore
-----------
What a cruel and evil world
Out of the mists of earth will
A beloved figure features familiar faces
A violin will sound
Shai has such pleasant memories
Play player ...
-----------
Going to go
That's why you went too
Even before you arrived
I shall carry my feet there
Maybe maybe
And in a hearty valley ...
-----------
We'll do things, too
Which look without reason
You do not need anything
Investigate and ask
Sometimes it is also permissible
Not knowing everything
-----------
Where I lay on my back ...
Every day I wait for the end
Almost Sunday
Monday you're gone
And Tuesday I'm alone
Then I'll lie on my back
-----------
And do not underestimate my feelings
But there was no silence
And my mind was different
The thought of a little girl
That girl I had hoped for
It also caused disappointment ...
-----------
The sweet scent bloomed in my garden.
Since then you have walked a long, dull, dull day
In vain I want to forget and ignore
Quickly return without you a world that is desolate
There were vocal cords and silent violins.
You are my world ...
-----------
A psalm is not to suffer
A song of a mute.
I will not even pray
Alone without a future without hope without a dream
I will not even pray
Alone without a future without hope without a dream ...
-----------
I'm yours and yours
Listen to the sound of love
Understand
If I go
Go with me.
I'm yours...
-----------
Silent is the night and dark
Stars from above also asks
- What 's that girl?
What a little you
What are you dreaming about?
I also dream
-----------
I did everything
Have a good time
For her I left friends
I did everything
Only her to love
And I gave her a lot of songs.
-----------
A girl so sweet to Eleanor
It's a story of disappointing love
Love is so painful
That the end should be good inshallah
to me
I was very disappointed ...
-----------
You will not be able to ...
God sits up in thought
How far you exaggerate the images
How far will you go in images
Look for a star solution
And live forever
-----------
And I will tell you my love
I'm yours and yours
I remember your look
How it is to live near you
And kiss only your hand
And feel the warmth of your heart
-----------
How painful she knew
Short by telling
Mother, mother, mother
How can I thank you, I will not know
Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother
How can I thank you, I will not know
-----------
I asked to return
She closed me
Mother is hard to give me a hand
Maybe I'll come back and not be lost
Mother is hard but I'm destined
That I will return and not be lost
-----------
You too know and go
There must be room
Where they stand still
Where an orphan
Also shed
Supposed to say .....
-----------
The time of the bride uncles
Come to my garden
The grape blossomed
Pomegranate sparks
The grape blossomed
Pomegranate sparks
-----------
I wish I could be home right now,
I wish I could be home right now.
What if we just get up and leave
We do not have to wait for the sunrise
I'm asking you, Cuz laTely I just want to break free
With you
-----------
You know I do not have a moment's rest.
You know I do not have a moment of rest today.
You know I do not have a moment's rest,
You know I do not have a moment's rest.
You know I do not have a moment's rest today,
come in peace.
-----------
It's funny because you'll leave after a few moments
Call me and say they're all dumb
And that you came to me
So for what games
Psychology in the Shekel
And you came to me
-----------
I'll wait for the night,
The days are the same,
For the most part I have no rest and no quiet.
So maybe at night,
I'll wait for him from now on,
Hope that if I stay you stay too
-----------
I'm here when you do not feel like being,
To offer peace and extinguish the fires,
I'm here when the wind blows, when there's no power to live
And when nothing is left.
I'm here to get the blows,
When you have no more strength for yourself and you have to unload
-----------
I do not want to forget anything I record
Sucked into myself reaches to the bottom
And if sadness appears in the distance I wait for him to come and come in like a truck
I will not be one of the old people they tell themselves something and live with him for years
And not everything is black and white, right today all shades
He has a sun waiting for the clouds to spread
-----------
She says if we fall, even if we disappear for a minute, then nothing happened
Even if the entire world gets stuck then becomes new, if it does not work at the end it's just that you do not really want to
She says every day, every day is another matter every day waiting for you and when the noise increases we will just keep quiet
Far from people. I do not need anything.
She says thirty is a lot, good luck from my mother!
And I look a little indifferent to her, ask how I feel and I feel sixty-five.
-----------
The dogs, the fitness room, the clothes of the old man, the stokers of the stoker, the licks in the morning
How else would she be safe?
She wants all the pose of the mini
That the roof be open, the hat that would hide the mood, and a beautiful apartment on Rothschild Boulevard
And that someone would pay the bill
Welcome to the generation has become indecisive
-----------
But it's true first thing I've been lately
Less ready for marriage and love.
So if suitable for you to enjoy but hide,
And ready to experience something else,
You'll be here in 20 minutes, you'll come without emotion
Keep your heart strong, not break
-----------
All the worries and fears when I did not understand that it was all attempts.
I waited for me to grow up, to see if things would stay the same or if there would be any change at all,
And still waiting, and mainly writes about things, that's the only way I will soften you up.
I waited, as the earth waits for water,
Like a child shouting loudly at the sky
And I still wait every day, every day.
-----------
Far from the old pain,
And they will probably ask people,
How we built happiness that grew all the time.
And you tell them at night We always wanted to grow,
We were not frightened, we were not afraid to fall,
So if we end up a bit mad, that's ours
-----------
And she's listening and he says
'I waited for a man like his shadow'
Different faces I caressed and I have no logic,
At the end of the day, I waited for you on the window.
Different faces I caressed and I have no logic,
At the end of the day, I waited for you on the window.
-----------
And she says so well,
Otherwise how will we feel alive.
What am I without you, what am I without you?
What am I without you, what am I without you?
What am I without you, what am I without you?
What am I without you, what am I without you?
-----------
Go, come, just come back.
For I have a world, and it grows with time as you have.
Tired of announcing that he is missing you.
My children, dear, at night I worry about you,
I will not want to interfere or interfere,
Say what I have in life if not you.
-----------
Filled with secrets, Libby is standing in the doorway.
Full of memories that I would take with me forever.
Let's talk about you,
Only you.
Let's talk about you,
Just about you and me.
-----------
Let the whole world wait, and in the meantime everything we dreamed would happen.
We'll throw cliches into the sky
And we will no longer know such sadness.
Tears weaken your eyes
But until the summer comes, the rain will be all cleaned up
And the whole world will wait.
-----------
And they think it's not always right to fight,
So how do we still have no room
Where one can rest.
Because they think that it is not always right to fight,
But we still have no place
Where one can rest.
-----------
And how will you save myself from me again,
There is no one else who can.
Until exhaustion,
Until the legs fail,
I went at night,
Only to you, only to you.
-----------
I will not ask you, you to just desert me
I can not give you, what you think you give me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning ohh
-----------
Right in front of my eyes.
I'm thinking about it.
Let it go, let it go,
It will all fix itself,
I'm thinking about it,
Let it go, let it go.
-----------
A secret, one word after another,
Come and come closer and I'll tell you.
Who is in a storm,
In my house, without ever noticing.
And the fragments are still falling,
Only the silence in your eyes conveys the pain.
-----------
Talk to me more.
And then another time passes,
What were we waiting for him to come for,
If he always comes you stand beside him.
What were we waiting for him to come for,
If he always comes you stand beside him.
-----------
I can not stop
So if the roads will be too long for you
I'll give you a room where you can crash on me
And there you will be exactly what you think you are going to be
And people will say you can go crazy and live exactly the same
And you say you're a bit afraid to try
-----------
And he ran to nowhere
Until the light came out ...
I'm drunk with sounds and breathing tunes
See people built only from letters
I give in to the moments and it does not let me sleep
And when they fall around me I run nowhere
-----------
I am so many figures but find the truth so clear
And returns back
Because I wanted a bit
He admits that at night I always asked
And I'm happy with everything but I still asked again
More
-----------
And what if we move away
I ask you perhaps myself too, because suddenly I am alone in the room
I ask because you are flowing in my blood
And what if we crash
And when I leave you will you remember how much we loved when the rain
Merged with the tears on his face
-----------
Where will we go, and who will know, and only we will not fall.
And do not ask all the questions
And do not tell too many secrets
And I'm here until the lights are turned off
And by the time this screen came down,
There's more to see
-----------
Just know he's watching over you too
You will not give me peace and nothing will help
And wait for the good that he does not return
And the pen will have a weapon and nothing I hide
And I'll write a song about you
And I'll write a song about you
-----------
They clean me so
Dirty again back to my room you prepared for me, the good that is woven in the air gives me a silly smile Oh and how I waited for this moment to sit with me Phoebe, sit with me.
With time I'm a little far away from my own world
You say maybe for another day you'll stay here with me.
And suddenly I'm scared, too, like trees We grow up, and when you reach us, I wanted so much to say
Suddenly I'm afraid, like trees, we grow too. And by the time you came to us, I wanted so much to say
-----------
But if I'm not yours I will not be anyone, how between the mistakes, the promises and the lies, I have nothing in my hand
And me, lately
Look how I live here, leaning on memory
And I did not ask for anything and certainly not too much
Only where will you be when everything falls on me again
And who will be here when I expose my pain?
-----------
Run and shout to run and shout
Take me, I'll do you good
Sit down next to me You know that nothing matters as long as you're here ..
The quiet that burns in you comes out from time to time to see if it is permitted to shout
The melting ice sometimes feels the hard heat from a distance
And if I'm not crazy it's only because your voice cleans me up again
-----------
I'm not mistaken I do not get confused
A little mist that you can not see
Maybe by chance, maybe sometimes
Maybe I'll be something else
Just for me. Today I'm not lying to myself.
And in the room we learn to gamble and smile to lie there is nothing to hide
-----------
I saw everything in your eyes
Today I've been feeling
Nights I passed without you
Days you left me indifferent
I saw everything in your eyes
Today I no longer feel
-----------
Wearing a different face has nothing to do with you to do with you
Conquering thousands of lands where I might live with you ..
After all, he does not give you anything you really need at the end of the day
And since you're all the same with him, you sit and cry
Wearing a different face has nothing to do with you to do with you
Conquering thousands of lands, maybe I'll live with you ... Meanwhile.
-----------
The sun will not go down until the sky decides
And I will not budge until this day is over
You can always shout until you fall off your feet
Maybe we'll love today and deal with it tomorrow
Because you, everything I have, you
Because you, everything I have, you
-----------
And I had to keep hoping
Which at least may hurt you
Like I'm in pain. Ever since you left
And only an idiot will wait for you now
When the rain did not spare his face
I waited for the sun ... to warm up a bit
-----------
So where are you
Think what to say to you and grab your face
On the rain roads I drizzle on 140
It's real. Almost every minute I thought about where you'd be
When reality comes back ... when imagination is over
When reality returns
-----------
Ask you before you go
Where are the best days?
In which we laughed all the time
I sing to you and you remember it
And swore in pain with passion
And in love all that was
-----------
Father will paint a smile on my lips
I will not be in my heart and I will not be angry
Father, forgiving and merciful
Father will win me to give to those who do not
To embrace and to laugh at everyone who is sad for him
Father, faithful father
-----------
I have another love in my life
She told me Chaim
Maybe you'll give us a chance
To love as we loved it is only up to you
I always stayed exactly like the Creator
I thought we had not met by chance
-----------
This night everyone applauds us
So look at me in the poor
If I forget Jerusalem I'll forget my right hand
Who created happiness and joy
Bride and groom, love running and dancing and joy
Peace, peace and friendship
-----------
Every night they fall asleep
The floor is drunk
You can not see her lover anymore
Something was wrong
When I'm in the room
They do not control it and it's temporary
-----------
You hold my hand
Looking at the poor
For days you've had all your heart
So maybe you'll save me a place when I come
And I want to be your whole world
Your whole world
-----------
I heard you were around here
Just come back for a minute
We have built a lot of things that we did not solve
Of the days when you thought I had betrayed you
Days and nights I just cursed you
It's been a month
-----------
How can I get out of this okay? I do not have the strength
Bend and download Thrush swallow and tear
With no other chance of that I know
How can I get out of this okay? I do not have the strength
Download download Thrush swallow and swallow
With no other chance of that I know
-----------
And I was with you and wanted so much
Built a good life
happy life
Dreams break and stare at you from the side
And does not take my eyes off your interest
You were just suddenly like a stranger to me
-----------
Words left on a page
To say is a little too hard
I fought anyway
Now it's lost
I stayed far away
My self is getting lost
-----------
The most precious thing that was mine
I feel like seeing you tonight
Like we used to get drunk in the neighborhood bar
I miss now
Laugh your rolling
I love you so much
-----------
Our pictures are in every corner
It has already become a souvenir
Highway into a dream
You're here with me and smiling
Beautiful children that grow up like a movie
Like in a movie
-----------
Pray about you and me
Asking only good for both of us
I promise to return in two days
Embrace you in my beautiful
Take care of yourself
Be strong for us
-----------
You look again and I come to die
How it comes to you easily
And I was suddenly attracted
When you caress me, there are shivers
You smile carefully
There is nothing like your beauty
-----------
You smashed me into a thousand
Which determines whether it is rainy now
You have planted me planted in me
All that I have desecrated
You made me feel like
That's what you were meant for
-----------
where are you today
I can only dream
Only can dream
About life without you
That I remember your eyes
When I remember your lips
-----------
We walked around the silence
That we had just gone hours without logic
The storm passed and we still did not talk
I planned that in the summer we would run the farthest
I had a thousand plans in mind only for the two of us
Come on, I'll tell you everything
-----------
You want to sleep at night tonight
Spend just spending time
How always you hurry does not stop
And you have a reason all the time
Today I lock the door
And you stay here tonight for the party
-----------
Tell you that it is not easy for me
I'm used to hearing, Mami
Come and sleep with me Come on, late
And my heart was torn
That now you have so happened to me
Waiting for the day you come back to me
-----------
She had a very strange look for a while
How I did not feel the end of love
Every person in the heart has a wish
The angels come to realize it
If only I could explain it to you
He looks at my face and imagines it
-----------
He haunted me all winter
Even the scarf you left me
It was not warm at night
So I hugged all the memories
The truth is that we met, we kissed
I almost cried when the cold woke me up in a dream
-----------
A day of the late summer sun
Mid-stopper dreams about you
When the kids are with me it makes me sick
I'm so cold when I feel hot
Who told you it was good for me
Half smile I'm weak alone
-----------
Hand in hand with another man
Yes it is over
I can not get up in the morning
With a smile like her
I can not, but I know
That your heart took a lesson
-----------
So when you told me, stay and embrace slowly
I replied you could not be mine now
Once again I find myself alone looking out on your window
Waiting for you to watch, we will understand time so well
The wounds that are still open will be slowly closed
And disappear them promise will not be a sign
-----------
Everything will change with a little more unity
Then the heart will soften and love easily
The soul screams and there is one up
Who loves us, everyone's father
Maybe they came home today and not tomorrow
As long as the candle was lit they smiled at the world
-----------
Take care and accept it easily
And most importantly bro keep good health
First freedom only sleep is asking
He is so tired and he insists a bit
Why should we be away from home?
And why was my father hooked news now
-----------
Let us go crazy, another night goes wild
Save your questions, you will not hear lies
I only want to enjoy myself, not to know from trouble
Please leave me, let me live
No one here will tell me how to behave
And do not bother me when I'm celebrating.
-----------
How all the fears now come back to me
What's happening to me? , And what she did to my life
It's the same silence that still roars in the room
Before she left, she said, It'll be all right
But her image reappears at night
In pursuit of her I am tired, I have no strength
-----------
Only sometimes do you suddenly appear in my sleep
It's not fair and it's not real
And I learned to live without you
Years passed and married after
And this wound does not pass
It's funny that I still have pain
-----------
There were days when everything was fine
We also knew a great love
I thought I could handle faith
If you have someone who is better than me
Tell him that you are special
The pain will be revealed and he will learn to be alone
-----------
Sometimes I break
And gathering myself again
The doorbell rang like a king
I thought that this was what I imagined but I was wrong
And life drew me to another city
Find the one that disappeared ..
-----------
When you remember and tell me how I left the one
The one I loved so much
Maybe I was wrong when I believed
Which is a dream that everyone wants to dream
When I woke up, I understood
That it's a nightmare and how good it is that you are not here
-----------
Black hair glides, eyes piercing like fire
Dancing with you feels like a dream
I'm falling in love with you
Seal the look with a kiss
As an excited child I am burning like a fire
He wants to shout hard, in love.
-----------
You do not understand how much I love
And you can not escape
You loved me too much recently
You disappear and without you I have no peace
With you to take away all my feelings
Except for a suffocating reality
-----------
Together we will see the light
Give me a second chance
Forgive you
I was wrong in the way I chose ...
Give me a second chance
Forgive you
-----------
What am I and what is my power without you?
When you're with me I feel so happy
You can not, and without you it's over
Wherever I go
You are always in my soul
He hears your voice shouting at me
-----------
And explains how we two
Love you every minute, every second ..
Passing this morning another day passes
Emotion grows without fear
A whole life passes so fast
The main thing is that we are here together
-----------
Day and night you think your name
The holy prayer on my lips
My hands up
My father, do not leave me in a foreign country
My tears from pain were carpentry
Under your wings take me
-----------
Memories in my heart
Your name in my mouth like a woven song
Softly I will walk
That's how I know your secret
But that's my life
I'll know you're there
-----------
Get up and see
Adam laughs to tears
The continuous sounds
Into your heart they flow
You remember the day before yesterday
She will not come back
-----------
My eyes are gone
I'll go after you
Who knows who hears
How fear in me crawls
Who knows who hears
The blood flows
-----------
Soon he would come for help
Goal will come, my brother, fear not
As if they were a holy shrub
You are holy
The angels are abrasive to you
We messengers you expect
-----------
How to hold my tongue
Who knew grief
How can I be happy with my part?
If you're not around
How can I be happy with my part?
What is the future?
-----------
A man on his silver-silver flag
Glowing yarns have no end
He poured sills there high up
Main and seven columns exist
The throne is the throne of eternal kingship
Iowa is an ancient seat
-----------
Sending you thousands of greetings
The night is cold
Inside my room
Warmth and tenderness in my dream
My little girl
A letter she sent with love
-----------
The nights are cold in my life
My mind is tired of worry
We spent magical nights together
A whole life has passed
Candles are lit on your small table
I look at you and wonder
-----------
Facing oak trees
Waiting in silence
Maybe I'll see you
Leaves dropped
Days will shine
Your figure to pass
-----------
Like the sea sweeping me
Into space
My soul is silent for you and why
I'll go free from here
My soul is silent for you and why
Tomorrow I will return by sea
-----------
I whispered in the silence
On the face of the earth
Heaven created above
Days to infinity
You gave life to all life
Pure souls in heaven
-----------
My life was a time of immature life
We were an innocent couple together
Some naughty little different
A dim smile burns me
He strokes a little ashamed
Going human time flies
-----------
Little people tended to talk that we kept restraint
So lots of thank you music for being busy
I will not stop in my life just for you I live
From before or on my side I need you behind me
I will not stop in my life just for you I live
From before or on my side I need you behind me
-----------
The sun shines in the distance
Everything is green outside
Bad news
The birds are dead
The sun sets soon
I wish we would learn to love.
-----------
South Central North
Wherever you want, we'll flow
Want to flow all day
Boyka from Netanya let me just flow
Yellow green
Represent every day ...
-----------
Cash is never the point
And if you're here I'm ready
Do not want to be an actor
Want to enjoy without wasting your time
Cash is never the point
And if you're here I'm ready
-----------
There's no hype where Mike picks up Mike
Every time a muse comes up with the axite
A mentor should maintain a balance on temperament
Without forgetting that every month there is a fantasy for the government
That's no reason not to screw the signature
A shochet was given in Mayotte before it came back.
