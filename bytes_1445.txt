All My Life
Foo Fighters

All my life I've been searching for something  
Something never comes never leads to nothing  
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close  
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

Oh Susannah
James Taylor

Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee,  
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see.

As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee.

Vacant Planets
Death
----------------
Mysterious object of flight on a voyage  
To correct what they have done, what we are doing  
Perhaps submerged, living in the inner most  
Recesses of the planet - no choice but  
To adapt to an underground world  
Limiting our passages of thought  
Are they the examples of regression  
A life form's abusive progression  
In a realm so vast, we sit among the Vacant Planets

Honky Cat
Elton John

Numb
Green Day
----------------
I'm tired of being what you want me to be  
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface  
Don't know what you're expecting of me  
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
I've become so tired so much more aware  
I've becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
Can't you see that you're smothering me  
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control  
Cause everything that you thought I would be  
Has fallen apart right in front of you  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
And every second I waste is more than I can take  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
I've become so tired so much more aware  
I've becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
And I know  
I may end up failing too  
But I know  
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
I've become so tired so much more aware  
I've becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
Is everything what you want me to be  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
Is everything what you want me to be

Raking Up Leaves
Tom T. Hall
----------------
All summer long you smelled like lotion and we made love when we took the
notion  
Summer is gone and it's hard to believe how lonely I am raking up leaves  
Raking up leaves and counting the days  
Yes and counting the nights that you've been away  
The winter winds blow and memories freeze  
I'm missing you and raking up leaves  
[ sax ]  
Expecting the sun just any day now wish you were here to go out and play now  
You say you'll return when they're on the trees  
I'm hungry for you and raking up leaves  
Raking up leaves and counting the days...

Eurythmics

You don't call me anymore  
But don't you think that I don't care

Just to see if you are there

My clock goes ticking through the night  
Counting the seconds I don't sleep

Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, never be the same  
And remember how we once were  
When you held me so closely  
We were breathing in the dark light  
There was no more pain  
One love, one heart, one soul together, ooh  
Was it just another love affair?

Was it just another love affair?

In the moonlight:  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"  
Everyone will agree

She's so kissable and caress-able "Chincherinchee!"

Another town, another place  
Sometimes I don't feel right  
Nerves wound up too damn tight  
People keep telling me it's bad for my health  
But kicking back don't make it  
Out of control, I play the ultimate role  
But that's what lights my fire

But how can I avoid the stress?  
I need to know, but right now all I can do is guess  
What does he want?  
A fancy cell phone or a tube of grout  
What does he want?  
I don't know, but I'll figure it out  
What does he want?  
Rear-view mirror glasses as seen on tv  
What does he want?  
I only wish I knew what he got me...  
'Cause I hear it's perfect.

Gary Valenciano

I used to feel the emptiness inside me  
I was not supposed to feel that way  
I had everything I needed  
But nothing ever made me  
What I longed to be  
The wealth, the name  
The lights, the fame  
Were everything to me  
And then one night  
Out of the blue  
I heard His name (Jesus)  
And so I took that step of faith  
And walked into His domain  
I believe that's what He wants  
Every heart to do  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you

Baby's got a brand new hairdo, and doesn't she look so fine?

Except she's picking your heart, not mine  
She said "it doesn't matter unless I say it matters"

The girl that used to have it, and girl I still have

Baby's got a brand new hairdo, and doesn't she look so good?  
She looks like Billy Boy Arnold, said I wish you would  
I wish you would  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, I wonder what's left inside  
She used to [?] at med school, before she learned how to be snide  
She walks in the place and everybody scatters  
I don't care about all the modern girls  
She's the girl that I used to have and the girl I still have  
She the, she the...

Welcome To My Revolution
Utopia
----------------
There's too much music, too much light  
These endless broadcasts into the night  
Petty seizures of money and drugs  
By some official or unauthorized thugs  
Now it's gone, the whole world's gone  
There's the army at the front door, guerrillas in back  
Why do I always have to take up sides  
I had no plans to be conscripted today  
I am no use to them anyway  
So what the hell's going on  
When they took my bed for the good of the state  
I had to rest my head and took to levitation  
Welcome to my revolution  
Every morning they confer with the press  
Just to point a few fingers  
Fix the blame for this mess  
The spokesmen waffle and the jerk-offs complain  
In a stream of rhetoric  
Piss themselves down the drain  
Then it's time to go home  
Time to go home  
What will they say when it's gone  
The whole world's gone  
So they call a cease fire to bury the dead  
And just delay it for an hour or so  
Loose talk of cowards and leaders that lied  
What does it matter once we're vaporized  
Say what the hell's going on  
Then it got so bad I couldn't breathe the air  
So I became my own church and begged for sanctuary  
Welcome to my revolution  
This is the dream that I have every night  
I wake up screaming t  
Is this my vision of the end of the world  
The faces looked smoldered, the edges are curled  
Tell me what is the reason we can't look at ourselves  
And realize everybody creates his own hell  
And if we put it together to make them all real  
And then forget how to think, forget how to feel  
Until it's gone, the whole world's gone  
Are we damned if we do and damned if we don't  
Could we be suckered into thinking that  
Or get too greedy, afraid of the loss  
And wind up fighting for a worthless cause  
What if we died and had to come back  
How may times would we have to go 'round  
What if tomorrow was the end of the line  
Don't want to feel like I wasted my time  
So what the hell's going on  
When the noise gets so dense  
you can't hear yourself think  
We got the spirit world on a telephone link  
So welcome to my revolution

Until The Real Thing Comes Along
Natalie Cole

I'd wait for you

Comes along

Eight More Miles To Louisville
Willie Nelson

I've traveled o'er the country wide a seekin' fortune fair  
I've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere

A Little Somethin'
LL Cool J
----------------
Here we go, another funky style  
Peace to my brothers on "Rikers' Isle"  
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile  
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild  
This here part is like section one  
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns  
Early mornin' light is yet to come  
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun  
Females, let your hair down  
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown  
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz  
You give me to the "sploshers", you can get your-a blast  
Enter at your own risk, some brothers got weapons  
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied  
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone  
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop  
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop  
Dosey-do your partner all night long  
And all you mothers, bring your kids along

Desolation Row
Grateful Dead
----------------
They're selling postcards of the hanging  
They're painting the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors  
The circus is in town here comes the blind commissioner  
They've got him in a trance one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker  
The other is in his pants and the riot squad they're restless  
They need somewhere to go as Lady and I look out tonight  
From Desolation Row.  
Cinderella, she seems so easy  
"It takes one to know one," she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets  
Bette Davis style and in comes Romeo, he's moaning  
"You Belong to Me I Believe"  
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend  
You Better leave" and the only sound that's left  
After the ambulances go is Cinderella sweeping up  
On Desolation Row  
Now the moon is almost hidden the stars are beginning to hide  
The fortune telling lady Has even taken all her things inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing he's getting ready for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight  
On Desolation Row  
Now Ophelia, she's neath the window for her I feel so afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spend her time peeking  
Into Desolation Row  
Einstein disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
As he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
Now you would not think to look at him but he was famous long ago  
For playing the electric violin  
On Desolation Row  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser she's in charge of the cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul"  
They all play on the penny whistles you can hear then blow  
If you lean your head out far enough  
From Desolation Row

Haunts Of Ancient Peace
Van Morrison
----------------
Beside the garden walls,  
We walk in haunts of ancient peace.  
At night we rest and go to sleep  
In haunts of ancient peace.  
The love and light we seek,  
The words we do not need to speak,  
Here in this wondrous way we keep  
These haunts of ancient peace.  
Let us go there again  
When we need some relief  
Oh, when I can't find my feet  
When I need rest and sleep.  
The Sunday bells they chime  
Around the countryside and towns  
A song of harmony and rhyme  
In haunts of ancient peace.  
The holy grail we seek  
On down by haunts of ancient peace.  
We see the new Jerusalem  
In haunts of ancient peace.  
Oh, when I can't find my feet  
Oh, when I need some relief  
One more time again.  
You know I want to go there one more time again.  
Be still in haunts of ancient peace.  
(Be still)

You gotta be a do right all's night man  
They say it's a man's world  
But you can't prove that by me  
And as long as we're together  
Show some respect for me  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man

And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud  
If I hadn't been a-ridin that Tennessee stud

Well, I'm sitting on a stone  
Sitting all alone  
Daisies are rolling down the mountain  
Well see the lonesome tramp  
Who's living in the damp  
Nobody's in the valley

Oh it's so cold right here  
Shine on, shine on sun  
Shine on all night long  
All night long

When Spring Comes Round
Harry Belafonte
----------------
When spring comes around my love  
When spring comes around  
When winter is gone the hills are green  
Song of the lark is clear and clean  
I long for the lands I've never seen my love, my love  
When summer comes around my love  
When summer comes around  
As soon as I feel that sudden breeze  
I hoist my sail to the seven seas  
And let the wind take me where it please my love, my love  
When autumn comes around my love  
When autumn comes around  
As soon as the leaves begin to fall  
I'll anchor in some port of call  
I'll write a letter sending you all my love, my love  
When winter comes around my love  
When winter comes around  
The world will be white with silent snow  
The temperature down to ten below  
And home to the warmth of you I go my love, my love  
When spring comes again my love  
When spring comes again  
You and the lams will play again  
And though I will want to stay again  
You know I'll be on my way again my love, my love

For Wanting You
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
It comes as no surprise  
Your face filled with lies  
Hovers all around me in this room  
Clouds hung with my dismay  
A hot bed where we lay  
Your every kiss tasting like a tomb  
If time becomes a judge  
If my body holds a grudge  
It's just because I needed sanctuary  
Your skin under my nails  
My curiosity that failed  
To save myself for something that I need  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you  
We do things 'cause we must  
The law of love and lust  
Comes together just like oil on flame  
I looked into your eyes  
You saw me naked for a while  
How d'you like it in my little nest?  
Who was really using who?  
In here the scent of you  
Stains the sheets with memory and lust  
When I get back on the street  
Tell everybody that I meet  
Maybe these aren't scars, they're only rust  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you

We got three hundred thousand, all they ever got next to us.  
They gather the Southern people at an old Southern steel shop,  
And I wish we'd got three million more, mud we've got.  
I can't take off my musket, fire now no more,  
But I ain't gonna rebel, yes I got damn sure.  
You don't want no part in what I've done or am,  
And I will not be reconstructed and I do not give a damn

Power To Love
Ray Boltz
----------------
Power To Love  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Their leader was gone now  
Their number was few  
Left in the world full of hate  
They gathered together  
And started to pray  
All they could do now was wait  
That's when the power  
Came into the room  
Praise started filling the air  
Suddenly they were no longer afraid  
They felt His love everywhere  
Chorus:  
It's the power to love  
The power to reach out  
To someone in need  
It's the power to love  
The power to conquer  
This world full of greed  
There is no equal on earth  
Below or above  
We have the power to love  
It spread through the city  
And out in the street  
A multitude gathered around  
The power of heaven  
Was filling the earth  
It turned the whole world upside down  
People were singing  
And praising the Lord  
Laughter was filling the air  
Filled with His glorious  
Power and strength  
They took His word everywhere  
Chorus  
We will never lose  
We will conquer through love

Tonight by still waters deep  
Tonight for my soul to keep, still waters lead me to your  
Still waters, I need to drink of your still waters  
Now that I know the kind of love that comes to fill me up  
Fill me anew with love from you and overflow my cup  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way

Take her for a spin with your stereo jack  
Tell her she's the best girl you've ever had  
Give it some gold to put round its neck

All For Leyna
Billy Joel
----------------
She stood on the tracks  
Waving her arms  
Leading me to that third rail SHOCK  
Quick as a wink  
She changed her mind.  
She gave me a night  
That's all it was  
What will it take until I STOP  
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna  
There?s nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna  
We laid on the beach  
Watching the tide  
She didn't tell me there were ROCKS  
Under the waves  
Right off the shore.  
Washed up on the sand  
Barely alive  
Wishing the undertow would STOP  
How can a man take anymore, whoa  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna.  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna.  
There's nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna.  
I'm failing in school  
Losing my friends  
Making my family lose their minds  
I don't want to eat  
I don't want to sleep  
I only want Leyna, one more time.  
Now, I'm in my room  
Watching the tube  
Telling myself, she still may DROP  
Over to say, she's changed her mind  
So, I wait in the dark  
Listening for her  
Instead of hearing my old man saying STOP  
Kidding yourself, wasting your time.  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna  
There's nothing in it for you

Beneath the windows of  
The house of love  
Like Romeo to Juliet above  
The lights out on the freeway

For always and forever now

Cause you know that I've come here for a reason  
Tell me that there's something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
Tell me what you want now  
But don't let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
The dragonfly at midnight  
The jasmine of your room  
The candle light inside our eyes  
The dawn will come too soon  
I come to you as nothing now  
But everything I am  
I'm burning for you constantly  
Just let me be your man  
Cause you know that I've come here for a reason  
Tell me that there's something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
Tell me what you want now  
But don't let me be denied  
And be my valentine

Coldplay

Somewhere up above the stars  
The wreckage of a universe floats past  
Somewhere up above my heart  
A tiny little seed is sown,  
A government is overthrown,  
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last  
And I heard it on the radio  
That one day we'll be living in the stars  
And I heard it on a tv show  
That somewhere up above  
And in my heart  
They'll be tearing us apart,  
Maybe moving us to mars  
Past the satellites and stars,  
Maybe moving us to mars  
We won't see the earth again  
In these seconds just remain unchanged  
8 to 9, 9 to 10  
We are meeting for the first time  
We might never meet again you and me  
We are meeting for the first time  
Can't you see  
76543  
We are meeting for the first time  
Singing this space symphony  
They'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars,  
Past the satellites and stars  
They're moving us to mars

I can't contain it, I can't hold it in

White water running wild  
In a restless rushing fury  
To see souls reconciled.

And while some venture to the shoreline  
Some even dare to leap  
Chorus:  
And The River rages, The River runs  
All through the ages, Long after I'm gone  
There's a truth I'm finding I can't ignore  
Whether I dive in or stand on the shore  
The River keeps rushing on.  
All of those who ride the rapids  
Have a message they must tell  
There's a joy in being lost in something  
That's bigger than yourself  
And though the current takes you places  
Where you learn to lose control  
If you think you're going under  
He'll never let you go, never let you go

Back to reality your son's on crack  
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back  
And they both fuckin smell like shit  
And live in the gutter and sell crack to each other  
When they were kids you'd beat em and leave em home  
And even whip em with the cord on the telephone  
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call  
Watch your step to Hell...it's a long fall!  
[Chorus (2x)]  
[Violent J]  
Ah, it's time to pack up and move to the next town  
But we forgot Mr. Bigot, okay, dig it  
We can't show you an illusion 'cause we're all packed  
But I'll still cut ya neck out, how's that?  
[Chorus (4x)]

There's gotta be a record of you someplace  
You gotta be on somebody's books

Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

Today's The First Day
Bread
----------------
Empty nights - endless days  
Sometimes love turns out that way  
Yes I know - it went too fast  
But you can't keep livin' your life in the past  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
It's up to you to make the best of your life  
Open your eyes it's another day  
She was there - she was gone  
You don't know how you'll get along  
I've been there - and I recall  
Better that than never to have loved at all  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
You've got to go and make the best of your life  
For every night there's another day  
Yes you say you've been in love before  
You've been around and you know the score  
But when the tears fill your eyes  
Then sometimes they can blind you  
So my friend - you must know  
Love will come - and love may go  
But when it does don't despair  
Every space has someone just meant to be there  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
I know you're gonna make the best of your life  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
Lift up your eyes, it's the rest of your life

He Could Show Me
Barbra Streisand

He could show me things I've never dreamed of,  
Things I've never thought of before.  
He could show me what I've missed, baby,  
Somewhere there is something more.  
I've never been there, I might get lost at sea.  
I think he's been there and he could show me.  
Could he tell me why the days were empty?  
Days I wasted waiting for tomorrow.  
Some other time, some other place,  
Some other world, some other face,  
He could show me, he could show me.

Going, Going, Gone
Bryan White
----------------
At first I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist  
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought  
But I must have been wrong  
It could have been the music cause it sounded so sweet  
Something sure was sweeping me off of my feet  
All night long, it sure was strong  
Before I knew what was going on, I was going, going, gone  
I suppose it could have the perfume from a honey-suckle vine  
Something sure was driving me out of my mind  
But I should have known all along  
It was your love and it was so strong  
I was going, going, gone  
It might have been the magic written in the stars  
Some gypsy might have read it somewhere in the cards  
It really doesn't matter cause whatever it was  
It led me straight to your arms  
First I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist  
After all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought (so I thought)  
But I must have been wrong  
Before I knew what was going on  
I was going, going, gone  
Going, going, gone  
Going, going, gone

Amor
Rammstein
----------------
Love is a wild animal  
It breathes you it looks for you  
It nests upon broken hearts

And digs tunnels through your ribs  
It drops softly like snow  
First it gets hot then cold in the end it hurts

Pulsing pulsing,  
No push in the vein.  
I've been washing my hands,  
In the stuff I wash my brains.

Wherever there is greed there is speed

Welcome to the new scalextric's breed  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean  
We're only flying past so we dig our sevice fast  
From the waiters to the women to the wine  
Never mind the match, I've an urgent date to catch  
Get me to the concert hall on time  
Pretending to be pilots in a war  
Pretending to weave between the flak  
No-one knows what the mission's for  
Blinkered horses on the track  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean

Danny's Story
Phineas And Ferb
----------------
When I was a boy down in South Illinois  
I heard a man playing blues what a wonderful noise.  
He had an old guitar but not a dollar to his name.  
Making music so sad but he was happy just the same.  
He gave me a wink and said son let me share the news.  
If you want a happy life you've got to learn to sing the blues.  
I asked my daddy for a guitar I begged and I plead.  
I said I wanted to play the blues and he just nodded his head.  
Daddy said when he was my age boogy-woogy was the thing.  
Just take the blues a round trip and add a little swing.  
Music has the power that without it he'd have sworn that he'd have never had
met my mom and I wouldn't have been born.  
So what's this?  
This is psychedelia  
It's where the guitar solo came from  
No I mean what with all the colors  
I have no idea

I wouldn't be blockin', blockin' your line  
Is that the love service I'm callin'?  
Come on over mend my broken heart  
Was it so silly, was Cupid so stupid  
Or maybe it wasn't to be that way at all?  
Ooh we lady, if I had my baby  
I wouldn't be wastin' your time  
Ooh we lady, if I had my baby  
I wouldn't be blockin', blockin' your line  
Is that the clown service I'm callin'?  
I've made a fool of myself again  
There's a hole in my pocket, a patch on my pants  
My shoes let in water I'm feeling you're here  
I look in the mirror, I sigh all the time  
The face that I see I know it ain't mine  
Was it so silly, was Cupid so stupid  
Or maybe it wasn't to be that way at all?

You can send me thoughts I'd have no objection  
Now we can fly high in the sky  
We'll live forever, we'll never die

I've spent years losin' touch of what's right and what's real  
Caught up in these missions of my own  
And you're tellin' me you think I've done so damn well  
While we're sittin' here a thousand miles from home  
There's a hole in your wisdom, a hole in your sky  
Two holes in your head where the light's supposed to get by

You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance

Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?

I'm through with love  
I'll never fall again.  
Said adieu to love  
Don't ever call again.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.  
I've locked my heart  
I'll keep my feelings there.  
I have stocked my heart  
With icy, frigid air.  
And I mean to care for no one  
Because I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you  
To hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me for you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.

When love cannot continue, there's not much to be said.

Well how bout that?  
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back  
And I walked into the bar yesterday  
Cause I had something to do, something to say  
And Johnny walked in right behind me and I didn't turn around  
Til I heard the sound of his feet falling on the ground  
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown  
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.

I say revolution, and you say jah

Day day oh!  
And I said, what'cha looking at?  
He hit me across the face with a bat  
I grabbed my. 45 and I said let's get out and go  
So he opened the door and said do what you're here for  
I said I'm wandering round the road four to four  
And I said I been walking for about a thousand years.  
And my feet are growing tired  
My eyes a little wired  
Don't know what to do unless I retire  
And he just said let's play some crazy poker  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a

Jah oh!  
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop  
Don't give a shit cause I got the drop  
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine  
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine  
And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came  
Came to the bar to see what's the same  
I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me  
And to my left was a man, he had no chance  
Didn't really think about starting a scene  
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice  
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad  
Beacuse I took his money last night it's kinda funny  
But now I'm just struggling  
I need a honey-bunny.  
I don't know what to say anymore  
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho...  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah

Hills of golden

That turnin' round  
Is to become confusion  
And the gold's no good for spending  
And the poison's hungry waiting

Saints In Hell
Judas Priest

They laughed at their god  
And fought him in vain  
So he turned his back on them  
And left them in pain

With their banners held high  
Each one of them martyrs  
Quite willing to die  
Wake the dead, the saints are in Hell  
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell  
Cover your fists  
Razor your spears  
It's been our possession  
For eight thousand years  
Fetch the scream eagles  
Unleash the wild cats  
Set loose the king cobras  
And blood sucking bats  
Wake the dead, the saints are in hell  
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell  
We are saints  
In hell  
We are saints  
In hell  
We're going down  
Into the fire  
We're going down  
Into the fire  
The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation  
As carnage took toll for the bell  
Abattoir, abattoir, mon  
Dieu quelle horreur  
For a time is was like second hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
The battle is over, the saints are alive  
How can we all thank you, we felt so despised  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell  
Saints in Hell

'I love you girl' that's what you used to say  
And that no one would ever take it away

But then you took the love right from my heart  
It's funny a thing so strong can fall apart  
I gave you all I had inside, baby it's alright, ooh  
One day you'll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that you'll change when you never do?  
I've always found a reason to let it slide, baby not this time.  
Ooh, because I know where you're going from here (Don't take me down with you)

What a big mistake.

Well I'm looking for a woman  
About five foot six  
Who ain't into glamour  
She's just into kicks  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Who's gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby  
Don't run away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love  
Well I'm walking down the street  
And my heart's feeling heavy  
Swaying with the beat  
'Cause I'm more than just ready  
She's looking at me  
I can feel it in my bones  
Step right on up  
And I'll be taking you home  
Don't turn away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lot of love  
A whole lot of love  
Well I'm looking for a woman  
Who's looking for a man  
Who's looking for a time  
Like she ain't ever had  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Who's gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night

Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I ain't got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love

Somewhere along the way, I guess I must have gone astray

The first two make it so that I see red  
The third one makes it so that I can't see  
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery  
I'd give up the other women and the W-I-F-E  
I'd give up the other women and the W-I-F-E

Save This Lady
Red Hot Chili Peppers

I got more love than anything else  
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health  
Struck by the notion that it just might be  
A method to the madness that I cannot see  
Something for the freedom of a roughed-up soul  
For the two Years Young is a little bit old  
Born named sue sing a Tennessee tune  
Got buffalo love living on the moon  
Save this lady for me (x4)  
Call me Alabama I'm a Seminole prize  
Got time square hair and a bedroom eyes  
Keystone cops and the billy bob chops  
Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops  
Vampire blood and a baseball glove  
Justa a little bit of what the girl is made of  
National crash into the big lampoon  
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon  
Save this lady for me (x4)  
Losing ground true sounds of liberty  
The forest of the north might hold the key  
Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band  
Black flag wave on on my truck my man  
Blasting for jones and the great unknowns  
Got cheap cologne seventy-six trombones  
Looking for the lady that won't be afraid  
When heaven needs a hammer gotta get things made  
I got more love than anything else  
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health  
Save this lady for me (x8)

Surely something must be wrong.

Where she sat gazing down upon her mate  
And the song that she was singing  
Seemed to say "I'll be right here"  
"I'd like to go, but your love's made me stay."

You broke my heart

A kind I'd never known tho' you weren't fair  
You're unaware  
The heart you break maybe your own  
You used my heart for a plaything  
You'll be sorry, just wait and see  
One day you'll find you are lonely  
And the first one you'll think of is me  
You'll look around  
And when you've found  
That you are all alone then you'll get wise  
And realize  
The heart you break may be your own  
You used my heart for a plaything  
You'll be sorry, just wait and see  
One day you'll find you are lonely  
And the first one you'll think of is me  
You'll look around  
And when you've found  
That you are all alone then you'll get wise

He had a lot to say.  
He had a lot of nothing to say.  
We'll miss him.  
So long.  
We wish you well.  
You told us how you weren't afraid to die.  
Well then, so long.  
Don't cry.  
Or feel too down.  
Not all martyrs see divinity.  
But at least you tried.  
Standing above the crowd,  
He had a voice that was strong and loud.  
We'll miss him.  
Ranting and pointing his finger  
At everything but his heart.  
We'll miss him.  
No way to recall  
What it was that you had said to me,  
Like I care at all.  
So loud.  
You sure could yell.  
You took a stand on every little thing  
And so loud.  
Standing above the crowd,  
He had a voice so strong and loud and I  
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so  
Eager to identify with  
Someone above the ground,  
Someone who seemed to feel the same,  
Someone prepared to lead the way, with  
Someone who would die for me.  
Will you? Will you now?  
Would you die for me?  
Don't you fuckin' lie.  
Don't you step out of line.  
Don't you fuckin' lie.  
You've claimed all this time that you would die for me.  
Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?  
He had a lot to say.  
He had a lot of nothing to say.  
Come down.  
Get off your fuckin' cross.  
We need the fuckin' space to nail the next fool martyr.  
To ascend you must die.  
You must be crucified  
For our sins and our lies  
Goodbye

Waving before the dawning

Which way that things are going

The last one to know  
Which way that things are going

Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me
Gloria Estefan
----------------
I can't light no more of your darkness  
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white  
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me  
Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
Too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life  
But you misread my meaning when I met you  
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line  
But see me once and see the way I feel  
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm  
But these cuts I have, they need love to help them heal  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
'Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Of two girls lay side by side.

That civilization  
Will grind to a standstill  
And we are the people  
Who will make it all happen  
While yer children is sleepin',  
Yer puppy is crappin'  
You might call us flakes  
Or something else you might coin us  
But we know you're so greedy

How can I love someone I never touched?  
You lived under the water, but I love you so much  
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky  
You don't know what a cloud is  
Why does everything I love have to die?  
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be  
But I couldn't let that be  
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe  
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea  
Cause I can't bear to see  
Something so wild just die in a tank

The Revealing Science Of God
Yes
----------------
Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,  
Chased amid fusions of wonder  
In moments hardly seen forgotten,  
Coloured in pastures of chance  
Dancing leaves cast spells of  
Challenge,  
Amused but real in thought,  
We fled from the sea whole.  
Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days underseaarching  
Earth  
Revelaing corridors of time, provoking memories,  
Disjointed but with purpose,  
Craving penetrations offer links with the self-instructors sharp  
And tender love  
As we took to the air, a picture of distance.  
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused  
Expression,  
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing  
Late into corners,  
And we danced from the ocean.  
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many  
Won't to follow,  
Only tunes of a different age.  
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life  
Everlasting.

When the world goes 'round  
I can still make it right  
I can see so far in my dreams  
I'll follow my dreams until they come true  
There is a star  
Waiting to guide us  
Shining inside us  
When we close our eyes  
Come with me  
You will see what I mean  
There's a world insight  
No one else ever sees  
You will go so far in my dreams  
Somewhere in my dreams  
Your dreams will come true  
Don't let go  
If you stay close to me  
In my dreams tonight  
You will see what I see  
Dreams to dream  
As near as can be  
Inside you and me  
Will always come true  
Inside you and me  
That always come true

The Message In The Middle Of The Bottom
Chaka Khan
----------------
I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view, then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it, I heard it, I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it

Arrogant Worms

I hate the skydome and the cn Tower too

I hope that someday You choose to find them.

You're still the same I wait with longing heart to see You come again  
Your sweet and tender love will never end.

Eternally
Utada Hikaru
----------------
Right before me, you glimmer slightly I can't see anything else  
Where are we ?  
Don't disappear into the background beginning to stir  
With commotion just yet, I can't hear anything anymore.  
But I can feel you breathe  
A little unlike myself I'm expecting something  
From a surprisingly coincidental development.  
I wanna be here eternally  
I want to gaze at you just like this  
I can feel you close to me  
I can't be by your side forever  
Only this moment will last forever.  
I want to be with you on my break before I go to war.  
We'll leave the promise until next we meet.  
Can you hear me breathe?  
Everyone has times when they are moved by not so surprising  
Developments.  
I wanna be here eternally  
In a place no one will find us  
I can see you're all I need  
I don't need help getting to tomorrow  
Even this moment is surely just a fantasy  
I can feel you close to me  
Even if we can't go back to that place,  
At least this feeling will last forever  
I wanna be here eternally  
I can see you are all I need  
Only this moment will last forever.

Then there'll be no dreams for me tonight  
No more grass schemes to try to make you mine  
'Cause no dreams are gonna change the way you feel  
Guess I?ll just go somewhere, and hide away and heal  
Maybe some day you'll have a second thought  
About the love that we just lost  
Gotta hope you do but baby tonight, she?ll see and let you go  
Get used to being on my own  
Oh girl, if you really should, really should  
Then there's no dreams for me tonight  
No more grass schemes to try to make you mine  
'Cause no dreams are gonna change the way you feel  
Guess I?ll just go somewhere, and hide away and heal  
I could tell you the meaning that your heart stopped being in it  
It?s too late for dreams no matter how magic they may be  
'Cause no dreams are gonna change the way you feel  
Guess I?ll just go somewhere, and hide away and heal

Something Fine
Leo Sayer
----------------
Papers lie there helplessly  
In a pile outside the door  
I tried and tried, but I just can't remember  
What they're for  
The world outside is tugging  
Like a beggar at my sleep  
Ah, that's much too old  
A story to believe  
And you know  
That it's taken it's share of me  
Even though  
You take such good care of me  
Now, you say Morocco  
And that makes me smile  
I haven't seen Morocco  
For a long, long while  
The dreams are rolling down  
Across the places in my mind  
And I've just had  
A taste of something fine  
The future hides and the past just slides  
England lies between  
Floating in a silver mist  
So cold and so clean  
And California's shaking  
Like some angry child will  
Who has asked for love  
And isn't answered still  
And you know  
That I'm looking back carefully  
'Cause I know  
That there's still something there for me  
But you said Morocco  
And it made me smile  
And it hasn't been that easy  
For a long, long while  
And looking back into your eyes  
I saw them really shine  
Giving me a taste  
Of something fine, something fine  
Now, if you see Morocco  
I know you'll go in style  
I may not see Morocco  
For a little while  
But while you're there  
I was hoping you might keep it in your mind  
To save me just a taste  
Of something fine

I'm impossible she's exciting  
Bound together with joined up writing  
In the church

In a bar

Moments vanish her love so subtle  
I went home  
It's not surprising  
Words were few  
And realizing  
I was deep in my points of view  
So interested to talk to you talk to you  
She' s romantic and I'm selected  
Glances swapped and thoughts collected  
By her song  
It's not her singing  
Words were few  
The bell was ringing  
On the table my cards are shuffled  
Words take time to get so muddled  
I'm off home  
I'm shy but eager  
Tomorrow comes  
I hope to see her  
On the stage with her velvet voice  
Though some would say that it's just a noise  
I bit off more than I could chew

A fool to herself

To hold me tight and the cowboy bands in mission  
Of Texas waltz

To keep me from climbing the wall

Cheatin' In Your Dreams
Meat Loaf

You see me now as large as life, but underneath you knew all too well  
The hollow shell, no spark of life  
Where once upon a time there beat a heart  
For you and you knew it from the start, and you went and blew it all away  
And you knew how, oh you knew best  
The strings to pull and buttons to press  
To wind me up and make me shake, you controlling every move I made  
I couldn't see through it, all the pain, and you put me through it  
Over and over again, just tell me over and over and over

Sing Out The Song
Wishbone Ash

Remember the bar garden  
Glass filled with beer  
Nothing to lose, only good times to gain  
A friend to help along  
When the words wouldn't come  
CHORUS:  
Sing out the song brother  
Sing it loud and clear  
Then we'll laugh together  
Like the old days (so dear)  
The rusty guitar  
Its sound filled the air  
Out of tune choruses  
That didn't sound quite there  
How about the joker  
He got his laugh and then he said  
CHORUS  
The way the things are now  
It's not the same anymore  
And I sometimes wish that  
We could all sit down together  
And sing it all again

That Summer
Garth Brooks

I went to work for her that summer  
A teenage kid so far from home  
She was a lonely widow woman  
Hell bent to make it on her own  
We were a thousand miles from nowhere  
Wheat fields as far as I could see  
Both needing something from each other  
Not knowing yet what that might be  
'Til she came to me one evening  
Hot cup of coffee and a smile  
In a dress that I was certain

As I walk alone in the city  
Makin' me an offer, now don't they look pretty  
New cinema  
Live action, all the noise of attraction beats up  
On the streets, the sellers do mark up  
Better than tellin' 'em off, don't stock up  
Shark, they don't bite  
All that matters is you're not here tonight  
And now that I wonder  
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under  
Under sea, under you, under we, undivided,  
Undecided

Send My Body
Randy Travis

The judge found me guilty of wrong doing  
And sentaced me to hang in mid-July

"If I was you I'd breake right down a cry"  
Well, Nobody seems to care I ain't guilty  
I never did the things they said I've done  
But I guess they have to hang somebody  
And It's looking like I'm gonna be the one  
So send my body home on a freight trian  
Don't worry none if I don't go 1st class  
Send my body home of a fright train  
So everyone can see me when I pass  
Don't worry none about no fancy funeral  
Cause it don't matter how they lay me down  
Just see they bury me out by Mama's Apple Tree  
And send my body back to my home town  
My Mama was a damm ahrd working woman  
And she tried to raise he kids without a fault  
The last thing sh said, she was on her dying bed was "Son, on't get in trouble
with the law"  
When the time comes to meet my maker  
I'm gonna try my very best  
To take it like a man  
When they ask if I have one request  
I'll just say "send my body home on a freight trian  
Don't worry none if I don't go 1st class  
Send my body home of a fright train  
So everyone can see me when I pass"  
"Don't worry none about no fancy funeral  
Cause it don't matter how they lay me down

Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would ever believe it  
It's just a thought and nothing more

And memorized each night before your sleeping  
And every word is such a joke  
Strung from neon masts flying flags you hope  
Will win you friends and give your life some meaning  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would never need it  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say

Forever Now
Moody Blues

If we could live forever  
Where would our dreams lead us to  
Living in a world of ever  
Changing expectation  
If it could be  
If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If we could be here forever  
Where in this world would heaven be  
As we race across the universe  
In search of confirmation  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be forever now  
There's no way out  
There is no return  
There's no way back  
There's no way to learn  
The final act  
The curtain falls  
On the stage  
On the stage  
Standing at the crossroads  
Waiting for the new millennium  
For if it could be  
If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If we could live forever  
Where would our dreams lead us to  
Living in a children's world  
Of simple fascination  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  
For if it could be, if it could be  
It would be forever now  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now

What a life I lead what a life  
Laugh in my face why don't you

I tripped and then I fell for  
The beauty of Wynona  
At night I toss and I turn  
And I try and dial your number  
It's changed and God only knows  
Where you been since last December  
Where you been with that twisted smile  
Laying another on the pile  
It ain't easy when we go down for  
The beauty of Wynona  
Girls they skip double dutch  
I saw you there prayed my God  
But my prayers don't mean nothin much  
With a heart that cannot be won  
Rain in that wishing well  
Right here in my own bed  
It ain't easy when we go down for

The Scene  
(Graham Russell, Mark Towner Williams, Cliff Rehrig)  
It's another lovely day  
Are we still so far away  
And how can I share it with you  
It's not easy to believe  
Are we both about to leave  
Without ever saying, I do  
I still love you  
(Chorus)  
Just make me part of the scene  
Say we're together, always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say we're part of the scene  
I don't want to hear it, I just couldn't bear it  
If things weren't as good as they seem  
You can say I'm not the one  
That a lot of faith has gone  
The bridges were never quite crossed  
Every grain of truth, we deny or prove  
Is somewhere before it gets lost  
And is found again  
(Repeat Chorus)  
What if these feelings are all in my head  
Flying around me in a world of their own  
What if there's nothing that needs to be said  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Say we're together, always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say we're part of the scene

He lights every star that makes a darkness bright  
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night  
He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer  
Saint or sinner call and always find him there  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive  
(He can grab a wish or make a dream come true)  
He can paint the clouds and turn the gray to blue)  
He alone knows where to find a rainbow's end  
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend  
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold  
He knows every lie that you and I have told  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive

And all the children lost down many paths,

Not Enough
Van Halen
----------------
To love somebody naturally  
To love somebody faithfully  
To love somebody equally  
Is not enough  
Is not enough  
It's not enough  
To love somebody secretly  
And never touch  
To love somebody honestly  
And always trust  
To love somebody tenderly  
The tender touch  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Love hurts you sometimes  
It's not so easy to find, no  
Searchin' everywhere  
You turn and swear  
It's always been there  
To love somebody foolishly  
Can happen once  
To love somebody hopelessly  
It hurts so much  
To love somebody equally  
Is not enough  
Is not enough  
It's not enough  
Love takes a little time  
It's not so easy to find, no  
Searchin' everywhere  
You turn and swear  
She's always been there  
Standin' there...oh  
And if it don't come easily  
One thing you must believe  
You can always have trust in me  
Because my heart will always be  
Yours honestly  
Yeah, love hurts you sometimes  
Not so easy to find, no  
Searchin' everywhere  
Then turn and swear  
It's always been there  
Standing there  
Love hurts you sometimes  
Not yours, it's not mine, no  
Love's only to share  
Turn and swear  
It's everywhere  
Standing there  
Cause it's always been there

Modern Love Story
Youth Of Today
----------------
A boy a girl a love story  
But why did it end in misery  
Taking our chances getting our thrills  
Taking and taking but never getting our fill  
And this is what I see a modern love story  
Love defined on our TV  
Telling us teaching us what we need  
Are we in love or just so alone  
That we're looking for anyone to hold  
And this is what I see a modern love story  
When the prey is caught, the thrill gone  
So we'll switch partners and move along  
And we won't use our brains  
Because our lust is too strong  
Overlooking the person to whom  
The body belongs  
And this is what I see a modern love story

Heard Somebody Cry
Oingo Boingo

(I thought I heard somebody cry--  
I though I heard somebody cry)  
I went to see what I could find  
Like flowers in the dead of night  
Like shadows in the moonlight--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
CHORUS  
It isn't true  
I am not the ghost  
Without a soul . . . Come  
Listen to my heart  
You feel the beat . . . Stop  
Listen to the sound  
Of moving feet . . . Walk  
Through the halls at night  
When I'm asleep  
I don't believe . . .I don't believe  
The shoe is on the other foot--The glove is on the fist  
The first is like a cannonball--But it feels like a kiss  
I got a bed that's real soft--In a room that's always sad  
I thought I heard a window sigh--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
CHORUS  
A choir with a single voice--a picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
I sip the running water--Like rivers from your eyes  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--I thought I'd go and see  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be me

Look Through Any Doorway

Look through any doorway,  
Each life will tell it's story.  
See the joy and heartbreak,  
For all the world to see.  
She's on the city streets,  
On her face is desolation.  
Just a kid from out of town,  
In the land of hope and glory.  
Look through any doorway,  
Each life will tell it's story.  
See the joy and heartbreak,  
For all the world to see.  
Open up your heart.  
Open up the highway,  
The road will stretch before you,  
For there will be a new day,  
Where love will show the way.  
Only shadows of the world we left behind,  
Open up your heart,  
Many shadows of the past, so don't look back.  
Look at the wars,  
A part of greed affects us all  
There's a better way, despite what they do or say,  
People of the world.  
Look through any doorway,  
Tell me what you see.  
Open up your heartache,  
And love will show the way.  
Searching for the way,  
Through all the doubt and sorrow.  
Days turn into years,  
But we'll build a new tomorrow.  
Look through any doorway,  
Each life will bear its treasure.  
Open up your heartache,  
And love will show the way.  
All the shadows of the world we left behind,  
Open up your heart.  
Many shadows of the past, so don't look back,  
Open up your heart.  
Open up your heart.  
Look through any doorway,  
Tell me what you see.  
Look through any doorway.

Engine in a motorcross  
And make ya feel it girl  
Till ya get sick with it  
And all that junk in your trunk  
Don't be stingy with it  
And I'm gonna make it all good like the weekend  
You got enough for yourself and for all my friends  
And it's enough of me to go round like the globe  
Set it up like a tent, watch it unfold  
I see your eyes glistening for the benji's  
But you ain't gotta fake it  
I just want you to shake it  
Break me off a piece of that action like jackson  
I ain't trying to hit it  
And I ain't trying to wax it  
Picture you and me on the beach and you be  
Climbing up this tall coconut tree  
All I want to do is hump with it and make you scream  
And eat you up  
As I floss with your g-string  
[Chorus]  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come  
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come

Z-Ro
----------------
(Z-Ro talking)  
Uh, seem like they got my life on the big screen  
Z-Ro versus the world, feel me round one  
[Z-Ro]  
Is it reality or just a fable  
The most powerful lyricists in the world was on a low budget label  
Even if I don't clear me in I just want to be living well  
Not saying that heaven is promised to me but I don't want to believe in hell  
Feeling on coming also cause problems worry me  
If it ain't the stress somebody's always trying to bury me  
So thinking I'm undercovers and the dope they try to deal me  
Jealousy and envy make my niggas want to kill me  
Everybody want to pick up a gun and bust thinking artillery fin to be  
drilling me nigga  
But I' sick of this pistol play bumping ain't no more killng me nigga  
Cause I'm a soldier, trying to keep his mind at ease  
And if I squeeze then we all bleed  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Feel a nigga worldwide, not just in Texas  
I think I'm bout to lose my mind, aggravated and restless  
I don't want to die  
[Z-Ro]  
Look at how they made me, traditon systems raised me  
The drama that they give me never ceases to amaze me  
They tell me that my mind's gone, coming up is what my mind's on  
I guess there's nothing left to do but get my grind on  
Thinking about my family but knowing they neglect me  
I'm not gonna give up, I'm gonna make my family respect me  
I'm talking to my father now, daddy I'm a grown up  
Depending on you is false-a-fied because you haven't shown up  
Caught up in these streets I'm taking penitentiary chances  
I done forgived and I done forget plus I'm not giving you anymore chances  
Quick to run out of the house for nothing now your son is feeling anger  
Remember the times you couldn't come around because your life has been in
danger  
I'm a leader to follow is not my destiny  
But I guess it was written for me to fall victim to jealousy  
It's killing me to stay alive, but there ain't no use in me crying  
No matter what I guess it's what is right, on southside  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Whoever would of thought that I would be this fam-ous  
Put in work until it hurt but keep pretending it's pain it's  
Affiliated with killers when we fight us to the death  
Picture your partner cocked and aim and headed straight for your chest  
It's hard to focus cause my homies keep on killing eachother  
Everybody stressing cause ain't nobody feeling eachother  
I often conversate with god but who's to say if he's listening  
Even though I died as a sinner but resurrected as a christian  
At 11 years old I was told that most friends turn to foes  
From velicos to calicoes it helps when our battle folds  
If it ain't true, if it ain't crew, it's a mexican deed  
I'ma catch an attitude instntly bitch you plexing with me  
And ain't no begging for mercy because you shot my nigga  
And I swear to god everywhere you go it's gone be hot my nigga  
And maybe god can forgive you but see the streets seeing different  
They want you dead you might not make it to prison, bitch

Why Look For The Key
Howard Jones
----------------
And they made the secret pact  
His knowledge would be tapped  
The link was based on a respect  
On their lives they would reflect  
A perfect state of non-attachment  
Was striven for and claimed as fact  
The younger grew and learnt his lesson well  
All his ideals were intact  
Why look for the key in another  
The answer lay in his own heart  
Won't find yourself in some other  
It always was there right at the start  
But power it corrupted  
That's where attachment starts  
The power had erupted  
The spell will crack  
As each mental bond was broken  
Strength grew in the young man's heart  
What began as love not passion  
Had left a seed in his heart  
Why look for the key in another ...

Each dream of life, I'll share with you  
Sea returns to sea  
And sky to sky  
In a life of dream am I

In a light to last a whole life through

And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you.

You like to think you discovered them first  
But we all know you moved in after it was safe  
That way you know you could never get hurt  
(You like to play god!!)  
(Repeat chorus)  
You're just a critic, we know why you drink so much

Now what have I done,  
Was it something I said - oh dear  
I need you to turn me off,  
When you think I've said enough,  
To the extent of being a bore  
I need you to tell me no  
Slap my wrists and send me home  
Tell me I can't come again  
Now why are you crying -  
Have I gone too far - again

Torn out of reality

To see a distant light, to hear a far-off horn  
To leave me one more time, I can't stand no more  
Say no more, well no more,  
Well no more, darling, please.  
And every time you leave I make the very same vow  
That when you come back I ain't gonna love you no how.  
But when you return you look so fine to me  
I can't stand no more, my darling, it's just got to be  
I said the last time, oh the last time,  
Oh the last time, darling, please.  
Don't you understand me, don't you understand me ?  
Honey, don't you understand my word ?  
Well, you told me that you love me, I believed you, darling,  
But you lied, you know it's true.  
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving  
Then I'll cry.  
Oh darling, oh darling,  
Oh darling, make up your mind  
Oh, I can't stand your loving, honey, it's tearing me apart,  
You done got my soul, but now you're after my heart.  
Well, don't hurt me, darling, now you know how to do it so well

It was the last time  
It was the last time

Treachery
Kirsty Maccoll
----------------
I'm stalking a fan  
He lives in a high rise block  
And here I am  
He shouldn't have turned my rock  
He's brushing his teeth  
He doesn't look bad from this far  
I'm hailing a cab  
And I'm gonna follow his car  
Wherever he goes  
I won't be too far behind  
Just hanging around  
Driving him out of his mind  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
I'm stalking a fan  
He used to write all the time  
How lovely I am  
He really made me feel fine  
But how they forget  
He needed a wake-up call  
And he will regret  
Having been so shallow  
He made me believe  
That I was some kind of myth  
So here I am  
How could he treat me like this?  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Wherever he goes  
I won't be too far behind  
Just hanging around  
Driving him out of his mind  
I'm stalking a fan  
He's gone to the record store  
To buy a cd  
By some other girl not me  
He's taking her home  
Getting her out of her box  
And putting her on  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Getting her out of her box  
Treachery  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery

Now I ain't one for saying long goodbyes  
I hope all is forgiven  
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover  
You know you had it coming, girl

Mr. Businessman
Cliff Richard
----------------
Itemise the things you  
Covet as you squander  
Through your life.  
Bigger cars, bigger  
Houses, term insurance  
For your wife.  
Tuesday evenings with your harlot,  
And on Wednesdays it's  
Your charlatan analyst,  
He's high upon your list.  
You got air conditioned  
Sinuses and dark, disturbing doubts  
About religion.  
And you keep those cards  
And letters going out.  
And while your  
Secretary's tempting you  
Your morals are exepting  
You from guilt and shame,  
Heaven knows  
You're not to blame!  
You better take care of  
Business, Mr. Businessman,  
What's your plan?  
Get down to business,  
Mr. Businessman, if you can  
Before it's too late,  
And they throw your life away.  
Did you see your children  
Growing up today,  
And did you hear the  
Music of their laughter  
As they set about to play?  
And did you smell the  
Fragrance of those roses  
In your garden?  
Did the morning sunlight  
Warm your soul and  
Brighten up your day?  
Do you qualify to be  
Alive or is the limit  
Of your senses  
So as only to survive?  
Spending counterfeit  
Incentive, wasting  
Precious time and health.  
Placing values on the  
Worthless, disregarding  
Priceless wealth.  
Well, you can wheel and  
Deal the best of them  
And steal it from the rest of them.  
You know the score,  
Their ethics are a bore.  
86 proof anesthetic crutches  
Brought you to the top  
Where the smiles are all synthetic  
And the ulcers never stop  
When they take that final inventory  
Yours will be the same  
Sad story everywhere -  
No one will really care. no one more lonely than  
This rich important man.  
Let's have your autograph  
ENDORSE your epitaph!  
You better take care...  
................if you can!

Going down the old mine with a transistor radio  
Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall  
Slipping and sliding, , all along the water fall, with you...

Santa Rosa
Gino Vannelli
----------------
Hack jaws and hellions don't you step on my z's  
I'm gettin' rather ornery 'bout my natural means  
I'll I want is a small piece of the pie  
A place in the sun to comfort my eyes  
North of l.a. just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna break away  
Blue grass and the sycamores and the sweet eucalyptas in the air  
Mad dogs and wolf hounds running everywhere  
You can go with the flow you can bend in the breeze  
Just step to one side and then play the black keys  
North of l.a. just south of santa jose  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna do what is right to make a better life  
Before it's over  
I'm gonna break away  
Angels and lucifer don't you step on my ground  
I've got a good god-fearing woman who might just shoot you down  
I love her and she loves me  
Together we'll raise such a sweet family  
North of l.a. just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna do what I can to get the sea and sand  
Back on my shoulder  
I'm gonna sail away

Guitar Man
Elvis Presley
----------------
Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,  
Left my mama a goodbye note,  
By sundown I'd left Kingston,  
With my guitar under my coat,  
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,  
Got a room at the YMCA,  
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,  
Just lookin' for a place to play,  
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,  
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.  
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,  
I run outta money and luck,  
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,  
On a overloaded poultry truck,  
I thumbed on down to Panama City,  
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,  
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,  
Makin' music on my guitar,  
I got the same old story at them all night piers,  
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man  
We don't need a guitar man, son  
So I slept in the hobo jungles,  
Roamed a thousand miles of track,  
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,  
At a club they call Big Jack's,  
A little four-piece band was jammin',  
So I took my guitar and I sat in,  
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,  
With a swingin' little guitar man.  
Show 'em, son  
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,  
Find yourself down around Mobile,  
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,  
If you got a little time to kill,  
Just follow that crowd of people,  
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,  
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,  
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,  
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,  
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.

I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims  
Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims  
Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems  
Proceeded to walk in  
Just then I saw this  
Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris  
With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew

The roaches so big

Because sunshine I've never known  
Dig down deep where the ground is cold

Trouble and tears are all that I see  
Now you are gone please hear my plea

Have a holiday as gay as holly.  
May the ones you love be near you  
With the laugh of friends to cheer you.  
When the church bells ring,  
Like the angels sing,  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime,  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree  
[Repeat]  
For a very merry Christmas time.

Convictions
Unearth
----------------
Convictions.  
Lost direction.  
Once a fielded dream,  
Controlled by the heat within,  
Cold could not withstand pressure to keep the sky in my hand.  
Now a failing breeze grabs a hold and pulls me down.  
Hands have turned to clay gripping the hope that lives inside.  
I move on praying for a way to save my own will.  
Time falls whisked away with each breath I take.  
Falling into time.  
A waste, an endless torture sealing a fate of nothing.  
Dark times how do I conquer a life now chains.  
Go onward is the only method.  
Forget the pain and face our progression on.  
Survival is vital.  
In pain we succeed.  
How did I lose my convictions?  
Lost direction.  
Try to find a hold.  
Certain steps are led astray.  
Seems no other space.  
Forcing me out there's not enough time.  
Now it's time to bring all I know to help me win.  
Efforts have gone to hell.  
Crushing my will to act as the lead.  
Failed. Fault. Lost.  
Now climb.  
Push away fading terms the burn the skin.  
Saved till' now.  
Haunts me in each step I take.  
Times have changed.  
Overload is bearing down.  
Face each day circled by what I should have done.  
Dive. Crime. Loss.  
Give into time and fall.  
Procrastination.  
Fail to follow through with all I must do.  
Days they fall in shame.  
I slip in deeper.  
Confined by the weight that overbears.  
Stood tall but killed in it's nature.  
Forced steps I do not care what's there.  
They can see it in my eyes.  
I can it in my eyes.  
Time lies.  
I am falling further down.  
I've tried, but landing is hard.  
Fallen chance.  
Another lesson.  
I'll give it all I can.  
Another lesson.  
I gave it all I could.

Walk on guilded splinters

Don't Let It Get You Down
America
----------------
Written by dewey bunnell, (C)1976  
Found on hideaway.  
Somebody told me that the time was right  
To keep on ridin' and to hang on tight  
I heard the cry of a dog in the night  
But nobody told me it would be all right  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took a ride down a hill that night  
The man was crazy but he wouldn't fight  
With bullets in his back and money in a sack  
We robbed a bank and we never looked back  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night, alright  
Don't let it get you down  
'cause nobody made a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
They'll be lucky if we're ever found  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)

And you should always know  
Wherever you may go  
No matter where you are

And make a living at a piano bar, oh

Lightning and thunder  
Flashed across the roads we drove upon  
Oh, but it's clear skies we're under  
When I am together, when I sing the song

Should I try to make a date

Feel my earth turn over, darlin'

When there's no one else around  
Just this cool, clear water runnin'  
In this love that I've found  
Hey, baby  
See how it can be  
Every time you reveal yourself to me  
I'll come runnin'  
I want to feel myself go under, baby  
Where the deepest river bleeds  
I want to feel it pull me under, darlin'  
Until it drops me to my knees  
I want to know that I could find you  
When there's no more eyes to see  
In this cool, clear water runnin'  
You'll come runnin' to me  
Hey, baby  
All my life I have known there's something more  
Love to blind me like the sun  
Deep in dreams, I will wash upon your shore  
Now I know that you're the one  
And when I feel my baby callin'  
It's like a whisper in a sand  
When the softest rain is fallin', darlin'  
I will crumble in your hand  
And when all that's left is wonder  
And no need to understand  
Well, this cool, clear water runnin'  
Will be all that I am  
Hey, baby  
Will be all that I am  
All that I am

Marillion

Stripped the gloss from a beauty queen  
Found our nest, in the Daily Express  
Met the vicar in a holy vest  
Brought up the children Church of E  
Now I vegetate with a colour TV  
Worst ever thing that ever happened to me  
Oh, for D.I.V.O.R.C.E., oh Judy  
Whatever happened to pillow fights  
Whatever happened to jeans so tight, Friday nights  
Whatever happened to lover's lane  
Whatever happened to passion games  
Sunday walks in the pouring rain  
Curling tongs, mogadons  
"I got a headache baby, don't take so long"  
Single beds, middle age dread  
Losing the war in the Waistlands spread  
Who left the cap of the toothpaste tube  
Who forgot to flush the loo  
Leave your sweaty socks outside the door  
Don't walk across my polished floor, oh Judy  
Whatever happened to morning smiles  
Whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles  
Whatever happened to twinkling eyes, hard fast drives  
Complements on unnatural size  
Propping up a bar, family car  
Sweating out a mortgage as a balding clerk  
World war three, suburbanshee  
Just slip her these pills and I'll be free  
No more Judy, Judy, Judy no more

Just A Dream
Youngbloodz

It ain't a thang in this world that's gonna knock me off my feet  
As I unleash total chaos into the streets  
For I observe these dirty words whispering' through your mouth  
So I now I take it you the big dog about the south  
Oh really now, though whose to say that we won't never make it  
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it  
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk, no matter what  
Now who the fuck, just al nut, it's a must for you to get crushed  
So don't rush to get dat' change  
You'd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame  
For everything ain't everything when times are gettin' rough  
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin' bluff  
Now nigga what, yeah  
Oh, a lot of hatin' went on doing this thang here  
Folks just swore we wasn't finna' put it down for the A-town  
You know what I'm saying? I ain't gotta call no names  
Cause you know who you are  
You know what I'm sayin'  
All I got to say to all of y'all is...  
You can't keep nobody from the Attic down  
Know what I'm sayin', and that's on the floor  
Yea, it's me, remember me from back in the day  
The same ol' nigga you thought wouldn't get paid  
Look at me now nigga, shit done changed  
Ain't no mo' gettin' wet in the rain  
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain  
Sho' nuff' you can hear, but you can't feel me man  
And it's a damn shame, we go through what we do  
Playa hatin' while I'm chillin' on the avenue  
Can't hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew  
that's for trill on the blow, straight from me to you  
Better listen up now, cause ain't no tellin' what's next  
The dem' between real and the ones that flex  
All in your face grinnin' when you cash that check  
But when they get down and dirty it's like "fuck dat' bitch"  
Ass nigga, so how you figga' I was wrong  
Got a baby, and a crib to keep clothes on  
Long time ago, way before the grind  
Trouble had become a friend of mine  
You off up in my head, its just a matter of time  
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine  
Like dem' folks open face off in yo' grill  
I ain't tryin' to be greedy, I'm just tryin' to live  
Now that the picture clear, and you know what I mean  
Being broke all again slick it's just a dream

Aku Disini
Iwan Fals
----------------
Mengantuk perempuan setengah baya  
Di bak terbuka mobil sayuran  
Jam tiga pagi itu  
Tangannya terangkat saat sorot lampu  
Mobilku menyilaukan matanya  
Aku ingat ibuku. .. .. ..  
Aku ingat istri dan anak perempuanku  
Separo jalan menuju rumah  
Sa'at lampu menyala merah  
Di depan terminal bis kota  
Yang masih sepi  
Aku melihat seorang pelacur  
Tertidur mungkin letih atau mabuk  
Aku ingat ibuku. .. .. .. .  
Aku ingat istri dan anak perempuanku  
Di bawah temaram sinar merkuri  
Bocah telanjang dada bermain bola  
Oh. .. .. .. .. . Pagi yang gelap  
Kau sudutkan aku  
Suara kaset dalam mobil aku matikan  
Jendela kubuka  
Angin pagi dan nyanyian sekelompok  
Anak muda mengusik ingatanku  
Aku ingat mimpiku  
Aku ingat harapan yang semakin hari  
Semakin panjang tak berujung  
Perempuan setengah baya  
Pelacur yang tertidur  
Bocah-bocah bermain bola  
Anak muda yang bernyanyi  
Sebentar lagi ayam jantan kabarkan pagi  
Hari-harimu menagih janji  
Aku disini. .. .. . Ya. .. Aku disini  
Ingat ibu istri dan anak- anaku

What it is I think about

Don't look too close I don't like gazes  
Now you see me, now you don't  
Understand me then you won't

I'm 17 I don't look my age  
I share a word you know I mean it  
You give a smile you know I've seen it  
Across the rooms our eyes keep meeting  
Music is my special greeting  
Another night, another town  
It's all so quick, it spins me round

To leave me unimpressed  
Just one caress  
From you and I'm blessed  
When you think you've tried every road  
Every avenue  
Take one more look  
At what you found old  
And in it you'll find something new  
I'm shying from the light

And now you offer me eternal darkness

Can make a better man

I will look in triumph at those who hate me  
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people  
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes  
Though hostle nations surrounded me  
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me  
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
They swarmed around me like bees  
They blazed against me like roaring flames  
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord  
The Lord is my strength and my song  
He has become my victory  
Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do

When you knew that I had given all the kindness that I had  
Did you think that it might be time to stop?  
When you knew that I was through  
That I'd done all I could do  
Did you really have to milk the final drop?  
Not content with my mistake  
You behaved just like a snake  
And you left me for a wasp without a sting  
Tell all my friends back home  
That I did it on my own  
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling

Kimberly
Patti Smith
----------------
The wall is high, the black barn  
The babe in my arms, in her swaddling clothes  
And I know soon that the sky will split  
And the planets will shift  
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop  
Little sister, the sky is falling  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
Little sister, the fates are calling on you  
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind  
The sea rushes up my knees like flame  
And I feel like just some misplaced, Joan of Arc  
And the cause is you lookin' up at me  
Oh baby, I remember when you were born  
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly  
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas  
And I lit a match and the void went flash  
And the sky split and the planets hit  
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped  
Stopped, stop, stop  
Little sister, the sky is falling  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
Little sister, the fates are calling on you  
I was goin' crazy, so crazy, I knew  
I could break through with you  
So, with one hand I rocked you  
And with one heart I reached for you  
I knew you're a youth, was for the takin', fire on a mental plane  
So, I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces  
Burst from the barn and flames in a violet, violent sky  
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me  
You're soul was like a network of spittle  
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic  
And I prayed as that lightning attacked  
That something will make it go crack  
Something will make it go crack  
Something will make it go crack  
Something will make it go crack  
The palm trees fall into the sea  
It doesn't matter much to me  
As long as you're safe, Kimberly  
And I can gaze deep into your starry eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Into your starry eyes, oh  
Oh, oh, in your starry eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, oh oh  
Oh, oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby  
In your starry eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby

You had no reason, no special reason  
For saying what you said to her about me  
She must believe you, really believe you  
Or else she wouldn't have had anything to do with you now  
I often wonder, just sit and wonder  
Does everybody make the same mistakes too?  
I may go under when I feel under  
So don't you take advantage of the situation I'm in  
Forever breaking promises, it's little wonder  
To mend a broken heart is heartache, heartache  
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter if the rain comes down  
I'll find a reason, find a reason if it can be found  
'cause something happened, something happened while I wasn't around  
It could be better, could be better with the rain all around  
Here's a reminder, a small reminder  
Of how things were before you came into view  
It was together, being together  
So don't believe anything you said, makes any difference at all  
You had no reason, no special reason  
For saying what you said to her about me  
It was together, being together

Couple of bags down in old town  
You tie your arm and  
Ask me if I wanted to drive  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now  
Last thing I recall  
I was in the air  
I woke up on the street  
Crawling with my strawberry burns  
Ten long years in a straight line  
They fall like water  
Yes, I guess I fucked up again  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now

And you've got the look of love

It took a little time  
But you calmed me down  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
It's not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
But like a child They're longing to be told  
They've got a wall in China  
It's a thousand miles long  
To keep out the foreigners  
They made it strong  
And I've got a wall around me  
That you can't even see  
It took a little time  
To get next to me  
If something goes wrong  
I'm the first to admit it  
The first to admit it  
But the last one to know  
If something goes right  
Well,it's likely to lose me  
It's apt to confuse me  
Because it's such an unusual sight  
Oh I can't get used to something so right  
Something so right  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
It's not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words "I love you"  
But like a child I'm longing to be told

And I've got a wall around me

I don't want no aggravation  
When my train has left the station  
If you're there or not  
I may not even know  
Have a round and remember  
Things we did that weren't so tender  
Let the train blow the whistle when I go  
On my guitar sell tickets  
So someone can finally pick it  
And tell the girls down at the Ritz  
I said hello  
Tell the gossipers and liars  
I will see them in the fire  
Let the train blow the whistle when I go  
Let her blow, let her blow  
Long and loud and hard and happy  
Let her blow No regrets, all my debts will be paid  
When I get laid Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow  
You'll be left without excuses  
For the evils and abuses  
Down to today from years and years ago  
And have yourself another toke  
From my basket full of smoke  
And let the train blow the whistle when I go  
Let her blow, let her blow  
Long and loud and hard and happy  
Let her blow No regrets, all my debts will be paid  
When I get laid Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

Take my hand and pull me up cause I'm falling too fast  
Somehow I've lost my way - I'm cryin' save me

And every corner of the street  
When mystery is all there is  
You got nothing to lose  
So come on and buy me  
Come and buy me some red red red shoes

Down By The Side Of The Road
John Prine
----------------
Her father was a failure, her mother was a comfort to a doctor  
And lawyer and Indian chief, the shirt ran out of buttons  
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game and they went on relief  
The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside  
Of the chest and she moved away to Oklahoma  
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast, God damn  
My socks are still hard from lying on the sofa on the night  
She was over in my backyard, yeah, we was shooting the breeze out  
Amongst the trees when a shot rang low and left her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Father have mercy, get her a nurse please, she's almost alone  
I saw her hand reaching out for the telephone, we rather see her  
Locked up inside a home than see her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Headlights flashing on her skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck  
It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said  
"Do you want to take a ride?" Out in the pale moonlight light  
Light light lie lie lie lie  
Too long in the hot sun, she could've be miss Wisconsin  
A long time ago, spent to much time inside of the early show  
We'd bought her a ticket but she didn't want to go she was standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Headlights flashing, caught a skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck  
It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said  
"Do you want to take a ride?" Out in through the pale moonlight  
Her father was a failure, her mother was a comfort to a doctor  
And lawyer and Indian chief, the shirt ran out of buttons  
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game and they went on relief  
The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside

Come My Way [version 2]
Marianne Faithfull
----------------
The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
But I've grown weary waiting for love to say,  
"Come my way, come my way."  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy bounce since time begun  
But O how weary and how long the day  
Will he say, "Come my way."  
Lovers all around, I wish you joy,  
Happiness to every girl and boy.  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
"Love come her way," come my way.

But she's hard in the heart like a diamond  
Flashin' fire--cold as ice

Eversleeping
Xandria
----------------
Once I traveled seven seas to find my love  
And once I sang seven hundred songs  
Well, maybe I still have to walk seven thousand miles  
Until I find the one that I belong  
I will rest my head side by side  
To the one that stays in the night  
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow  
And whatever comes will come soon  
Dying, I will pray to the moon  
That there once will be a better tomorrow  
Once I crossed seven rivers to find my love  
And once for seven years I forgot my name  
Well, if I have to, I will die seven deaths just to lie  
In the arms of my eversleeping aim  
I will rest my head side by side  
To the one that stays in the night  
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow  
And whatever comes will come soon  
Dying I will pray to the moon  
That there once will be a better tomorrow  
I will rest my head side by side  
To the one that stays in the night  
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow  
And whatever comes will come soon  
Dying I will pray to the moon  
That there once will be a better tomorrow  
I dreamt last night that he came to me  
He said, "My love, why do you cry?  
For now it won't be long any more  
Until in my cold grave we will lie  
Until in my cold grave we will lie"

Linda Goes To Mars
John Prine
----------------
I just found out yesterday that linda goes to mars  
Every time I sit and look at pictures of used cars  
She'll turn on her radio and sit down in her chair  
And look at me across the room, as if I wasn't there  
Chorus:  
Oh my stars! my linda's gone to mars  
Well I wish she wouldn't leave me here alone  
Oh my stars! my linda's gone to mars  
Well, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.  
Something, somewhere, somehow took my linda by the hand  
And secretly decoded our sacred wedding band  
For when the moon shines down up on our happy, humble home  
Her inner space gets tortured by some outer space unknown.  
Repeat chorus:  
Now I ain't seen no saucers 'cept the ones upon the shelf  
And if I ever seen one I'd keep it to myself  
For if there's life out there somewhere beyond this life on earth  
Then linda must have gone out there and got her money's worth.  
Repeat chorus:  
Yeah, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.

Oh ya............ Andaikata dana perang buat diriku  
Tantu kau mau singgah bukan cuma tersenyum  
Kalau hanya senyum yang engkau berikan

Mendarat mulus didalam sanubariku.............................

Roses of red fall in my heart  
They bloom when he passes me by  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
Oh oh oh ...  
Smiled and turned away

Can come true... Today... Yeah...  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That life could be all that you want it to be... Today... Yeah...  
Chorus:  
If I had wings I would fly  
'Cause all that I need, You are  
And if the world caved in around me  
To You I'd still hold on

And the one that created me  
Jesus... Because of You... I'm free  
Verse 2:  
Would you believe me if I said...  
That God can make miracles happen today

And give all that you can for God... For God[Chorus x2]

Run Honey Run
John Martyn

Well I wish I could think of some cliche to mouth  
To make our parting seem less sad  
But if I told you lies or promised you the moon  
The truth would come trickling from my eyes  
So run honey run, and hide in the wind  
And never stop to look inside your mind  
Well I wish I could wash all my weeping blues away  
And watch them disappear on morning tide  
Oh, but I seek after sword, after sounds of the sea  
A charm forever round my mind  
And I wish I could fly like a bat from a cave  
Through the darkness of my ignorance to light  
I'd forever live on the echoes of our love  
And die like some star burning bright

Everyone I've ever known has wished me well

But when you know that you've got a real friend somewhere  
Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear

Loneliness is my hiding place  
Breastfeeding myself  
What more can I say  
I have swallowed the bitter pill  
I can taste it, I can taste it  
Life is real, life is real, life is real  
Music will be my mistres

Life is cruel  
Life is a bitch

From a much outdated style.

Songs that they glorify I used to play on my guitar yes I did  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
I've known his goodness and mercy for all my days  
I've seen his blessings around me in every way  
In times of trouble when I had no hope in view  
Who brought the sunlight the one light that I knew  
Oh yes I knew he was always there answering every prayer  
Fame will not change him much he won't be out of touch  
Great as he is today big people stay the way they are yes they do

I've known his goodness...

The last verse was the hardest the hardest to get through  
This verse for old lost lovers this song I wrote for you  
She's at the point of no return there's no more candles left to burn  
She's broken every chain that bound her to your soul  
She doesn't care what's right or wrong you've been her victim for too long  
She knows you're too weak to be strong you'll lose control  
Nothing seems to bother her she's as cool as cool has ever been  
She knows she can handle you you've been her fool since God knows when  
[ sax ]  
There's no more chances left to take you're just another heart she'll break  
You're not the first one or the last to come along  
She knows exactly how you feel you think you got a dirty deal  
You left your heart where she could steal it for a song

Zazou, whatcha gonna do?  
There's a lot of people and they're coming for you  
Zazou, comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night

The long hair  
Takes his time  
Sneers at men  
Some ugly people want revenge  
Zazou comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
In the night  
That Zazou he sleeps all day  
Then down to Select or Le Collisee  
Sips his drinks, orders more  
Says what he thinks and it's a crazy war  
Zazou, whatcha gonna do?  
A knock on the door in the night  
Zazou comment allez-vous?  
A knock on the door in the night  
And when the soldiers strut  
All he cares about is love  
When the flags are out

Well there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and  
Collaboration

Now everybody's under somebody's spell  
Unless they've already gone to Hell  
In the streets you can hear the people say  
"That Zazou, he should be locked away!"  
And when the soldiers strut  
All he cares about is love  
When the flags are out  
All he cares about is love  
Well there's a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and

Eagles

Well, I heard some people talking just the other day  
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf  
Well, let me tell you I've got some news for you  
And you'll soon find out it's true  
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself  
Coz I'm al-ready gone, and I'm fee-ling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo  
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why  
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right  
Just remember this my girl when you look up in the sky  
You can see the stars and still not see the light, that's right  
And I'm-al-ready gone, and I'm fee-eeling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo  
Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down  
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free  
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains  
That we never even know we have the key  
Me, I'm already gone, and I'm feeling strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song, coz I'm already gone  
Coz I'm al-ready gone, and I'm fee-eling strong  
I will si-ing this vict'ry song, coz I'm al-ready gone  
Yes, I'm already gone, already gone (awright, nighty night)

And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done

And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
The party?s over, we had our fun  
Flirting with madness a loaded gun  
As much as nothing everything?s changed  
I?m soaking in it, it falls like rain  
You seek the sun to dry off what?s been done  
You?ll heat up every corner of the world  
As you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
Can you keep this pace forever  
I have never seen it done  
Up deep burn all you leave behind you  
You are the surface of my sun  
I measure to what degree  
I can shape up what?s been forged in me  
The cooper penny hissing in the pool  
So much for wishes so much for cooling  
Down this fire impossible desire  
The further you get the more I?m drawn  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand

23a, Swan Hill
Ian Hunter

Wrote this poem called, 'The Floods Roll On'  
He said, this ain't yours  
Where?d you get it from?  
You must have stole it from a book, oh yeah  
You must have stole it from a book.  
?Cause you ain't frail  
You ain't beautiful  
And I don't fancy you at all  
you'd be a ruin  
If looks could kill  
23A, Swan Hill  
Stiff with rage, screaming at the sky  
Innocence breaks  
Says she wants to die  
I'm assuming I'm alive, oh yeah  
I'm assuming I'm alive  
She pushes and she pulls  
My legs go weak  
In fascinating terror  
The whole world moves  
And I'm standing still  
In 23A Swan Hill  
And it?s always raining  
And you never ask why  
You never give yourself a shot  
You just sit and watch your life go by  
Kicking stones at a still life  
Want to pull it down, slash it, slash it  
There must be some way out here  
There must be some way out here  
This ain't right, there must be more to life  
Than breaking and entering  
Doing people?s heads in alcohol, nicotine  
Thinking what I might have been  
You would be a ruin  
If looks could kill  
23A, Swan Hill  
And the whole world moves  
And I'm standing still  
In 23A, Swan Hill  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will

In 23A, Swan Hill

To Find My Strength
Natalie Grant

Sometimes my heart gets weak  
Sometimes my soul feels the edge of the night  
Sometimes my will, my foolish pride  
Carries me far, far away from your side!  
And when I lose my way, I know  
I look to You to find my strength  
Carry me to the end of my days!  
A steady hand to lead me through  
Arms of faith to bring me back to you!  
I will keep my eyes on love  
Set my heart on things above!  
When my soul is so afraid  
I look to you to find my strength!  
Sometimes my hope, it slips away  
Sometimes my dreams come crashing down!  
Sometimes my life, this crazy life  
Has a heart, has a heart of its own!  
And when I lose my way  
You know  
I look to you to find my strength  
Carry me to the end of my days!  
A steady hand to lead me through  
Arms of faith to bring me back to you!  
I will keep my eyes on love  
Set my heart on things above!  
When my soul is so afraid  
I look to You to find my strength!  
When the tears keep pouring down  
And my lips can't make a sound  
I know you hear my prayer  
And your strength is always there!  
I look to you to find my strength  
Carry me to the end of my days!  
A steady hand to lead me through  
Arms of faith to bring me back to you!  
I will keep my eyes on love  
Set my heart on things above!  
When my soul is so afraid  
I look to you to find my strength!

Oh babe, I long to hold you at night  
We two together are so right  
You make the darkness so bright  
My love, we've had one hell of a time  
And we've got over our crying  
And we've come out of this fine  
Because when two loves grow old  
There can be no denying  
That their love may soon grow colder  
Yet that's when we started trying  
Oh babe, this love we have must be for real  
We've overcome, now it's sealed

In the streets and the buildings  
People in their lives  
And the jobs they do for livings

In the cities of the worlds  
Who could vanish in a moment

In a country of the world  
And I wanna go on living  
I wanna see my life unfold  
You know it's hard to go on looking  
At the stories of our days  
And the dangers we are facing  
Growing worse in every way  
And you would think with all of the genius  
And the brilliance of these times  
We might find a higher purpose  
And a better use of mind  
Say it isn't true

Still The Same
Ian Hunter
----------------
They say that some people never grow up  
Lost in time, shackled to the past for ever, stung by love  
Still weaving, still believing yesterday's dreams  
If life is real then so is my imagination  
All I feel is who I am? Who I am? Who I am?  
And if I wished so hard I bled, would you come true?  
All I need's a bottle and the memories come flooding back  
And I see you though the rain, through the rain, through the rain  
They say you can never go back  
What if my love's still the same?  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same  
When love goes right, it's the ultimate high you can be on  
Oh, baby, I've lost count of the times when things went wrong  
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on, on, and on, and on, and on  
And on, and on it goes  
I can't pretend imaginary friends are better  
All I know is people change, people change, people change  
They say I'm supposed to forget and go on  
What if my love's still the same? Still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
(Oh, baby, now)  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same

If I had you in my sights  
Would you ask me to remember?  
Who imagined, I was right  
If you witnessed my surrender  
Do I know, what I would do?  
If you held me like my brother  
Would I see myself in you?  
Well, I dreamed my end was near  
I was almost gone  
If I dream that dream from here  
Can I still come home?  
If you called me, would I hear you

When dormant eyes burst open  
So we can see the way  
Destiny has spoken  
And there's hell to pay  
The sceptics light the candles  
For the eternal right  
Blinded faith's are broken  
Ghosts of father's die  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day  
The message burns the answer  
On the bones of the dead  
Without the necromancers  
Hope hangs from a thread  
The chaos devastation  
Licks immortal sin  
Mother earth is now ridden  
Of those who pray to win  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day  
In distant darkened orders  
The prophets read the signs  
The overlords move over  
To let the blood move over  
To let the blood life shine  
Erasing false deceptions  
An antidote for lies  
Religious rigormortis  
When man as beast arise  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day

Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you  
I've got a secret, I can't hold it back anymore  
I've got to share it with everyone I know  
It's a lifetime waiting for someone like you  
I'm falling, a feeling too good to be true, so true  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus:  
This is the right time, oh oh this is the moment  
I'm gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you x2  
I never thought that, there was a space inside me  
But you found it, a place where you wanted to be  
I'm happy, you gave me time to see  
I'm falling, for the first time I feel that I'm free  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus  
I'll write you a poem in the magazine  
I'll buy some time in the 7 o'clock news  
I run through the city naked shout and scream  
Heeyoo heyoooooo  
I'll drop some flyers from an aeroplane  
I'm making a movie where I'm singing in the rain  
I send out the message to the outer space  
Calling earth, ground control, do you read me?  
I read you, over  
We've got a small problem up here  
We found a guy who says he's got a message for the world  
I think he's really fallen in love...over and out

It's time to buckle up again in my rolling hunk of tin  
It's quittin' time the evenin' race is on  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Oh, Bubba's runnin' right on my bumper  
Pushin' me but there's no where to go  
Lane changin' left and right, blowin' horns and blinkin' lights  
Oh, the fast lane has never been so slow  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Well, the caution is out we're at a stand still  
Heard there's construction up ahead  
Won't be long so they say, soon we'll all be on our way  
Some trucker on the CB just said  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500 every day  
Every day, every day, every day  
Five o'clock 500

Headless Boogie  
[Violent J]  
It's Friday night, dark, scary  
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery  
And its foggy, cold and smoggy  
Hear a dog, a howling doggy  
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun  
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one  
So I watch my back, and what's that  
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback  
Better run, hide, quick, fast  
He's coming for my ass with a shovel  
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit  
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit  
Took a fall, deeper than six foot  
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door  
Into a whole new world of stiffs  
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks  
Club lights, sounds, bass  
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face  
And what I saw next then really took me  
Uh, they did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Hey yo, I heard that you died  
Fuck that, it's time to get live  
Dead bodies let's all take a ride  
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)  
"Oh yeah, we dug up the finest  
Bitches in the graveyard  
So come on down  
And if you ain't come to get your funk out  
Then get the fuck out, bitch"  
[Violent J]  
They all stand straight and swing to the side  
No heads, but they feet still glide  
Take a step back, twist and dive  
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)  
No heads, but they all funky  
And drunk, drinking old Spunky  
Don't be shy, everyone's able  
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table  
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off  
If you're dead, your legs might fall off  
The whole time I can't believe  
I can't conceive, I don't want to leave  
I'm kicking into a freak with no head  
No face, but the rest is straight  
She's with it, I hit it like a G  
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me  
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein  
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine  
Dead stiffs coming through the door  
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor  
I'm getting drunk, I want to be down, what's up  
I want to be the headless clown  
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw  
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"Hey yo, fuck that voodoo moshing, bitch  
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos  
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off  
So you get grave dancing!!!"  
[Chorus (4x)]

Man Gave Names To All The Animals
Jason Mraz
----------------
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, long time ago  
He saw an animal that liked to growl  
Big furry paws and he liked to howl  
Great big furry back and furry hair  
Ah, think I'll call it a bear  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, long time ago  
He saw an animal up on a hill  
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled  
He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how  
Ah, think I'll call it a cow  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, long time ago  
He saw an animal that liked to snort  
Horns on his head and they weren't too short  
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull  
Ah, think I'll call it a bull  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, long time ago  
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail  
Real dirty face and a curly tail  
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big  
Ah, think I'll call it a pig  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, long time ago  
Next animal that he did meet  
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet  
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep  
Ah, think I'll call it a sheep  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Man gave names to all the animals  
In the beginning, long time ago  
He saw an animal as smooth as glass  
Slithering his way through the grass  
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake

Incarceration Of A Flower Child
Marianne Faithfull

Do you remember me ? how we used to be helpless and happy and blind ?  
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine ?  
Laying on the living-room floor on those indian tapestry cushions you made  
Thinking of calling our first born jasmine or jade.  
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,  
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think
about what it might be,  
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor,  
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's.  
You wouldn't listen, you thought you knew better, you just to had to speak to
that man.  
Please believe me, I'll visit whenever I can.  
Laying in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a
day,  
You plead with the doctor who's running the show,  
"please don't take jasmine away and leave me alone."

Kirsty Maccoll

(kirsty maccoll)  
I thought of you when they closed down the school  
And the hospital too  
Did they think that you were better?  
They were wrong  
You had so many friends  
They all left you in the end  
'cause they couldn't stand the patter  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by a struggle  
Going down  
You've got to walk into the water  
With your sister and your daughter  
In this free world  
If I wore your shades could I share your point of view?  
Could I make you feel better?  
Paint a picture, write a letter?  
Well I know what you're saying  
But I see the things you do  
And it's much too dangerous  
To get closer to you  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by the struggle  
Going down  
With a pocketful of plastic  
Like a dollar on elastic  
In this free world  
(I wouldn't tell you if I didn't care)  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by the struggle  
And the ghettoes are full of mercedes benz  
And you'd never hurt a friend  
Who wouldn't tell you  
It's cold and it's going to get colder  
You may not get much older  
You're much too scared of living  
And to die is a reliable exit  
So you push it and you test it  
With 'thunderbird' and 'rivin'  
And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united in the struggle  
In this free world baby  
Got to take it got to grab it  
Got to get it up and shag it  
In this free world  
Going down  
You've got to get into the water  
Like a lamb goes to the slaughter  
In this free world baby  
Going down  
With a pocketful of plastic  
Like a dollar on elastic  
In this free world

I'll lay 'em down as fast as you can pick 'em up  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
Just meters from a canine jubilee  
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me  
He reached a highway through the ticket on the side  
And a trucker came along and let him ride  
But as he settled down to thank him for no harm

Forsake the brine  
Alone with the void for a thousand years

Doom shins it's bitter brink  
Its goblins casting stench to pave the way  
I'm going off to seek the soul  
Who'll teach me of the day  
A boy will be born in the garden  
I'll wait on a patch of green grass  
Somehow he'll know to find me there  
And place a star upon my crust  
We'll trace the crescent's rim  
Pawn's pursuit of deliverance  
My soul a satchel for musical vim  
Then I'll return to save my race

Dance like you, delay

One foot in front of the other  
Keep it simple, one, to repeat  
Never to part the sky  
One, to repeat

Floating under the net  
Fall down to my knees, kiss off, kiss off  
In the rain, stain, to embrace the mouth of every day  
Every car that never came  
You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me

In matted soul and disconnected  
Why didn't you call  
Why didn't I call, to laugh with you  
Bouncing, bouncing  
Is it play town? is it play town?  
Roll the ball with the blue slush cup  
Date line, be my cell phone connection

Electric eye on you  
Who loves to be touched  
Who could dance like you, pleasure all day  
Keep it simple  
One foot goes down in front of the other  
One foot in front of the other  
One, to ever part this sky

You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me

Somebody always tryin' to complain

I kept my cool

I had a lot of drinks and fun  
It just made me sleepy  
There's not much that I want to say  
I never said I am sorry  
It's a bad, bad, bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
On weekends if it decides to rain  
I watch my friends go down the drain

I walked alone into the woods  
I don't take no sympathy

the pounding of her heart.  
When he held her in his arms, tenderness they learned.

He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair the couldn't control.  
While the world was falling down around them, they were not concerned.

Winter brought the snow and a rider down from Franklin with news of how the  
war had taken toll and he would not return.

how he touched her many years ago and how he made her yearn.

That's The Day
Amy Grant
----------------
There are burdens that I carry everyday  
Sometimes they make me want to cry  
Hopeless feelings harbored deep inside my heart  
And I find it hard to hold my head up high  
In the middle of the darkness in my life  
I find a strength to carry on  
I am holding to a promise Jesus made  
And I know it won't be long 'til we'll be gone  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
If you feel there is no meaning in your life  
And it seems you've lost your way  
Listen closely to the voice that's deep inside  
And remember what the Savior has to say  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
And that's the day that I am looking for

Just believe and pray  
We're feasting on your eyes  
Bad temper rules our minds,  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt, this ain't no suicide  
We're on the manhunt,  
What is the victim's face, not us who's wrong  
The terror of the chase, can't be undone  
We turned the game around, not us who's wrong  
You made us go to ground, can't be undone  
We're on the manhunt,  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt, this ain't no suicide  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing

Livin' in the fast lane is easy  
Till you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers

See it through  
So never let your words be lies  
Or they'll come looking for you

No need to worry ourselves, now

No one  
Can deny us the night

Hear the sea  
Come tumbling in  
Freezing us all  
Feeling the breeze  
Beating the pier  
As we try and sleep  
It feels so secure  
Along with the sea I mean  
What a pity  
Our weekend's gone  
The sea remains  
But that's all  
We had a good time  
While we were here  
Goodnight

It's only one man's outlook  
It could be one more lie  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterdays's brushwork  
Using yesterdays' paint  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
They're just vanities to you  
Hear that liverpool wind as I'm making my way  
For the very last time  
Is this a resurrection?  
And do you really care?  
I can't relish no kiss 'til I happen to hear  
Your honeycomb nouns  
Let you down so often  
I'll do the same again  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterday's stories  
It's the same all over the world  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
They're just vanities to you  
Busy little bodies have a story to tell  
Even if it goes against the grain  
Tiny little seeds have got an ocean to swell  
But who am I to rock the boat  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterday's brushwork  
Using yesterday's pain  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly

Naked City
Kiss

All the victims have turned to stone,  
No one is happy, they're all alone  
I'd sacrifice my social position tonight  
In New York, millionaires, and lonely people with lonely stares

In the naked city (in the city)  
There are ten million stories (naked city)  
I'm not lookin' for pity (in the city)  
In this naked city (naked city)  
Street vampires in the night, young lovers and love at first sight  
This is my flesh and my fantasy  
Older women with younger men, I've got a feelin' I'm in trouble again  
But I've got to live my destiny  
In the naked city (in the city) it's a race with the devil (naked city)  
All the pain and the sorrow (in the city)  
Is there more tomorrow (naked city)  
In the naked, naked city (in the city) naked city  
Lonely people lookin' for someone, lonely people goin' their way  
Lonely people lookin' for something, lonely people goin' their way  
In New York, millionaires, lonely people with lonely stares

Is there more tomorrow (naked city)

My baby never was the cheatin' kind

Two hands around the throat,  
Ooh you want to get it right sometimes

Mona Lisa
Natalie Cole
----------------
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you  
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile  
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you  
Or that Mona Lisa strangeness in your style  
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa  
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart  
Many dreams have been brought to your door step  
They just lie there and they die there  
Are you warm? Are you real Mona Lisa?  
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art

Thanks
Bing Crosby
----------------
We used to dwell in love's own palace  
A palace of dreams come true  
Now that we're through I bear no malice  
Though we've called it a day  
All I can say is  
Thanks for all the lovely delights  
I found in your embrace.  
I'm thankful though I know  
It's ending all too soon  
And thanks for unforgettable nights  
I never can replace  
And memories that linger like a haunting tune  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes it's better, for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our road, but still I must convey our thanks

Living In A World Without Her
Pogues
----------------
My girl could break my heart  
And tear my soul apart  
Couldn't see myself living in a world  
Without her  
She's a tear, she's a scream  
Takes me high but my worst dream  
Could I survive living in a world  
Without her?  
My mommy said open the door  
I didn't want to be that boy  
All my friends told me I'd pull through  
But all that's said and all that's done  
Won't persuade me that I'm wrong  
I know I'd die living in a world  
Without her  
All my hopes and all my dreams  
Rest with her or so it seems  
I never want to see the world  
Without her  
She's a saint, she's a clown  
Picks me up when I'm down  
There'd be so much missing from the world  
Without her  
Tangled up in falling vines  
She took my hand, I know she's mine  
Pickin' up the pieces of the past  
Well, I awoke before the dawn  
Dreamed we'd fought and she had gone  
Now I know how it feels  
Without her  
An empty club, when we first met  
Sharing our last cigarette  
How could I have lived in a world  
Without her  
The sweetest girl I ever had  
She's the best, she must be mad  
There's no way I living in a world  
Without her  
We walked four miles to get back home  
Through the crowds we walked alone  
She told me all about her last stand  
The sun came up and lit the scene  
She looked so fine, so I see  
There's no way I'm living in a world  
Without her  
There ain't no way I am living in a world  
Without her  
There's just no way I am living in a world  
Without her

Life Is Worth Living

Ended up on a crossroad  
Try to figure out which way to go  
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
With a long journey ahead  
Said it ain't over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Lost my something and I can't get it back

Past the sadness of the salt flats  
To the prospect of the land fat  
Or just a lazy orange house cat

Before my well runs dry  
I'm going round round round the bend  
Fill it up again
