What I did not give, what I did not try
That will illuminate my days, my days and my nights
Days we've been through, years we've been dreaming
Everything we built, we built for both of us
Call you, call you
To me
-----------
All my days are for you
I will give everything for you
Do not tell me to go
Come and see
Girl, all my days are for you
I will give everything for you
-----------
Keep your ways / I will be from the light of your eyes
Just keep me in your heart
My girl told me Dad / Come to me / Shen in my bed
And with a broad smile I said how much / I love you, my child
Remove any sadness from your face / And I will not give bitter in your life
I swear / You will always be well
-----------
Then he wiped away the tears
And went to pick her Ward
It turned out that the garden
Belongs to her father
He is not lucky
But his time will come
-----------
It's true, she's a helper, a cook for you
And dust she shakes off your desk
What will be the end with her, eh?
The mind is crazy, eh ..
How long will I understand her, eh?
And I want to strangle her, eh ..
-----------
She does not fall asleep
What in her heart no one tells
She does not fall asleep
The thoughts take her in love
She does not fall asleep
Not only did you know at night what she was going through
-----------
In the dark he whispers your name
And before your eyes your figure
I remember your look
How it is to live near you
And kiss only your hand
And feel the warmth of your body
-----------
Mr. Your father is chasing the days
You are left alone to believe
That the time was approaching
Where he promised to return back,
That the time was approaching
In which he promised to return and did not return
-----------
I never came to ask my mouth
What I want and what my heart desires
I came to the world and everything exists already
And like everyone else, I'm just a human being
Tired and disappointed
And only dreams of being a human being
-----------
Another day passes
Dreams we dreamed
Love we knew
So take the time back
And together we will save
What we built for you ...

You're beautiful, a champion
And I will go with you in the fire and in the water
And in water
You're beautiful, a champion
And in your name I will shout to heaven
up to the sky
-----------
If above the sun shines, I get excited
All my wishes from yesterday, I realize
Do not say, you can not
There is always tomorrow
Who is smiling at us already
I have no fear ...
-----------
I already understand everything
And only every morning when I wake up
Lying and listening maybe Dad is coming back.
Daddy, Daddy will stay ...
Dad come to me quickly
Father, Daddy.
-----------
Let me go back to my life
These are the ones
I remember how I hurt her lover
Believe me I had no intention
I will not dance with you anymore
But in my heart you have only my love
-----------
I was excited, afraid to breath
That's the first kiss
Oh, my lost youth
What did she do to me, what did she do?
My youth became lost
Since that first kiss
-----------
She'll always get over it
And in the language of love
We'll talk.
A-B-N-B ...
I dream and get up three words.
And what is the burden
-----------
The reader of the generations
A bailiff
He hears prayers
Innocent opinions
We have sinned before You
Have mercy on us
-----------
You will not fall
Come and be happy with me - we'll sing loudly
Give your hands, give your hands
We'll all be together tonight
We'll drink a glass of wine, have a drink
Come on, and we'll dance tonight
-----------
So is the parent
That one with the hi
Poetry fills
Libby forever
Leigh Leigh Leigh Leigh
parent

My pretty girl got back quickly
I knew girls who were more beautiful than you
I gave them all for you
My solitude in solitude can not anymore
My pretty girl got back quickly
My pretty girl got back quickly
-----------
His smile would forget the memories
And I'll know then that I found a cute girl.
Who will lead me safely through Netivot
Of a life full of happiness and love,
When time stands still for many hours
And I know then that I found a cute girl?
-----------
No, not that bad
Little frolic
The girl falls in love
And sing in an evening voice
And sing
In an evening voice
-----------
I'll look for myself, what a way to go
I'll find it and go on and on
It was over, it was
Memories are with me forever and ever
And tomorrow when I meet more and more people, I will make new memories with them ...
It was over, but there's a feeling ...
-----------
I can no longer answer
I'm trapped between the walls
She gathers her tears
She wants to cry alone
And I'm just a hopeful thinker
I'm just a hopeful thinker here
-----------
Love my heart where he is
Tell me where he went
Will he return or be lost?
Maybe he went and fell silent
Maybe he went and fell silent
Maybe he went and fell silent
-----------
My dreams are just yours
Holly would come today
Be in my arms for ever
Holly would come today
Be in my arms for ever

Matador
This senor passed without reentry
What is left of these
What remains
no no no
Nothing remains

That I should walk happily
My life has no value
Nothing works out for me
And I did not find a way
That I should walk happily
My life has no value
-----------
For her patience comes a reward for my patience and comes to Novell
I did not dare ask her why a supermodel poses
On tiptoe even when she kisses the wall
And she'll get everything whatever everything she asks
Photographed with a surfboard on the beach but never surfs
What a mess
-----------
With the same melody that never stopped
(pura vida)
Come what comes and what will come
Come what comes and what will come
Come what comes and what will come
Come what comes and what will come
-----------
Even if it feels you have nothing
You have everything and everything is good
It is permissible to stay away from reality
It is permissible to break with the uncertainty
Where are you going from where you come from
Do not surrender moving moves
-----------
If you try to forget, we can escape
It depends only on us whether to sink or shine
There's no one outside like you outside
Because only from you do I draw the strength
There's no one else out there like you
Oh oooh
-----------
Yeah i'v hear it all before
And i keep one foot out the door
It does not get easier
It's you getting strong
Come on
Cheap talk ...
-----------
I'm armed with beads
I got a doll and do not worry
I fling my ass off
It makes me feel good to see them move
I'm armed with beads
And I came to give a show
-----------
Amala Amalah Put me this song
Everyone talks about everyone how she makes me Zaman
Amala Amalah Put me this song
Everyone talks about everyone Everyone talks about it
Amala Amalah Put me this song
Everyone talks about everyone Everyone talks about it
-----------
Maybe we'll talk and we'll start to arrange
All this mess between us instead of giving up
Let's stop lying about another happiness wiping the tears because I'm sorry
You leave me no room for doubt
The light is closed and the room is empty
And my mind can not think so do well
-----------
In the state of Shakshuka Shlomit builds a sukkah for her
If Gila Almagor filmed with a wise Chanukah
So who will tell me what suits me
Who takes off the vib and who picked me up?
I do not even know who's listening
Who left long ago and who misses
-----------
Like a king without a crown
all the way from underground we gonna keep it loud
Im not here to play or waste all my day
You think that u really know who I am
I just called to say that im on my way
To see my true love Jerusalem
-----------
That innocence that disappeared from hypocrisy and falsehood
Because in a world of interests it is hard to see transparent
So I took a pencil and a notebook
And I began to paint a different reality
Immigrants get off the train
And apparently only the music remains
-----------
When will this cupid kick you
And the bachelor period could put an end to it
I do not know how long I'll have to wait
They say that each pot has a lid so you will start to remove worries
When they ask me why I do not think about the future
I'm dying to get married and make you a son just for them to stop saying
-----------
Again I do not fall asleep because it's the Madafucking jet lag
Free of the worries of a hundred thousand feet
He slipped with our problems from suffering
Life in illusions chasing the shekel
And I just want to
Be free from worries ...
-----------
I will cross the desert rivers and seas
Until the finish line until the last days
And in a few years
I'll build her a house with a garden and children
My brother is not looking for it,
Just give her the ...

If it's not in focus let's explain how it works.

All she remembers is that he had a tremendous rhythm
So instead of going crazy here half club

Among the few who still do it right is a man

Among the few who do it right
Jordi on Izzy looked at the microphone
To the few who do not fuck up
The way they move inside the clubhouse

Not everyone here will love us but it will not interfere with the cost
Building our place and ready ... to break the walls
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Give them some light and some light
Let him also wake up to another reality
Give them some light and some light
Let her feel that this is a period and she passes
Give them some light and some light
Give him only a good reason to smile again for truth

It does not matter what they tell me
Bottom line I ...

Until the day I stop breathing
Going on the brink of precipice and falling
I'll know I did everything

Get the child standing on the butcher without the green and without the heat who
Standing naked and doing it with pleasure. He is picking me up talking about the butcher and not getting tired because I have ..
I have a bit ... I do not have.
Joseph ...
Shit kid!
-----------
Everyone opened up to see what a mess he was
When I say Izzy you say or or
Fly up ah ah ah
Touch the dream to know to close your eyes and flow throughout the day and night
Chicken up ah ah ah
Touch the dream to know to close your eyes and flow throughout the day and all night
-----------
If you were looking for an advantage, give me a bit and a microphone
And you will find a solution I engrave on memory
You'll make me a place
Slowly up to the top
Want to create then make me a place
From which you can go on with it
-----------
I will never stop spitting words in all directions
Look for it on the radio and you will not find it on any frequency
I'll be in a boys' band that will still be better
Even if I sigh in the children's channel it will still be better
Even if I star among the stars of this festival it will still be better
And if you do not believe then you'll ask the audience to tell you who does it better
-----------
But again tears stream in front of the picture on the wall
Then you will know that in my heart your candle will always shine
I want to say sorry because I did not have time
I'm sorry I was silent that I held back
I remember you loving you in every corner of your heart with you
And again want to say thank you
-----------
But here I shot another house that they would not build in a decade
wild
Even if the page is torn
And even if the record is stuck
We'll get into it all week
Sure

You have to take air to breathe in the Big Biggies and you'll dream
Closes another chapter in life then Dear Diary Hello
Open doors with me
you can be my freedom key
Im coming with you
Life is a dream if you make it come true

Then I can write
Marior 's Dreams
Because if she leaves
Time will let the pain go through
Then I can write
Marior 's Dreams

Song lyrics past me to the wall
Words:
Izzy
melody:
Izzy
Izzy on the words like David on the harp from a piece of raspberry juice I fell on the mind again Rise in the LEVEL and not for the shekel If you call Marina Lee Call the flagship again Heats up the engine Marks more targets that will be in what hurts Play the words to those hard to swallow I still do not understand why It's hard for them to hear a scene that spits the track into a cassette. It resurrects the scene that died. The fat expressions do not want a diet. Plug the plug into the outlet. Because the genie fulfilled the wish. Unlike you. I do not work for the time. I touch the sky. In Time Tool it 's the rhythm of the song that sticks me to the wall There's no one in the whole town who does not know. It sticks to Bick by Bick ... Glues me to the wall. It glues me to the wall and it glues you to the wall? It glues me to the wall and it glues you to the wall? It glues me to the wall and it glues you to the wall? Well then let's keep the song still a hyper boy dropping a bottle of a liter of sky on me in wainer I beat blind again even Justin Bieber checks me the tweeter Another story about a good boy who became a killer when I make a dash so I spit fire out there by the feeling Izzy Mentally ill if I flow and start to pump them by mistake I cause the microphone to bleed. Stop dumb, it sounds jarring to me. So listen to Aya ... Because I have 1,000 records in my bag, from Snoop to Dray and Eminem to Nikki Minaj, because I'm a bit of everything. Me collage but if you catch me i'll catch the jazz It 's the rhythm of the song that sticks me to the wall ......... Again I throw the words on the place I still do not understand What did I talk about if I was in a hurry and a bit of digging? That you finished it does not mean I finished I have too many words on the tongue playing in my ear and it does not let sleep You dream of being first and dreaming of being a sailing king But there is also Izzy on the way if it was a man competition She would see that you are engraved on a dead grave in a living fence secretly in my warehouse with all the rest. Spreading beads to prevent dryness. If you try me, you will see that my conscience is free of principles. ...
-----------
I'm just a cook but you're the one who chooses to end up if you eat it
And sometimes it feels like magic
It's like taking momentum and flying
And I will never surrender to madness
Because God always protects me
"Let's see the hands in the air from side to side like that until the end of the song"
-----------
The wild and the 36 pastes me to the wall
Ear orgasm yo brother you are awesome
So no matter where you fly I do not leave you
I wrote dis to understand how much I love you
Because everyone here is thirsty for blood ...
Except for me I touched the sacred white color Earth Stop, bye.
-----------
5 AM begins this dream
I'll probably never forget that day
Always strive to do what is good for you
I grabbed a pencil and learned to write
I stood in front of a microphone and took air
I opened my mouth and began to sing
-----------
Let's take it a bit slower
They want everything and all at once
Let's take it slowly and raise it high
The brain twisted it can be heard
All at once without a drop of relaxation
Joseph on the Beat will warm the engine
-----------
I do not know how many microphones I have spit
Here and there, it's not just hot
When the music in the blood is a drug it's a drug that's a drug
He can not sleep and gets up and gets up
Keeping my head up
And they all ...
-----------
You sing best when you do it?
I do not need it because I hear it!
I can also sing I'm a cool rapper
Cracked cash full of women around
To see my audience raise their hands
Platinum album and not gold between the teeth
-----------
Lips a pair of eyes
Dimples in the cheeks
And her smile says it all
Sky couple of hands
Walk in the water
And the dogs are playing in the sand
-----------
Let me just go home and look in the mirror
And remember who I am again
Come save me
He wants to leave
Come save me
Why it takes you too long
-----------
One person changes with the help of others
So take it wherever you take it
Protected children in a sane world
Goals without coverage expect change
He will not come if we do not bring him
Waiting for good days
-----------
Wants to be the next to leave a scar here
Instead of letting us grow up quietly
Easy on the microphone
Joseph on the look
Big Fish
And this is for today.

Hop hop trolla
What a pleasure for me
I am her prime minister
Seeing them all from above
Hop hop trolla
So fun for me

Because tonight is night
Tonight we came to sing in an evening voice [what fun!]
Dancing and singing all of us, happy with the heart [what fun!]
So raise your hands and applaud
If you applaud, joy will be twice as great
Night and night ...
-----------
And it's a lot and it's so little
And how we will know if not our lives have passed
Have we worked in vain?
Will not our house be destroyed
Will you love us again?
And how will we know ...
-----------
All is ongoing
And the hardest nights under the blanket
You imagined knocking at the door
You dreamed that it was like a movie
The good ending will come
The good ending
-----------
like a drunk,
Until night passes.
You'll soon come to find out,
To the end of beauty
A song that lights me up at night.
That's how it is when you're in love.
-----------
Forbidden moments, secrets of the heart
Sometimes hard, no, I'm not leaving
I'm here to live
Sometimes I want to go back
Sometimes I want to go back
sometimes I...
-----------
Perhaps only in another and correct life
We would stay and not become nostalgic
It is true that there are no miracles and there is no answer
I'll meet you in a few years
And I'll get along well and have love
But I'll never be really quiet inside
-----------
As natural as I am, that real
In love with my hands to the bone
Tell me how another night passes
The heart wants you and your wake
And what are you doing tonight, night?
I'm still waiting…
-----------
The sky was singing, just for the two of us, we connected
And we touched love ...
When you're here talking to me
Eliminates all fears in me
When I play with you
How does everything get on with me
-----------
You have hands that know
Move the whole city
When you send kisses
Everyone is on tables
Doing your dance
Everyone knows
-----------
Masks and costumes how to feel guilty again
I'm no longer lying
Perhaps among all wars are fears
The suitcase loaded with lies
When will we start talking?
So let's start talking
-----------
Everything penetrates the body
You get into my heart and nothing hurts anymore
And there is air in the rooms
I'm not leaving you
You get into my heart and nothing hurts anymore
And there is room for hugs and kisses with you
-----------
You are in control of the fire
Capture each one
Do you look at me with disdain
Reverberator
All the songs of the earth in the world
One to the other
-----------
Until another day
once again
Time is covered
What is not there anymore?
To what will never be again
I drank a lot of wine
-----------
That she is addictive
That men were lost because of her

That she is addictive
But I have the same disease
But I have the same disease

No letter and decoration
Of yesterday
And tomorrow's hope tomorrow
Coming back to me.

I give and I did not give
Keeps him, so he will not hurt
The sky
Clouds changed the clock
So that it was an early, early hour
Go into life

Pray for this wonder
Please do not stop me ...
In the songs of Asa Tefila
Please grant me the child
Before I stop living
Please show me this wonder
-----------
Whatever heart is burning in you, go with what he tells you
Smile even if it hurts you how the heart cries in you
Whatever heart is burning in you, go with what he tells you
Smile even if it hurts you how the heart cries in you
Get out of it now, but miss
The heart may be burning because he always knows ....
-----------
Ahuva you play on my heart
My prayers are my days and my life
I swear to you forever
Dance with me tonight The sky opens
In the singing of angels
Calling on your behalf
-----------
How how did you happen to me so
After I've given you my whole life
How do I keep silent?
And that's me choking
How is how you do not save me?
I'm so engrossed in you
-----------
If I left you alone and not happy,
If I hurt you I'm sorry
For you I will die of love only for you,
In your beauty you finger the sky,
For you I will stab my heart in your eyes,
The peace of mind
-----------
Shows everyone love
If only you could know how convincing she was
Everyone loves only her
Kaaba on the shore of Traptoni
There's a party tonight
Kaaba on the shore of Traptoni
-----------
It's been two days since the sky
They bring blessings upon you and I have to thank God
That I have my life only to you comes
It's like love rain
And I just swear
And only you came
-----------
Falling in love with you
start over each time
Falling in love with you
Like an excited child
And forever whatever happened
I'll live with you
-----------
You have eyes that see everything from everything
And a sweet smile that does not hide
You have lips that know how to love close up
And a ring that only I know
Wakes up into the first night
What can I tell you today
-----------
Every weekend
Where are you at all?
Hi Mariposa
How are you flying?
Every weekend
Where's the butterfly?
-----------
On nights of love
It will be a piece of peace
No, no, no, no, it was not a coincidence
God is weaving, spinning
With gold threads above us
From The Begining Of Time
-----------
I swore, I promised
You made a vow no more
If I get there before sunrise
I will tie my life in your life
And be so happy
Look up at the light, up at the light
-----------
We sat in the yard
I look at your picture and look for a response
Because something is missing
I hear everyone telling me to let go
I know, I'll find another way to try
And I sing ...
-----------
My eyes tell me I'm here for you
A cover of Arcom gold to your heart, captivated by your charm
Every day is thrilled by your smile
How beautiful your eyes are
I will always be grateful
Because the unit every day every day
-----------
Without you ...
And you had me
And I had you
And nobody really had to
go
Without you ..
-----------
It is a love of a lifetime
The heart belongs only to you forever.
To the magic, to the goodness in you
Calling you, whatever you give me
Because I just have to.
I will never stop ...
-----------
He does not care what the day will be,
Or what tomorrow
Just let him look
Up on her now
How easily he is in love
Give her, let her, give her ...
-----------
A few more moments of satisfaction
And look, I love now
Think about both of us
What love we brought
Then you'll understand that I love you
I'm crazy about your love ...
-----------
Libby is ready to fly with you
I'm yours
Shiri is yours even if it is not so good
Stay
I love you, I'll sing my songs to you
You want me, I want ...
-----------
I will not hide anything
Everything I have, everything you have in the world
Wind and sun and sea
Without you does not exist
Everything I have
Everything in the world
-----------
Tonight is probably a full moon night
Even in the largest audience I will notice you,
I will know immediately that you will shine far and wide
I seem to be waiting for you
Love, I realized, has no rules
Tonight is probably a full moon night
