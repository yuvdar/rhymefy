Even if walls fall and you will not be near I will manage alone
Before you go, you will know no shame in escaping from reality
How much you know my love and I was also ready for you to die
And my mother always says you're a delusional type
She does not understand that here alone my heart is divided
Good to know you're getting stronger
-----------
If you lie to me, maybe I will
Let me give me more
When you get close to me it makes me feel good
Again she whispers that it's worth a sweet frenzy
Coming up to me is doing me good
Whispering that you should feel drunk again
-----------
And the tears are not happy
And if you want to bloom, run away
Because everything is in my possession
And if you want to rejoice, run away
Because I'm so upset
What it is to be in love with you
-----------
All night long we talked so we did not want to go to bed
And today he swears that he loves you no less than ever
For me this whole world you had to say
How do I love you here now for me This is my whole life Look at me and you'll see everything in my life I no longer have words
And today he swears that he loves you no less than ever
For me you're all this world to me I had to say
-----------
Come to me, tell me goodbye
Look at my book, leave a place
Come and take the silence
And if you do not know when, you'll come today
Do not be hard for me, you're like a diamond
I will not let you go again
-----------
Day and night, day and night is so excited about you
I only have you, and I'm yours
Day and night, night and night excited about you
I only have you, you are for me and I am yours
Day and night, day and night is so excited about you
Day and night, day and night is so excited about you
-----------
Where I did not look, I lost track of you
In prayer I raised my eyes to the heavens
Come back to me help me Gd
Do not make a mistake
I want you so badly, it's hard for me without you
Sad and bad in my soul
-----------
But you choke quietly, choking me with love,
Burning, she says, maybe it's not on purpose and with you something happens to me,
What is what happens to me because of you, you know that I love you
But you choke quietly, suffocating me with love
Burns, says, maybe it's not on purpose and with you something happens to me
What is what happens to me because of you, because of you
-----------
Drifting lost, when you wake up and know
She drifts after him and kisses his lips,
I do not know that all this is in vain. The guy is not in love
Oh girl, drifting like a child, in love wants to live
In his arms to be, like a child
Drifting lost, when you wake up and know
-----------
I feel like walking and putting on a ring,
Because all your friends are crazy you know
I want to hug you to be always your most want only to you, to you
Because I already feel like going to the sea to put a ring on you
Because all your friends drove me crazy, you know, I feel like it
Embrace you to be always your most want only to you, to you
-----------
Only you and I will burn the whole world, Olla, Olla, Olla, Olla
Give a sign with your eyes in your hands
Do not whisper anything that will not be with you tonight
Give a sign with your eyes in your hands
Do not whisper anything that will not be with you tonight
Do not tell me no, do not tell me no, do not tell me no
-----------
But she still fantasizes and gently suggests
The suitcase is packed, how I feel about Milan
Get in, put it in, put it in your pocket
Pamper, pamper, pamper, heart pounding
You will only let her buy clothes and presents
Load, load, load, Thank You And Let Me Kiss
-----------
And everyone thinks that living my life is the most fun in the world,
It's a bit more than perfect So right thank God,
Thank God I have no complaints,
it's not easy to be simple,
But more than that, it is not easy to be a human being
It rains outside and comes back from another performance
-----------
Try to believe, forgive, understand
I want you to return to my life
Trying to come back while imagining maybe you're here
What I did I let you go
Try to believe, forgive, understand
I want you to go back into my life
-----------
I'm all yours
And she says she'll play me just one more song
Because you have to go, do not forget me tomorrow, send me a good morning and meet in the evening
And she says play me Give me another good reason to be with you
Because when the rhythm comes up again she says
I'm all yours
-----------
The rescuer yells at you
Shoots curses why
Because no one here understands what he wants
From each corner he composed twenty songs together
Mingle but everyone finds
I am free and built and married to everything that happens here
-----------
She'll come back to us
What she has here will not give up
She was last seen
Thirty thirties
In a storm of emotions
About Insanity ...
-----------
And even if you do not have some whiskey, that's good too
Always like a flower then I'll have some good water for you
Just give me a piece of you, I tell you
Even one sunbeam in the winter for me is good
Leave me a little smile. I do not need the majority
And the universe listens to how in my heart the future is only for both of us
-----------
The thousand loves and another one that I did not realize
I drive to the city and do not wait for me
You get carried away every day between love and madness
And finds no small corner of happiness in life
You give me a lot of conversations at night in the living room
And you are greater than life
-----------
And at night, everything suddenly comes back to me
What's up? I wanted a little to ask about us
How do we overcome all the feelings between us
At night I looked for everything
The places we could be in,
Where is he? Where were we wrong and what did you have left?
-----------
And she says
What have you seen in life?
What have you done to this day?
How many loves it was that made you breathe
She asks questions looking for a response
If I fit her Bull and I'm so different
-----------
Go out with you for a date
Because there's something special about you
You love me a little bad
And always drinks with him
Why do not you envy me?
And only you stay with him
-----------
I found myself sitting and painting her image
So I drank another drop and tried a little to run away
I have exhausted the pain and want a little to rejoice
I found another source that gives me strength
Alon de Loco and Farr is the time to scream
Another drop and a little more give me a drink
-----------
Give a little sign that
You've got everything in the end
And then I saw you walking down the street
And I did not know you to go
It does not matter it does not matter
You have nothing
-----------
What has already been lost
Nothing is scary anymore
Not even darkness
From experience she will explain
Everything has a price
Yes to freedom as well
-----------
A little different from the first meeting
It's true that you've never been before
How do you not understand what you do not understand
Maybe I love too much and suddenly think to yourself it's not worth it
You do not know what I'm going through
Tell me what
-----------
Tell me, who is close to me who will hear this heart
For those words and songs
Oh God, make it easier for me
Saved me from the hardships I awake at night
Without food and drink
I dream about the period of my youth, which will not come
-----------
So I will not give you another reason to go
From me tonight night every day I sit on the fence waiting for you to come
Sometimes a person is afraid to break what is going on in my heart on the street no longer hear the notes you played on the piano
A truck unloading empty crates I gather everything into my heart
And a neighbor asked about her for a day or two
To feel so lonely is not familiar in my heart and creeps creeps
-----------
Do not go alone
I can not lose such love
Again calling you back I'm not afraid I caressed your face like in a dream
And the taste of your lips accompanied the day
Who are you going to lie to and Mr
Come back to me it's not too late
-----------
My friends all my friends
Take, and wait for a moment to be free and happy again thoughts and illusions and feelings again
They throw me away to look for both your hands
The mothers-in-law who always embraced me
When I was a bit inconsiderate and selfish what I thought - to myself is not the good that will reveal to you the truth is the demons
Of yours who now want to get out
-----------
And she broke her
Look where she came from
Between Florentin and Rosh Ha'ayin
On the bus she dreamed for the time being
And she wakes up
At the beach on the Sea of ​​Galilee
-----------
We did not have any choices
Either way we got along
When I did not have a token I called out the window
A kind of simple life like that
And when we dreamed, we did not forget to live
I wonder if you remember
-----------
Shlomo is a little broken and you write another tear and do not repent
There are things that the heart can not bear
And you know I'm almost collapsing and come out you have a quiet and common soul
A tear tears a peaceful life
A sad soul must retreat
You do not see there is no choice
-----------
A voice that curls up - like a prayer, let's live today - without fearing too much
Let us be happy today - because we will not know when
What will come upon us - and what tomorrow will be remembered - with the melody
Of good days - of love and wonder
Children's laughter - smiling eyes
Heat of people - the embrace of hearts
-----------
You and I will live a world conqueror sometimes with you I travel to hot places
The end of the world Sometimes I shine
Inside me I know there is no perfect
Sometimes with you my life in the moment changes in my will
No frenzy dances with me and time runs away
And do not leave me until nightfall
-----------
I was naive, I did not think it was possible to lose
I wanted so much and was afraid more than I would fear
A few tears in your mind some hopes in my eyes
I fought to return only to you so that you would not advance without me
I was naive, I did not understand that this is how you should love
Now I'm more able to leave
-----------
In the end everything will come from above
You 're just a man
So even if you think I am
A little closed in my sunken world
I swear if you were not here
I was dead, or gone like a mirage
-----------
And if you wait for me and you give up
So I and the two of us are facing the whole world
You go somewhere far away
Taking sentences we liked
I'm sorry to say goodbye
If you gave up everything we dreamed
-----------
And you went
You dance in front of me and then you stand up
Suddenly a phone from a mother must answer
What will be with you, Yama?
I'll never change
We built only do not change
-----------
Throw her the words she scratched for her to scratch
The heart, and if you see tears do not wipe
Just do not let the moment pass she will not remember
That you bought her an expensive drink at the club
Throw her the words she scratched for her to scratch
The heart, and if you see tears - do not wipe
-----------
Now you play the songs that make you feel good in your soul
In the evening you celebrate and I alone have forgotten what love is
In your dreams the queen with a heart of stone
All your lovers have already fled to God
You keep your most beautiful times
My heart was shattered
-----------
The happiness that lost this pain on the side
All that I need if I end up alone
And maybe you'll fall in love with me again
And maybe you'll make promises to me
Do not just stand there alone and the spirits
And maybe you'll just break my heart or do something with him at least
-----------
But there is one for which I was destroyed
And builds everything from scratch
Please excuse me mother
If I have not been there always and I have not
If I did not get to say or say too little love
Forgive me Mother if sometimes I broke your heart
-----------
How I felt frustrated when a film I was forbidden to take
So my story suddenly took a turn
When she moved in with Ronit, happy and proud
Celebrates pride parade
I feel lost, lost here
Without you, I have nothing. Wait a little. This is not the end of the story
-----------
So excuse me, I will continue on my way
And I'll look for a woman because you're just not for me
What can I do? I'm such a simple guy
We only want to love you and not be judged
And love is not a game and not for me
So come on, Salamat, warm regards to my mother-in-law
-----------
That the road had gone without me
Today everything is free and everything is open
Everybody dies for love
Drowning with myself in the glia
And falls in love with her slowly again
Again alone ...
-----------
The most beautiful moments of life
We will return together to dream, just do not forget
God from Above aims everything alone
God I want her to forgive and can not anymore
Alone alone if you do not have someone to reach out to me
Slowly and slowly I suddenly catch the one
-----------
I continue to collect all his memory
Do not ask for more forgiveness
How it went on for years
Days have passed you do not care
Do you also hear my voice singing
Is it hard for you to say it's over?
-----------
This is the power of love you know
There is no such thing as a stronger world
It changes world orders and no one in it touches
Everyone was injured and sometimes tearful
It is the power of love with joy and pain
Just keep it close to your heart
-----------
Today when I'm good without you
I fly leaving hands and not afraid
Be what I am
Today I feel good without you
I fly to the sky
Not going back to being what I was with you
-----------
The smell of perfume lingered
And your image in the window reminds me of days
Pure love and eternal love
The smell of perfume remained floating
And your image in the window reminds me of days
Pure love You have always loved me ...
-----------
She orders the opposite of both of us and just complains about the heat
What kind of fever might we ask? She lives in a rented apartment
Close to the road to peace we will book an account
Between everything that happens we built an air conditioner because of the heat and some heat
Maybe we'll go to the room if you want. You can stay here to sleep, too
Which night to sleep is not an expense
-----------
His soul
There is no one like you from India to Ramat Gan
There is nothing like Dina Achla Dina is no longer in the world
You know that for me the armrest I'm always here for you
My whole life is only for you
Great Dina my heart ...
-----------
With a tan of shukovo and a bathing suit of rubber
Shukobo where Bo Boo Boo Bo
The rubber is also well both well as well
Shukobo where Bo Boo Boo Bo
The rubber is also well both well as well
What happened?
-----------
And how the stars sew a dress on her (Kwai, Kwai)
Just like you I was looking for no question (Kwai, Kwai)
And I wish I had only a word
Kwai, Kwai, Kwai ...
Finish her!
Fatality, Flawless victory
-----------
Last time you have a solo
Everyone looks at me Leigh
And it's not because I'm beautiful (he's not pretty)
Does not take too long
Peace be upon you and Namaste
Goodbye, hello X3
-----------
A day passes and trouble passes, for every nerve has an end.
When clouds cover the sky, and all the sun's light goes out,
The boy grew up, I left the house, and here came the rain that fell on us.
Everything for the best, everything will pass, I have long been afraid of the cold.
Take a breath, it will help, just give good and good will return.
Not always easy, not always good, but it always makes me, makes me think.
-----------
There is an expensive situation if you will be with her directly,
There's an expensive situation if you know how to sing.
Or oh or ah or ah - everything is fine todo bum.
Oh or ah or ah or - Tudu Boom Tudu Boom.
Or oh or ah or ah - everything is fine todo bum.
Oh or ah or ah or - Tudu Boom Tudu Boom.
-----------
Say who is the most beautiful in the whole city?
They answer me: She's the prettiest I know!
Every weekend you come here
Like the honey you bring sweet
And if you let it happen
Tonight it's me and the trumpets
-----------
Sure you say it was all just.
Sure you say, you must be saying.
And also, if you say it was just,
This time together he did not disappear,
I do not care what you say no matter what you think,
I suggest you listen, even though you do not owe me anything.
-----------
Walak does not complain, even with:
We do not have Ibiza, there is not much in Visa,
But there is the breeze, Eilat - and the Sea of ​​Galilee.
So if you feel hot,
Get organized on a car and a bathing suit,
There is no such summer - in another country.
-----------
Jordi the driver Thorne,
Ben-El always buys nonsense and spent,
Stat Boy, Stat Boy ..
Hold on a minute!
Where is Stat Boy?
Sailing, we forgot it in Haifa ...
-----------
You're not the only one in the world, you'll understand,
I have a speech that you will not believe!
Everything they say about you is not interesting,
I call you Barbie and you answer me Ken.
It's obvious she answers me yes ...
It's obvious she answers me yes ...
-----------
Understand the mood
You know I'm not
I'm not like money coming and going
Itai is much safer
And if you tell me yes
Get me a guitar I'll start playing
-----------
I love you laughing
You illuminate the universe to me
Tell me what you're ashamed of
Talking love
just me and you
you and I
-----------
She has the smell that makes me a bit predictable
I'm no longer insane
Through the brown eyes she speaks almost. I do not need words
I hold her hand and then whisper to her So pick up the night Look at me every day ... I'm over tonight The day has come
I still have another last dance power
Because it always makes me feel good to be close to your heart
-----------
I'll have a house to get rid of the fears
And probably grew up over the years
We will be together to laugh at life and it will make us feel better and closer
Be like I love
And you're beautiful to me today, you're like a dream
Like something good coming
-----------
Would you like to come back? We already said everything. Tell us what remains
I'm so close so what are you looking for?
I do not care anymore maybe it's better to overcome
Lying a little to myself in reality laughs and how still rain dripping on my heart
Outside I'm strong
Know how to play the game
-----------
He goes far with her without knowing why
Watch the end of the evening evening
When everyone walks in quiet silence
How with her always this morning came between the sheets
I'm a bit confused
And it feels like a dream to me
-----------
While there was still something to say
I feel like living with you
All the evil to forget
And hope it will be good
Even if you have no faith
And this is another day that pursues a day that pursues the day ...
-----------
Your eyes hide what is happening inside
You are strong, not a weak world
Give me your hand Open your hair I'll give you another little sister smile
Maybe for me too
Give me your beloved songs
My little sister
-----------
And if I keep silent? All those alleys
Your shadow pursues hours and is cold to me
I fell into that abyss
Heroes also need space
I was the one who was afraid of the liver
you're not answering me
-----------
I'm not out of time (a new guy comes to the neighborhood) I'm new to the neighborhood
There is no one to reassure me (there is no one to calm down, here he comes)
I just got there and my voice sounded Libby announce (here he is, here he comes) so let's get me here
She says come there
How I'm always ready
I do not run out of time
-----------
So come here, a little round
Maybe we'll dance like in Havana and not like Greece
And how the heat suddenly rises (ascending - la - la)
The heart begins to fill (full-la-la)
What does this round do to her (what does it do to her)
It's as sweet as a candy, like a caramela
-----------
Longings mixed with pain, return to me
On my bed at night
I thought God
Only the smell remained at night
You have a lover in your heart
No longer a guest
-----------
Maybe you do not remember as much as I do
How like in a movie only the plate you see in me the truth that I have in my heart just for you
And then I was thinking of giving up the truth
You looked at me hypnotically
You did not tell me anything, but you did not lie either
I understood it was you, it was you
-----------
Me and you in a small world that never ends
And you whisper to me salsa
It flows in my blood
The butcher decides again to set the night for us
Suddenly I like your smile
Love the dance Keep talking ...
-----------
Collections may be packed
You'll call a taxi and you'll smile to the sky
Such love is certainly not a mistake
Five flight ...
Such love can only be found in heaven
Put seat belts on
-----------
Go on the bar, do not think about tomorrow
She just wants to dance
And that makes her sexy
Makes her beautiful
Shut your eyes
Dancing barefoot
-----------
She looks at his face and he is beautiful to her
As if the signs of time had not harmed him
Sometimes he caresses her at night
Or maybe out of a dream he was reaching out
She wakes up beside him
And she knows how to say that together is the opposite
-----------
Whatever you want
But at the end grant and hold me in your heart
And they will not give me love in the millions for you
Only pure love from your eyes
Bring me to you close
And it will be good for us to be good
-----------
Sounds that play sadly
They decorate another day passing him
Meanwhile in the early autumn come to a star turned off lit up
The clouds painted my eyes
Great walls that shattered
The emotions that were exposed left a red trail to you ...
-----------
So leave my heart
He got used to being hurt
He has not liked anyone long ago
Do not give up on the dream and surely
I will not be with me
I'm alone
-----------
I do not care about time
Tonight we do not go to bed until first light
It's a white night I tell you here
There are no limits and no time because it is our night
White Night No one will sleep
It's already one time we just started ...
-----------
You and I should watch every minute
I was without you half crazy
Now love, now love
From now on the colors of happiness will rise
We embrace the morning light
And your voice will pray that we continue to the next day
-----------
Or or or or or ...
I'm here for you already coming back
Can not take a minute without you
And the day that is left is only going to end
So come and be with me
And we will be good
-----------
It's so hard for me to enjoy you getting my thoughts dirty
In the middle of a beautiful day my heart is so thirsty for love
Everything is so simple and complicated
I want to know what you're doing now
When you're not with me anymore
Who took the place that had not been mine for a long time
-----------
We are blood in the arteries
Walking together distances, it does not leave
Dreams, youth
And your poems are in my heart
I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you so much
-----------
sea ​​of ​​Love
So let my beauty sing to you
I will thank you for the good you have
God will give you strength
Be happy
and also...
-----------
Who are you talking to? Tell me who you're waiting for
Days pass by plane takes off to Barcelona
Sends you roses tied to the ribbon and tell where you are
If you'll excuse me and give me one more chance
I'll pick up hugs of love for you
And now is the time to come back
-----------
Wherever you go you will not have a mother ...
Go to my children and you'll be a little careful
Take my blessing with you
Do not forget my mom's here for you
So you will fulfill all your dreams
And when you go ...
-----------
Go ahead and take the time
Yes, you will be happy that
All that is left to live the moment
As you wish ...
Get up now and take everything
You picked up a big way out!
-----------
So just with you I'm still, I'll win.
And if it's a war, I'm on your side
Let's not make it so complicated
And if this is war, I do not run away anymore
And only with you, yes only with you, I will win
If this war will be on my side ....
-----------
I will devote all my days to your commandments
Spread out like a spear because you are the Redeemer
God Almighty strengthen my hands
And give me the strength to stand
On the way I went I never broke
Only you with me always will not fall
-----------
Always tell when your heart hurts
Always when time stops
Do not be discouraged. Think about tomorrow
And life will smile to you
And all the people
Tamir will tell you
-----------
Become a time that disappears with the clock
And what remains is a hole in the heart that does not close
And the hidden hope
Only Gd will decide now what to do
Go back and get another little hug
To be the one you loved all your life
-----------
Because all I have
And I have no other love
One word makes me happy
And only with you I feel stronger
Your love gives me all the strength
And not ready for you baby give up
