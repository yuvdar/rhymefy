I'm getting lost in the dead hours
The forecasters can not manage to be precise. I continue
Getting wet in my memories of patience is about to end
In this dance on a floor of glass
One can literally count breath and breath
Just from the moment you came out the door
-----------
Get up, man, chicken on the world
You have the power to rise and do not sleep
If you sink and time stops
Raise your head up and talk
Believe in yourself and do not break
Give me a smile and everything will work out
-----------
I wanted us to love forever
Come and reach out
Sorry I did not try
And with you I was wrong
But inside me I knew you
I will not give up on both of us
-----------
Go another corner of the colada from the bar
His speech reminds you of that
From last week
Well, why are you running away?
I give you no take
No one from anyone
-----------
Waiting for me at night
Dreams and memories I carry in my backpack
What tomorrow will bring to him and what will be in store for me
I have a song I have a guitar and a wind in my wings
They will follow me with all my steps
And my prayers
-----------
Where shall I go?
The whole city already knows you broke my heart
I lost my mind and paid with pain
On the roads he drives the farthest from you
I'm already going crazy on the streets in your name
And all because of you
-----------
And if you have already taken seven solitude
I'm here waiting for greetings
Moon comforting when you laugh
With you reality always bites
If only there is a dream in your heart to love
I am here waiting
-----------
Just come back again,
For a final hug,
Let me breathe another look at memory.
Explain to me once more,
Ask God,
Why all his angels are heroes ...
-----------
It's not too late
And what will you tell me tomorrow
Sunday afternoon sun in the eyes
With Karin Blanche
A phone from Suzie came to you and a hot tub
Motivating the car another sharp turn to the right and parked a pulse on the door she opens
-----------
So what if you fell, get up.
People try, do not settle for
People fail
Envy growing
Again the gate closed
And it seems, everything seems to be over again ...
-----------
Let's cross the border
To the freedom that was bound
And only secretaries
Outside you can be
Free of fear
Only when the shadow and I are together
-----------
Forget to forgive, I'm calling you
Like a drop in the desert
Covering me alone in dark darkness
Imagining you as light at the end of my life
I lose heartbeat from light thought
We laughed and you were in my arms
-----------
The sail is blowing wind
If I knew what you had in your heart
This year in a white dress
Dancing friends are doing happy
Tears of joy would trickle away
And the heart will smile if you just say
-----------
When will you be back?
A silence that cuts
A passion that grows
Even in the summer you threw me in the burning face
The wind did not rejoice
I still breathed for you
-----------
And if you have trouble with them
Be whole with yourself
The angels of heaven came toward you
There is a smile on your lips, a light in your world
Do not forget where you came from, do not pretend
Because at the end of the day we are all small
-----------
How do I want you?
It's hard for me without you
When I'm with you it feels right to me
You always do me good
And without you I can not
Tell me what the end will be
-----------
To see you standing before my eyes
The sun that shines my life
I walked among the paths and looked
I have reached the end of the road now
With no way out I remained praying
What will be the end of myself I ask
-----------
And you are silent
I searched among hills and hills
I asked my friends dreamy dreams
About me and you girl
And a small light in the distance gives me a sign
Here it is
-----------
Maybe the day will come when we can smile
All that's left is to live beside you again
He is still looking for the way to the heart
Forget everything and live beside her again
Perhaps the day will come when he will complete it
And he would enter her loving room again
-----------
This moment is again a deterrent
The light we created is pale
It's so hard for me to understand
How we have become distant
And if you were not happy
Who promises you where you will be
-----------
Your beauty is still seen with your steps in your imagination
Happiness is on you and loneliness embraces
You never forget when you're happy without me
Who are you approaching?
Soon I will crash quietly
Hope you are well, good with him
-----------
Maybe you'll come to me and we'll talk
My heart is yours I will not give up
I thought there was a connection between heaven and heaven
If you are mine then how do you give up
I knew you were forbidden fruit from the besieged paradise
Tell me nicely what you think of what you think
-----------
Without you I have no day to breathe
Your eyes are beautiful only after you
You always give more than anything small
Every little thing you only mentioned every little thing
You always give more. I will not give up
And in my heart you touched every little thing
-----------
Every dying day
thinking about you
I will not forget the girls
We moved into the neighborhood
And how good they stayed
A sea of ​​memories
-----------
There are many beautiful in the world ...
What animal is a snail?
Come on out,
Just look at you
Get out of the snail
Get out and see what ...
-----------
And everyone will remember
What everyone remembers
When others were able to say
What they said
And what they did not say
And I have not said everything yet ...
-----------
Won off, won as a faction
You wonder, Ayelet, the charm
White from the snow stars
I wish you a tenderness
White from the snow stars
I wish you a tenderness
-----------
How he could find more
A pair of eyes like that
Ayelet Love Books
What did your head cover with a purple scarf?
What your eyelashes are sad about
And your neck is bent like a stem.
-----------
All in all a little little girl
And dreams are beautiful between leaves and branches
Good night little little girl
She does not know anything
You do not know anything
achinoam
-----------
Not happy with these thousands.
Which we were to die for.
No, because only his life, the refugees of the sword
He got on the beach a measure.
But also his life, an island in the evening,
He retaliated.
-----------
Brother, how good and soft,
A closed room again opened.
To describe what is in flora
There is no word in the Bible.
Brother is a word, yes a keyword
When I'm with you.
-----------
And he is not even happy without end
And who knows?
But something sang in it
And he sang
And gets him a bit lost
With all the rest
-----------
Do not know why and understand how
How it did not work, how now it goes
You can not bear to stop dreaming
See Peace will come to end
You, you
Love you
-----------
Whoever I wish I will be forever
To this day I will not catch
How did you run away?
You married Yosl Gross the Hasid from Safed ...
Ora, Ora, as the Torah commands
Ora, Ora ... a kosher stork!
-----------
What time will tell
Maybe we should give it more time.
One day we saw light at the end of the tunnel
A small glowing spot shines with a small fire
We approached slowly and refused to believe,
Angels stood in the doorway of the happy, believing ministers
-----------
Love me too
Now autumn knocks on the door
The holidays are approaching
There is a white cloud in the sky
The grenades are already red
So take me ...
-----------
Night comes and the stars are on again
The shadows were already long
If you look close through the shutters
You'll see they're still there singing and playing
Ovaldi Ubalde who came
Welcome
-----------
Darkness will envelop your face in black
My love is white-necked.
In the orchards already bloom perfume
We'll go there my love, we'll go tomorrow
In the quiet white I shall call you gladly
My love is white-necked.
-----------
With a loving heart they will throw a flower at you.
You may be small
But our speech was firm,
And every smile we have is a holiday
You have an interest here with construction workers
Who love you to the top of the roof.
-----------
She does not love me
She does not like
Is not
And then back, love
A face, many faces
But her back turned to me
-----------
And all of them together!
Helena, Helena, Helena - free love
Helena, Helena, Helena - Is good enough for me
And last time!
Helena, Helena, Helena - free love
Helena, Helena, Helena - Is good enough for me
-----------
So give me the answer if you know what should I do
I sit with my friends waiting for a better day
I lie in the sun waiting for a better day
I lie in the sun dreaming of another way
So give me the answer if you know what should I do
I lie in the sun waiting for a better day
-----------
But if you see the eyes sometimes
A falling star - it's a bright death.
Adam believed here in the evening whisper,
Hear the air choir in heaven,
He left his house and stood on the way
See if a star and death are alike.
-----------
Poor, sleep
Hug your father
Poor, sleep
Because he loves only you
Poor, sleep
Good night
-----------
Just not a prison, for God's sake -
I am not guilty, I am not guilty.
Judge! Judge!
This is the truth and the whole truth,
So why do you put me in prison?
I am not guilty, I am not guilty.
-----------
He brushes his shoes, comb his hair,
And walks with a stick and a hat.
Morning. light wind.
And here -
A green house, a red door,
Glyn Glynn, Glynn Bellmon.
-----------
He asks, "So what are you doing here?"
Her lips whisper: "I'm with you."
I'm silent. Lips is biting
I'm silent and so heavy
Suddenly she turns and walks away
And only I remain silent there.
-----------
Why not, why not now
Which will probably come tomorrow.
Avshalom, Absalom
Like a dream, like a summer dream
Why not, why not, why not come now
Which will probably come tomorrow.
-----------
I will feel a strange dampness in my eyes, Dummy mumbled, and Yadav
Avriemel, when will we have a son? We are an old couple
Every woman my age has been pregnant at least eighteen times
Avraham smiles and is silent, sucking his pipe with his mouth
Security, my partner, God willing even a broom shoots
Even a broom shoots, even a broom shoots
-----------
And makes me signs
Your gaze glances at me
Franti T. Fermi
Avento Pinot Fredri
Avishag, Avishag
Avishag, Chow.
-----------
And dancing is the whole job
Because samba is dance.
There is nothing like the samba to take peace
There is nothing like the Samba, yes it is an experience
It may be an illusion, but it does me good
South America on the map.
-----------
And it may be that it will not return
To the house where you live.
And your hours - the wonders of time,
And your hopes - the wonders of light,
Maybe you will not drink any more,
You're the drunk, the drunk.
-----------
His mother (he had a mother)
Will it be white?
There is soil and depth and height.
There are forests, tigers and parrots.
There are loves and songs to fill
And there is Yochai - selling pistachios.
-----------
We eat a cooked meal
Perhaps only the dog is hungry for cakes.
Her lips are thin and for a thousand times
No child tells her: Tell me a story ...
On the lap of the asphalt, the dog puppy snorts
Without disturbing public safety.
-----------
But today I am different
An adult and a guard
Maybe he'll be different and we'll know more
A moment without thinking
What should and how will be
Just give and receive Edna caresses
-----------
His voice comes again
I say it would be worthwhile
Because he sang: "Give me your hand
I do not want more unrequited love
No more want a broken heart
Do not want another painful hope "
-----------
So just with you
I can be happy
only with you
I'm willing to forgive
only with you
And that's how it will always be.
-----------
A great sun and a gloomy night
There are loves and there are wars
Once upon a time it is like this and once again it is so and again Amir
Now you're so young
Maybe you have not yet .... know .... that there is sadness in the world
And there is also a child who is hungry and dead
-----------
Emotion: Our Nights Rigby Darkness.
And empty space - - - (Our window is open
For the sake of looking at what emptiness void).
I looked for you at night and in the wind,
I was looking for you in the wood
And void.

Smiling smiles in all directions
And always, always in business.
Sitting on the fence
He looks over here, peeks there
A newspaper reader hears news in time
Wrapping himself in a smoke screen.

all night
I will wait and day the flock
Ashka
And I'll wait for Rachel.

Constantly thinking how much money he earns
And heavy in the soul, the battles are lost
He does not have time to hear the music in nature
He does not have time to see the sea and the sunset
He does not have time to go into cinema
You will always find him at work
-----------
Sitting in front of the paper, I see you fall
I look at the paper and I do not get a sound
O my land, I have born the fetus,
You broke my heart into small pieces
We had a dream, and now he is gone,
I'm so sad I feel like crying
-----------
Time to live in love
And a time for a crime
For all time
And time for every object
And under the sky
For all time
-----------
Between indifferent and sinful hearts.
Like you are just a toy at home,
For children to play.
Chatter, parrot Yossi,
Nachmani as an olive,
My heart is empty today.
-----------
We do not give up and want everything
But I like to be home
With the tea and the lemon and the old books
Yes, I like being at home
With her beloved and with the same habits
Love to be home
-----------
Looking for me, I'm kneeling ...
I'm on my knees
Trying to see the good things
Trying to see the little lights
In the great darkness, looking for a way for me
Trying to see the good things
-----------
Will not our house be destroyed
Will you love us again?
And how will we know
If there is hope
When we come, when we come
An answer was found
-----------
And not to be better
And I did not want to hit
And I did not try to attack
I was not looking to seduce
Nor did I try to flatter
I did not try to condemn ...
-----------
When she rose up, a branch would fall on me like a handkerchief
And I will bow to her and Arim.
And I know that to the sound of the drum,
In deaf and painful trade cities,
One day I will fall another wounded head to pick
We smiled from among the chariots.
-----------
Sometimes you too
And tomorrow the sun would shine through the clouds
And you'll feel better
Feel warm
A wave chases a wave and breaks
you too...
-----------
Now I have nothing in the world
I have nothing.
Bring me under your wing
And be a mother and sister to me
And your sanctuary was your chief refuge
My distant nest of prayers.
-----------
And you do not need any document from me
I'm just yours I'm just yours I'm yours ...
We were children when we knew each other
And like the little dreams we grew up
With you takes the time
And again my time takes you

Look at me, I live in a dream
My friend, Ya'ani, and everything costs me
Ya wali ya wali, you're like a diamond ...
Tom Tum Tacam Tum Tacam There's a party tonight ...
-----------
The time went by
Memories that pass
Of what remains is the little that remains
Imagine the moment when you enter
And I bought a cake and lit candles
And I thought maybe you'd come off / you did not change at all
-----------
Until you,
Up to the horizon
Like your image that rushed me like a pulse.
Do not turn,
do not Cry,
Do not turn off ...
-----------
Blue and white flag, Star of David your symbol
Jerusalem is a capital to the world, a crown of light to your head.
Sobo circles, sing her hymns
Who celebrates this eye years, my Israel.
Turn on the lights, sing in the squares
They raised all the flags, my Israel
-----------
And the most beautiful and beautiful at the party ...
We promised after ...
You want us to fly to Copangan
Beach parties and chaos
Dance with Paul Moon on the sand
Running runners of alcohol ...
-----------
I do not want to go there anymore
Do not say there are many fish in the sea that will hurt
Do not tell me yours broke
Do not say it's too late to go
Do not say it's all over
Who knows what tomorrow will not tell
-----------
Tel Aviv, Festival, Beer Sheva Carnival
From north to south, let's raise the place
Because by sunrise we will not stop dreaming,
You should know that we only have the day.
Come with me and live big -
If I have you then I already have everything. (X2)
-----------
Just not for nothing
Every moment in the world is a world
And in the meantime I have Divine Providence
Because nothing comes to me
Just not for nothing
From the king of the world, king of the world
-----------
Let everyone talk about you and me
But between us you also occupy with only pants and undershirts
I bought you a duty full of Beauty
You said you liked to be the nicest party
Gucci's shirts and prices killed me
I returned on the cheapest ticket train standing up and happy
-----------
Every Friday you buy flowers, still like you like
Just like you are just a matter of time
Still complicated, I think I think too much
thinking of you
Still in the same apartment, still exactly the same person
Only without you
-----------
Because at all parties
There is no one like you like you
One
So tell me I'm tired of asking
How can we find another one like that?
One like you
-----------
That there is nothing more than you
Let me hug you and kiss you and love you
Let me take off with you to heaven and shut your eyes
What can I feel today?
There are no words to describe us
One picture on the phone will not absorb our madness either
-----------
I did not think there would be a reality in which she would close the door
If I'm wrong the nightmare of my life begins
Tonight you are leaving and I am like a madman standing in a frightened room
The night you leave leaves me alone and their blood is confused
Tonight you're leaving and I'm like a madman standing in a non-breathing room
And I know that only I am guilty
-----------
Life is just a corridor and do not see any ray of light
What would be how I lived alone
Thieves Thieves Thieves stole my night
Poor robbers robbers robbed me of the day
Thieves Thieves Thieves stole my night
Poor robbers robbers robbed me of the day
-----------
Just do not leave me even if I forget
Like Daddy never runs away from his son who needs him so much
Everyone is singing now
Oh yoy yo yoy yo We will not get lost We will not get lost just because of him
Oh yoy yo yoy yo yoy nothing is lost Nothing is lost that has it
Ouyi Yoyoy is here in the world
-----------
God, what are you doing to me?
I'm going crazy already
Wants to be normal
We do not know
You send a sweet smile here and there
But between us you make fun of me
-----------
Such love
I'm like a child who wants to want me
Hold my heart because my hands call you Come and hug me
In the moonlight
The way I want you
How I find in you a charm that no one has
-----------
She walks back and disappears again
Shutting me down
I'm insane
Do not go
Can not wait
He did not fall asleep at night
-----------
If only I could
If I could be blind when I saw you go with another
Only to you, only to you, only to you
Look again at your eyes
Only to you, only to you, only to you
More heart only wishes to you
-----------
Of an old generation
You met at a private party in Jaffa of a friend from the army
At first sight I knew that among you it was love
Look, girl, how did you get his head off?
And because of you he does not sleep for a week anymore
The parents is not going to meet and will try to at least understand
-----------
Erladierlde
So let's have a good time
Erladierlde
The fire of your gaze is overwhelming and I am excited here
You can not live a day without you
If you'll just give me a chance to correct the mistake I made just in front of you
-----------
Even though you've forgotten me, you've forgiven me
Look where all the fears now led me even
Even if you do not like it
Your lies now will save me
Tell me I'm yours even if it's an illusion
You'll understand that you do not mind if you do even
-----------
Outside air of July and August
And Eilat is dry and hot

I and you are already interested
We go on another romantic trip
I'm sorry for the time

Bass Aulili Alhaya Baithibini
And feel the feeling in my heart
Tell me tell me about you
What am I now in your life?
You know, I still have the power and it's not another passing moment
Dime ei konta me ustedes Como juo aora in tu bida Ke sabes ketengo fuerse este no momento ke pasa
-----------
Among all the anger and silences it is very hard to swim
Drowning in a sea of ​​secrets
I will save you from you even you are allowed to make a mistake
No one will hurt your pain like me
With you for the rest of my life in wealth and poverty
I hope it's not because of me, it's not because of me
-----------
Nights you'd wait for me for hours
Trying to hide the tears
Looking for answers in the walls
On nights when darkness hid memories
And fear makes noises
And it's hard to see
-----------
You have the same order here and that is enough
He wants to excite you
Even if they do not call him Zvika
He'll arrange for you every day to give you a shot
If you can open a door to leave the sword in the holster
If you can open a door to leave the sword in the holster
-----------
Six thousand miles, such a distance I did not expect
NY city, NY City, NY City ....
Give me the strength to hang out with you tonight baby
Give me another moment to realize another dream
He has not yet been alone and you are crying like a baby
I'm taking a flight already today
-----------
Can I ask you a question
See that you remember my heart and my soul on the day and the night.
I am happy to have a good night and have a good night
I will give you a little watery time and I will give my life to the water of my soul and my soul.
Overpriced and unprofessional
And when you will be called in the judgment of my God, do not you judge me as an angel?
-----------
They told me between the lines, eyes like a blue sea
It's in the opposite building
With two dogs and a cat.
Every night she runs down to the park
And how beautiful or not
The most beautiful in town.
-----------
I was crazy
I always said
Here everyone wants only to escape
The whole country is crazy here
There is no one who does not feel a champion
We made history
-----------
While you're under the covers
Deep inside my head, the vodka turns.
So there's nothing new on TV
Like a tray full of scraps
Pretty tired, I tried to tell you
But you're lost in dreams and I have plans.
-----------
A passing day does not come back
You will be happy and do not give up
And you touched me so much
I won and I have you
Tell me what else I'll ask
I got everything there was
-----------
Keep my loved ones to you my desire
O clouds of O Lord, O clouds, on a day of trouble, do not leave me
I will lift my eyes to the mountains from the soul.
You have read, please forgive even if I sinned.
I'm back on your way, I'll go until I can
You will have an eternity in you.
-----------
At dusk
And today I'm a street cat
Looking for a good cat
So if you see one
Passing around
Tell her there's a cat free for love
-----------
And the sky was blue
How good it was that I fell in love with you
You're amazing, all my life
The wind in my wings
I'm flying to you, to your hands
Diving into your eyes, oh ah ah, love
-----------

And it's worth a thousand words
I see you in the rush
Wanna dance with you a little dance
A little dance
Dance with all the soul .....

I will guard you with all my strength,
I'll keep you so do not go
I have sworn the whole world to submit to you
To be the sane place for you and me
Every morning you embrace and rejoice,
To know I have more strength to give you all of me
-----------
Everyone knows my eyes
you are my life
The power in me.
Everyone knows my eyes

You and I are a love alliance
God's portion, in a sealed week
This night has become one
Like two hearts beating with the same soul
And I see myself in your eyes laughing, crying, happy and calling you
Come hug me.
-----------
Who will give up herself just for me.
My fault, I hurt, maybe I got a bit carried away
I wanted to tell you:
Well, I did not mean to come back
Everything I said, forget it
Give me a reason to try.
