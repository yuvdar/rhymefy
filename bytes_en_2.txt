And for yourself you promise not to hurt
So get up and wake up
Go into the future
The day will come when you look back and say
How in the past I failed and made mistakes
Today I am in the way I dreamed of living
-----------
And everything unfolds before us
The distance is approaching touching from the heart
What a day it was that we had run away from here
And we made a lot of love
We felt a connection to eternity
And we discovered the secret of sacrifice
-----------
I sing to you, excited
For with the arrow of your gaze you will set fire to me
I carry all my prayers to your happiness
All my locks break into you
All my nights and I'll be by your side
In all my cords, release your song
-----------
You'll have a safe place here
We have a way to learn how
Be whatever you want
To step into the light and fly like a bird
And walk me through thousands of sounds
Learn from what is good to know love and beyond
-----------
I have the strength not to forget
Bring you back to me and always keep our love
In front of eyes and sky and the tranquility of a blue sea
Together we will have good in our love
How much I wanted to forget just to give up and forgive
But I can not without you, I'll leave everything
-----------
Trying to play the game me is crazy
Come on and realize that now I'm like a child in love
I always thought I could come up
And just get everything
But suddenly there are surprises and maybe it does not persist
Can not figure it out
-----------
Let yourself understand
Let it never happen again
Let the time come and you understand me
Then a tear will pass and again you will come to my lap
No pain, no reason to be alone
To stay in my arms, to fall in love
-----------
I have to come and take it now
What is left
Something comes and flows in me now
It gives me the power to be in love
I do not give up. I get up and fight
Be what you want in front of the whole world
-----------
Hiding my tears every night tell me how long
The fire that calls me is not really there
And the one who disappeared, will he return or is already dead?
along the sea...
Tell me how to stop the tears
Tell me how ...
-----------
Come on, let's get rid of the sadness
I hope that in your heart there will always be joy
In the end, everyone is always equal
Love and sounds
And in the embrace of the melody, a smile to the soul
be who you are
-----------
I know I'm here with you
And my luck opens
You will not be alone
I'm with you forever
Waiting for you to just look and give me another sign
Hugging you tight I'm ready
-----------
I want you to hug me
And you will love only as you know
Come and try and go back to the days
The most beautiful ones in my heart
Then we will know that there is hope for love
I always knew with you ...
-----------
To you I will give everything to you only with love
If you just give me the strength to try
And be yours
To you I will give everything to you only with love
If you just give me the strength to try
And be yours
-----------
Which will warm the heart
mother
Thank you for everything you gave me
Whatever I did, you believed
Me always on the path of a dead king
You always wanted me to be good
-----------
We'll go away from everyone
They say the most beautiful sunsets at the end of the world
Come on
I'll get a guitar
Look how she sings
Ne na na ne na ..
-----------
Then came August who melted the pain
Some girls made bonfires in our hearts
And in life as in life it just happens
All tourists come and then leave
But in my heart we must have stayed
The same thing win good guys
-----------
The whole world
And at night when you're not with me
How the heart did not fall asleep
The days I fought alone
You beat them all
With your peace
-----------
Gidi: And this is the way, hey, hey,
And who knows what his name is?
He'll shout his name now,
Anyone who wants to get ...
Be
Makes the Internet better, better
-----------
If she ran away depending on mood and spirit of the times
She'll do the jackpot
Where are all your girlfriends I want to see hands on
Tell me what will be the end with you no longer kneeling
Hoppe makes me hopa Say what you'll be What will be you girls
What is it going to tell me what it makes me Chicky Chicky blood blood like that all day long
-----------
Memories and disappointments
Which we wanted to release
We almost gave up on ourselves
We'll run away from routine
As when we were satisfied
In simple happiness
-----------
I did not stop looking for you, I did not stop the search
And why and why the light comes down here, it's dark
Do not repeat the same joke, they will not laugh at it
And why and why did you suddenly disappear in the middle of the word?
You did not say you were unhappy, so maybe I'm wrong again
You're wrong again
-----------
What do I have?
what happened to me
That's how it feels to fall in love
Who calls me?
Maybe she'll answer me
So the heart suddenly beats
-----------
I'll move mountains
For you until you see the sun at sunrise
Let's take a couple of days, me and Jerusalem
You might know I might pull out a ring
If I forget you, you know ..
Life has made me crazy about you. If you walk, you know I was
-----------
Just look into my eyes- I'll take you
Away to Paradise, you wanna feel alive
Well open up your eyes- I love you
And only words like I Love Yo should be
On your lips, beautiful beautiful
And free love spread in the street
-----------
I'll walk away quietly
They will not hear my voice again
Until I am sad
Until all my hair is white
They will not hear my voice
If you tell me no
-----------
And again a memory sinker sinks
That's all that's left
So day is a day and a few lies
When will I find a shady corner?
Dark Shadows sad songs
When will the door be opened?
-----------
A little more thinking about you
What we could have been
How another day was over
I'm still singing to you
Looking for solutions again
Looking for solutions
-----------
Time flies
Like airplanes in the sky
In the end everything passes
A lot of people I knew
Let them not come back
Let them not come back
-----------
So, let me come pick up the pace. Come on dance
I'm cute when she laughs
A bad boy from a good home has no peace
She has a thump and I have it
Come, come and get a hug
Come, come with a little pampering
-----------
My heart is almost out of his mind
Out of his mind
So do not be angry because it's just because of you
And building it never again will not work
You take a piece of my soul just for yourself
Just for yourself
-----------
Just do not ever go
I'll always be here with you
Do not mold, stay
I want only you
And maybe my whole life
I'll just be yours and maybe
-----------
It was time to move. I was tired of the groove
Maybe you'll get out of the rhythm
It's an old story I've long been prepared for
How you do not want to go
On the way, you open another window and you do not want to sleep today
On the way, music at the head lets let's go back to begging Yalla we arrived Yalla arrived
-----------
And fears so afraid
Oh God, just give me the power
That she would understand how much I loved
Maybe today I'll go out for a drink
To pay the lies I had forgotten
To pay the lies
-----------
Give him baby freedom only today
Mami pack a bag and go back to Mama
I can not burn my soul inside anymore
When will you understand?
What happened? You became a man
Okay my life
-----------
You're going to come back
Come to me and come to me
You know it's real now
Or so it seems
I love you now with me
Come to me and come to me
-----------
I want to devour the morning to find a place for me
Then I could breathe
The sun is a submarine
Although fog does not leave a scar it hurts
Want to devour the night
Then I could breathe
-----------
To see the light touch the heat in your eyes when I will return to you
You might tell me what you think
When will we have a toast?
We'll have another dream
Run into the imagination until you
I'll always follow you
-----------
And from one to ten I miss a million
Although you have not been mine for a long time
And lately
We talk only about politics and sex
This world is heavy, I do not understand
And where are you, where are you?
-----------
It did not happen with Nili
And not with her sister Sivan
We drove to Greece and lit a barbecue with a little smoke
I took out the guitar and sang an old song
If you remember me, Sivan
Oy oy oy if you remember me Sivan
-----------
By the end of my days I will give you everything and I will give you everything
After all the years with you
He could not sink anymore
I understood that you should also listen not only to hear
You are like a cool breeze comforting on a day of heat
I swear you forever love
-----------
Now I'm alone and again I'm on my side
Maybe you do not remember maybe a little differently
Now he is alone again and is again left on the side
All evening he dials the candles
Waiting maybe I'll hear a knock at the door
Everything I had cooked long ago had cooled but still playing the song
-----------
My eyes that comforted you dripping without stopping
I dream you to me
I dream you to me
The smells of rain rising from the curbstones
Reminds me of days of closeness smelling of love scents
There are beautiful than you sure but as beautiful as you are in the world I know this burning in my blood
-----------
The waves had already broken in the sea
Do not let your heart go again
The crescent rose to Moloch and you still sit
To the mirrors of distant lights your tears dried up
Your two eyes are calm in the air
Comfort
-----------
Perhaps he was too quick for both of us to whisper
Good for us separately
We were drunk with youthful love
We would fly in the wind
Now I walk barefoot among the pieces
Can not find a safe place
-----------
I feel bad
I miss you so much
Can not leave so I came close
Maybe this is the end or everything will pass until we have good
So, let's love the rest of the madriga. I see you in my ears.
I have not forgotten what lies in your heart
-----------
It 's all because of love
How everyone dances me and you make life
Cool smile I feel a little in the sky
So gentle he came to scream
You're so different
You are one of them all
-----------
What your heart screams inside
Do not please my beauty
Get up and go elsewhere
You are still upset
My skin is beautiful
The pomegranate gave a smell but not in my garden
-----------
I found a painting of a girl and recalled memories
Of simple dreams about the flight of a bird
And a thorn bush that left scars of simplicity
I found old shoes in the closet
And the ways I walked went up and down
The shoes are like the ways I went
-----------
I do not want to be alone
Yours forever will never go
I'll be by your side
The way you come to me again finds myself excited again. Like a child
And like an exposed child waiting for a caressing smile at me. You know
You know when or if you should understand everything
-----------
you know that I love you
Oy oy oy oy
Do not come enough of the nonsense anymore
Dee is tired of the heaviness and do not come
just kidding
you know that I love you
-----------
When you wear that trouser leg
Something's happening to me
And I'm sad it's like that
There is not only love here in the middle of the night
Once we liked to talk and find out a little more
from yesterday
-----------
I can not find myself until the end of the day
At the end of the day to you I come and throws the tie
It's hard for me to breathe anyway
At the end of the day I come to leave the party
That's how I drank the other day
At the end of the day, only you, your eyes, make me come back
-----------
I never forget you
I'm dazed
The weekend was over, all disgruntled
On the way to the country everyone is eating movies
But it's not terrible because there's something comforting
At the end of the month Ahadov's brother marries
-----------
We talked about a wedding I wanted but in Bat Yam
And you wanted Be'er Sheva
You wanted so much Be'er Sheva
So I went back and possessed a madness
A train takes a passenger south of Dimona
What are you doing to me? What are you doing to me?
-----------
"If you tell me to go, I'll go,
If you say no, I will not come back.
But nothing but one do not ask
Do not tell me to forget
Because you do not love my beloved
That's why I will not have the strength.
-----------
Brother - call me brother
I will always forgive you.
Returning home as one,
In the background Zohar is singing alone
Together we will not be alone.
forever.
-----------
Go my life my heart and my aunt
I will call to you, I will call you
I admit all my failures
My disappointments, my fears and obstacles
They are all in my favor
There is no other in my heart just for you I admit
-----------
Love you to the sky
And in love with you in your eyes
Fire inside me, I melt away from you
Give me a burning love
I have no one else
Fire inside me, I melt away from you
-----------
Just do not let go
Even when you pass and stare
How addicted I am to you do not understand
You're like a little girl and you're spinning
Tell me what you are going through until you come to me until you come to me
Until you come
-----------
You find the emotion in you and the fire
Opens my heart and gives everything there is
You illuminate the night and close the day
Only with you I'm sure I'll live the dream
You give the power to continue and not fall
Without you I have no peace but you have a place
-----------
Years waiting for you and again you disappear
Words:
Even if they laugh and say crazy I will not give up
Years have passed since the city has changed
You must be wrapping someone else's blankets
See you out of the last drop of rain
-----------
The beautiful period of peace and quiet
She passed but I still had hope
Wherever he goes he can not find anything exciting
Feels inside me a feeling of sadness burning
Walking around the street does not understand what everyone wants
And again he was alone with those moments
-----------
Sometimes it's better to stop
To see ahead, go ahead
Always remember that there are those who love and do not forget either
That there's a father upstairs who keeps, only you because you are
Man, what do you fall asleep in, wake up begging
Spilling conversation requires forgiveness, Lord of the Lords
-----------
I still have a love that does not want to sleep
So come to me today
Remember how we ran in the rain and we were not afraid to make a mistake
How many hours to do it costs me at night
And it burns my stomach already I have no answers
How many hours to do it costs me that night
-----------
Every market and courtyard and alley and garden,
Lousy walls every little stone -
Elect and Save as a souvenir.
And from city to city, from country to country
Anoda with a song and a music box
To your glamorous lowness.
-----------
And the pictures only remind the nights of the nights
So give me just a little sign now
If there's any chance we'll still be loved
After all, you left suddenly
The soul is hard to breathe
Maybe you'll be back today, today
-----------
She denied any access,
That's what happened when ...
I gave her my life
I went down on my knees
Believe me, everyone
I learned what it was and was insulted.
-----------
Yes, everything is possible, just say Amen
Artist, artist, artist
That everything I dreamed would come true, Amen
There is no end to my love, Amen, Amen
Tonight will play me a tune, neh
Play me a tune
-----------
You love
Breathe up close
You're part of me
Every day also thank you what is mine
Remember
You're part of me
-----------
And now what remains of us what
Wai Wai does not know what I'm doing
Wai Wai How many glasses do I drink
What about you with my head spinning
And only now did I realize that I was alone
Wow ...
-----------
Tell me everything that's sitting on your heart
And every tear on your face
She'll wash your words
Let me share the pain
I know it hurts
But in the end it will pass
-----------
An hour or so goes up north
Moran dials the telephone answering machine again
Sorry, unavailable
Two minutes at the destination continues the celebration
Sarah sang a happy song and they all flew
Every expansion is burning in the clouds
-----------
A hopeless romantic
Habibi Albi breathed
Says Bay to friends
We will meet only in the celebrations
Let 's get good news
Here in the neighborhood bar ...
-----------
Look what's going on with you
The good and the bad you choose
And time will understand that time passes
Where to go from here
He will always take from you
It has no limits
-----------
You gave a promise
Meet the family
You've always called me your life
Ignoring reality
Look a little serious
And maybe in the end I'll be your life
-----------
We have not spoken for so many years
Where are you today tell me what's going on with you
Who hugs you at night in the blankets
Where are you today I suddenly disappear
How I cried alone at night
At night
-----------
You always say to dream big
Talk like sand and there's nothing to eat
All against nature
The perfume spilled like rain on me
How he always puts a little too much
Let's live the moment
-----------
After all, it's only because of you that I exist
Big Daddy
Daddy is not a little girl anymore, I'm a lady
Just watch over me and keep me from falling
Just because of you, even when it's hard for me to be happy
Big Daddy
-----------
It does not take much to know that ...
This evening we came to pick up a party here
Everyone drinks and everyone dances
And there is no normal one
Then hug me and turn me around
Until we get sun
-----------
The guy was too sure of himself
If he did not wake up, it would be too late
She's in love, she's dreaming about
He would not find such a burning love anymore
She's in love, she's dreaming about
She is one and only - she and no other
-----------
God answered me, wiping my tears
Where is the man who will be here beside me?
Why my God, with all my prayers
Despite my pleas, I was left alone
God answered me, wiping my tears
Thirst for happiness hidden in the world
-----------
She is still praying
Even when the wind is playing
And your name is written, engraved on all the walls of my house
In the streets you're drunk I dance
You're running away I'm staying
Even if we have become memories
-----------
That you are there without me. You are there without me
No longer want to participate in the game again
Yours, he says brazenly
The sadness increases to the bones and slowly it again penetrates
Gd what a feeling
Night is not broken ...
-----------
No need to hide or escape
He gives me the strength
And there's a friend who's just mine
He loves me like I am
I live quietly with him
Do not let me go
-----------
You suddenly come to me
And again it seemed like a dream to me
On nights nights imagines you coming back
And in the cold and blankets he embraces me and I say
Do not worry, I'm here forever
Waking up to that empty bed
-----------
What was written in front of my eyes
How stupid / I looked for proof
To see with my own eyes / to be safe
Through the smoke / and all the mess
You kissed her / I saw you!
You were with her!
-----------
So many words
Let me get up this morning
All my dreams about you
How I found myself here without you
Drowning in lies
Let me wake up in the room with you
-----------
How we are not together
I do not have air
A taxi to the city
I've got a last flight
How we lost hope
There is no love anymore, no love
-----------
His head would be blessed with great blessings
And travel at any time as a river of peace
Biava Brina carries beacons
He will receive and see the salvation of the Lord
My son-in-law will be happy with my faith
It will be a blessing from God
-----------
You do not deserve a man like him
So how can you tolerate him?
Even after everything that happened happened
You still say it's not so bad
What kind of husband did you find my wife?
How can you stand me?
-----------
But he did not hear a word from the medic.
My brother, my brother! The wounded man whimpered.
Across the river the Cattails,
My brother, my brother
My brother, my brother
My brother !!!
-----------
This is a way of life
And in the difficult moments
She will always smile and show everyone
It does not break
Blessed be the Lord'
Everything is for the best, she says
-----------
I will die die die die for you ..
I will love you till i die
I will die die die die for you ..
I will die die die die for you ..
I will die die die die for you ..
I will love you till i die
-----------
Honey, you're lucky
I'm making movies for you
And I have good taste in jewels
If you dragged me
This is true law
There is no one like me
-----------
Libby Libby in his memoirs on Shabbat
And on the most beautiful days, there was only longing
Thank God day and night
That I am a daughter of Israel
Daughter of the king of kings
The child of Gd
-----------
We have great joy
The rest is unimportant
Chicken Chicken Frenzy
Let the soul fly
We have great joy
The rest is unimportant
-----------
I will bring the rays of sunrise into our lives
In the flowering colors I am the finger of love
Sweet violins will still be played here for us
In a gold palace I will love you
Just give me your heart
Just give me some of you
-----------
You see another place
One that has a little more
Maybe you'll see me as simple as I am
You see, I'm not like everyone else
And for me everything is perfect
Everything is greener in the grass in my garden
-----------
Inta Daiman Omri
I'm not alone
Inta Daiman Omri
Inta Daiman Omri
Inta Daiman Omri
I'm not alone
-----------
Which was not in vain
It was never in vain
In one moment she'll hug me tight
Let's not quarrel anymore because of anyone
That I would not be afraid to be alone
And in a moment I will not worry
-----------
You look and ask what about you
If something bothers something oppressive
Something is bothering you
She comfortes you, she tells you
Do not worry, Yvni, everything is for the best
You are not my darling Daley you are my life ....
-----------
And why her hand in his hand again is her name
And at night the pain is burning in my heart
A sea of ​​tears because of him was already pouring down
My prayers did not help me again
You will tell him that my heart only loves
After him blindly walks ...
-----------
Half of you half of me one big whole
We were happy two in that garden
Fantastic trees which always bloomed
I miss you for the sweet days ...
There is no one like you among all the halves
We were together
-----------
Night by night he comes to me at night
He wakes me up in the dark with all the freaks
Night Night Mother Why?
You want to throw away all the memories
He came to me at night and he came to me at night
He came to me at night and he came to me at night
-----------
I wanted to feel the taste
Those lips that once kissed me
I thought we would be the same
When you promised me a world
- How did you tell me?
You'll still be my wife
-----------
We'll be happy and dance too
Brooke Brock
Love spills
Time stops
The night is still young
Brooke Brock
-----------
They're broke with money
But there is love there
Neh Neh Neh Neh Neh
They're broke with money
But there is love there
Neh Neh Neh Neh Neh
-----------
And I had no good reason
Forget for now
I shouted to you to come back to me
You were in heaven
All the best reasons in the world
That I will break the rest of my days
-----------
Every day I waited for him to come to me
Now he flies to Miami
One-way card
How much I called him from my mother
He left me alone
And I gave him all of me.
-----------
This sanctity has accompanied us for thousands of years
I want to approach you with all my might
I want to connect with you with all my heart
God please illuminate the upper length within me
Alokhi Zachani Please feel the length
In my soul in my soul
-----------
The days will pass
And again I will sing my poems
As if he were a river to a flowing sea
Like a shadow she will follow me
Brother, how long, my God, will I be alone
Brother, my God, how long will I be alone
-----------
And say: "Come and peel it away from me now,
Like peeling an egg. "
And take the time, we will not meet anyone,
And then say that time is vanquished,
And we'll hear television from afar, and by the way,
The world could live without us now.
-----------
And what I had before you was a dreamer and only you
Thank God for having you how life got on
Like a mad lover how to run away from me words
Just want to sing hard and also dance the mountains
That you are my only one with you I have completed everything
A combination of beauty and wisdom and a heart so great
-----------
But from a distance maybe a cloud is coming
Take a ride with you to my knees
Half cup is full and you will always remember
And when the sun goes down to the sea
Do not worry tomorrow she shines again!
Hold on to my little leaf ....
-----------
I'm dreaming you're all gonna hear me
I will shout in a voice that loves you if you are mine
I found love with you. I found peace
Do not leave me in love with you anymore
Only with you until the end of Jamie will I kiss you without enough
If only you will understand if you believe me again.
