We both are so silent every night and say nothing
Because everything between us has already been said and certainly is permissible
Slowly trying to look for a touch of the hand and feel alone
How long will we keep your eyes always asking?
That in your heart you are again afraid of that future
We both remember the happy past and know it's all over
-----------
You can not give up even when you're with another people
Do you still remember?
Those nights you felt otherwise
Me and you as one body
And the fire inside me remained forever
Waves ...
-----------
Get out of it now but miss
The heart may kick because he always knows
Slowly comes out of it slowly
I gave quite a bit everything open
Get out of it now but miss
The heart may kick because he always knows
-----------
You are still in yours, my beloved
The days were gone, how people asked
What with them what they do we were a pair of pigeons
And at night I think I'm hurting I'm writing
What will end how much I love
You do not answer me anymore
-----------
A week with her and you'll be crazy
And a storm broke out in the heart of the city
Now the night just mentions her
But I know her
In wars between us I surrender, she wins
In love with her I swear, I take a breath
-----------
Oh father
The longing that remains
Oh father
Your voice is gone
I remember you laughing
You're so heartless
-----------
Again you are silent, from me closing your heart
Not embracing, not telling who took your smile
I almost gave up almost succeeded
Tonight I broke down, barely breathing I did not fall asleep because of you
And I only asked you to find the strength in your heart
I almost gave up almost succeeded
-----------
That I would not be exposed to lies
The words injure me
Between obstacles and emotions
The sun will shine on us
The tears will stop
Stay a moment longer ..
-----------
Go away and then I'll turn over in my bed
Promise me that you will stay forever
I always knew that it was you who completed
And when I was wounded, you cured my soul
The sky, the air, the earth
The dream, and the sounds of the melody
-----------
Because you have everything I was looking for and who needs more
With you I have always dreamed about staying
When you appeared after years of silence
I almost forgot how beautiful you are
When you touched the light I touched the soul
And to you I said, you've developed a door for me
-----------
He looks at her approaching, and falls again
Do not trust her, do not wait for her.
Many had already fallen, they had not asked
She trusted her in vain
Without explaining, that they would never succeed
Only a few understood alone
-----------
Why did you come back like a stormy sea in your heart?
Like the waves I drift away and love again
From the light of your eyes, my whole body trembles
Mountains of emotions from which I am afraid
You play on strings of love
Every string touched my soul
-----------
When she is here but in her eyes, she sees the end
A burning fire, all the time in her eyes
She creates, the secrets in her heart
Just accumulating, not saying, what I was for her
And I'm afraid, alone I will not run
And I fall apart, just want to hug
-----------
She is as beautiful as a dream, but why is she like that
There was no place left for me, a new love
Perhaps you will say what is in it, that there is no other
And tell her why she does not have feelings
Maybe you'll tell me how, she's so beautiful
Just tell me, and tell her too
-----------
Dreams or nightmares I did not fall asleep for many nights
There are tears There are no smiles There is no feeling inside me
The tears are tears of blood and the cry of a human heart
I will not continue until you come back
The tears are tears of blood and the cry of a human heart
I cry out when you'll be back
-----------
I need you so hard,
Immersed in memories torn from pain,
My nights without you turned black,
Cold Tears Words that hurt the soul,
That I understood that I was wrong, you were not close,
The tears and the words ...
-----------
Goes back and it's beep beep beep as if she's parked
And why does her look ... do with me and her ass asshole in the picture is all the picture will be built #Dobigl !!
C'mon C'mon
C'mon C'mon
C'mon C'mon
Come on, come on ... No, no, no, no, no.
-----------
But love grows even when you dig
In red you do not stop maybe you do not like
Leaving back like a plot in a movie, let's walk forward
Or go back to Mother
She shouts the dishes, breaks, you're not an actress at Habima
Or go back to Mother
-----------
At night I leave alone
In my dreams you always appear
with your
Sometimes I feel another person
I'm willing to give up
About everything because you're worth a little more
-----------
The stars from above had stopped smiling
And I'm looking for your way again
Just look at how much I lack the steepness of my own
I forgot the way to you long ago
Just give me a sign I'll reach your heart with love and soothe
And that's a sign that we're together again
-----------
When God composed our sons
It's such a great gift
To win all the good in the world
Be your son
A man with such a great heart
I'll always be yours
-----------
I have no way to explain
Tell me why
I'm addicted to kisses for hugs and tears
Which pour out of your brown eyes
Just give me a minute to say I'm with you in everything
In both good and bad I remain
-----------
But when we both love our hearts united
And pray that it will not end
I want to yell at you my beloved
That you feel so happy
If you let me tell you my soul
I'll cross the world for you
-----------
Let me explain why
Tell you how many, how beautiful you are
My heart will not give up on you
My heart wants to be with you
My heart will follow you
My heart wants to be yours
-----------
I do not know where I fell from
Lucky to hold your hand
Now I'm part of you
I love falling in love with you
I just wanted to tell you ...
This is a roller coaster .....
-----------
My heart starts to ache
Just want to love her
What I have already lost
Only past, present, future
I can not live without her anymore
Ole Ole Ola ...
-----------
If I were the only one to fall in your way
If only I could make you smile
Yes, only I gave you the moon
From the sky he returned to you flying
I'm in a dream you take
To the legends we shall spread a wing
-----------
Total wants to rejoice
You're not convincing
It drives me crazy
But you know, too
What else needs to happen, then
Take my heart and do not let me wait until you get used to me Only together Have a special power Take my heart and do not let me wait You get used to me Because always the two are good One take me
-----------
You find everything in you
Nothing is a lack of me
The power that holds me
I'll give you everything
Nothing will happen to me
you are my Love
-----------
Playing almost without feeling, I know with you is a bad business
Stop deluding me or just being my love
Oh ... how beautiful you are, but you do not understand what you're doing to me
What are you doing unintentionally?
Oh, how beautiful you are, but you do not understand what you're doing to me
What are you doing to the soul?
-----------
Whose name is waiting and loving
At first light I'm on the train
Weekend Everything is calm
I and you go where else is unknown
What we are sure is alone
Let's love every Saturday
-----------
Love extends a hand
Hug me with all my might
Only once
Yaffa, come to me
Give me a kiss on my lips
Yupiofa Let's fly tonight to the sky
-----------
