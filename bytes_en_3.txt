And the tears cried, I have no more words in my heart.
From the sky may you return to my house, listen.
And my eyes are not quiet, I miss her lover, and silence envelops the days in the storm, from the sky water may return to my home, forgive me.
Forgive me Excuse me Do not rush to get rid of my feelings, forgive me forgive me I did not want to lose you, I did not have time to hug you, all day the heart wants you.
I was saved from the fears and there was nothing to worry about, and I corrected my heart for everything. There was a reason, from the sky maybe water would return to my lap for a party.
Forgive me Excuse me Do not rush to get rid of my feelings, forgive me Excuse me I did not want to lose you, I did not get to hug you, all day All day long The whole heart wants you.
-----------
I got up and went to live in the mountains to look for the secret spring
For months I searched for my question in the villages, but I could not find any secret fountain
A girl I knew was a shepherd girl and I fell in love there in the mountains
And only then did I realize that it was so bright
Whoever loves him has a young world in him
Whoever loves him has a young world in him
-----------
Only you will happen to me ...
When you cry, I sing until morning
To your laughter, I am filled with happiness again
You are a photographer for me
I'm yours until the day I die
Know you reserved my love
-----------
Look at me sitting like a madman
I had not left the room for two days
Look at me dreaming of love
I do not sleep and smoke alone in the room
See if you can still love me
If only for a day, if only for an hour, if only for a minute
-----------
How to keep me from stumbling
Mother the happiness at home
The power for me
You give me your soul
I always have to think, pray for my safety
Because my mother will happen to me
-----------
And onward toward the East
Looking towards Zion.
Our hopes have not yet been lost
The hope is two thousand years old
To be a free people in our country
The land of Zion and Jerusalem
-----------
Asking you I am thirsty for love
Let her back to me
Back into my life
Sad and empty all my life
From the day she left and she is gone
He asks me to at least see him
-----------
And if sometimes the sky is dark
And sometimes there is a hearty cry
And I can not bear the injustice
My assistants carry the heads
My assistants carry the heads
My assistants carry the heads
-----------
So beautiful are you my wife
A love song for you
Good wind tell you
At the end and the rains
Only you love
Until the end of time
-----------
Let us return to love and see the good
That I could hug you every night
It's me, it's me
I've been waiting for years
It's me in the winds of the rains
Do not break and fight back
-----------
Feel you deep in my bones
Until you after days in exile
To the wall that is bleeding with the pain of years ...
I came from the crowd and whispered in awe
Hear O Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is One!!
I came to you ...
-----------
Your memory embraces me and embraces me suffocating
Winds blow in intensity
God cries out
That she would return to have the pain
In front of cold winds blowing I stand
God is crying I repent I regret
-----------
He keeps running away from me
Every time I remember you
And you're already with another
You found another love
It's true that my heart is burning
But I'm glad you're happy
-----------
I'm coming to you
To give you love
So let's have eyes
We will fly to the sky
I'm coming to you
To give you love
-----------
Three sons and one daughter
With you to raise a family in two
It is a great and powerful happiness
I fly I fly to heaven from you
I fly all trembling and excited
I'm weak I'm weak When you're not beside me ... my love ...
-----------
Against your dizzying beauty
Anyone can fall
For me everything
Without you you can not
Against your dizzying beauty
Anyone can fall
-----------
Chizri
When I met you I knew that was my fate
And I will not forget you, my love
Even if a gap has opened between us
The heart wants you
We want everything again
-----------
And you're on me all year long
The spirit of the Divine Presence
Say that you have a love for life
My books are thinking of me for nights and days
Words like that are a tune to my ears
Playing on the strings of my heart, this is the music of my life
-----------
We loved as children at the moment you decided to go
And since life is a little different and there is no one to love
I kept writing you songs I dreamed you were playing
Guitar Sunset and Seagulls An old boat moves away
To the great sea disappears Who knows when you will return ...
Oh my love .....
-----------
Night and he is with her
Who named her a thief
It's cold inside my heart
I once wrote to her
Letters of lovers
Today they are sad
-----------
You are the only one
He keeps the Children of Israel always as one
Purify my heart for your servant truly
I gather all my strength to give
Our haters and all those who seek our repentance will die
For there is no other but him and no one else
-----------
Reinforce all evil
My little boy
Do not be fooled by that father
In any case she sees
Take care of yourself
And connect to the goodness in your heart
-----------
Crashing Crashing in waves
If you still love
You're crying or hurt
If you still love
You're crying or hurt
Come back ...
-----------
Pretty Dee
Not trying to forget you
Pretty Dee
How much can you fool me
Pretty Dee
Whatever it is you and me forever ..
-----------
I asked for the rain to drizzle gently on the window,
I asked the night to come slowly,
Like the night you brought into the world.
I washed, combed, and put on new clothes for you,
In your room I put a new painting, and for the first time, a picture of Simcha.
I waited to wish you ...
-----------
Without you I have no light, pity me
You ruined my house, what did you do to me?
You stole my chicks, where's a precious son?
What's left of me in the world? There is nothing to live on
How I remained orphaned, how I feel like crying
It breaks a man's heart...
-----------
That's my luck
Night you're by my side
Morning envelops you with me
You are mature and understanding
How much love is there
How is it that the heart does not lie?
-----------
Give me a second chance to ask you for forgiveness

I was wrong in the way I chose
I was wrong in what I did
I was wrong that I did not
About the nest of love
-----------
Oh my beautiful kiss me
I'll give you anything you want
He was alive
I'll give you anything you want
He was alive
By morning you'll dance
-----------
What else needs to be done to make me respond?
What else should you do to get me back
If only you could remember what I did for you
If only you knew what I went through because of you
If you were not going everything would be different
If only you would repeat everything I would give
-----------
I will not leave you until I find you
Paints you and is so beautiful
And the pain squeezes the tears
He looks at you and is silent and wants only to kiss
Again your soft lips
let me Love You...
-----------
Whoever loves him has a young world in him
Whoever loves him has a young world in him
And when I grew up with the passage of time my children told me about the spring
How an old man told me that in the mountains between basalt rocks and a secret fountain
How I found happiness there, there among the mountains
I got up and went to live in the mountains ...
-----------
Does not give me a chance to ask you for forgiveness
I will not forget your look
I miss you
Live and breathe only you
Every second every minute
The back wheel can not be answered ...
-----------
A psalm for the Sabbath day
It is good to thank God, and to sing to your highest name
To say in the morning your kindness and your faith at night
Ali Asor and Ali Naval, Ali Logon on the violin
For God's mercies are in your actions, in the actions of your hands, Arnan
Oh my Gd ...
-----------
Only with you I have survived and will walk
Because we are two and one heart
Inside I felt a good love
And I wanted you to be close to me
You give my heart a great soul
only with you...
-----------
Three sons and one daughter
With you to raise a family in two
It is a great and powerful happiness
I fly I fly to heaven from you
I fly all trembling and excited
I'm strong I'm strong You're here next to me ... my love ...
-----------
Do not close your heart ...
You have the quality of warmth and understanding
There is no title I can give you
You have the attribute from the soul
Give me what you do not have
Do not close your heart ...
-----------
Today I alone do not know myself
I had everything I lost everything
I sank into drugs and great pain
On a spring day of a cold sun in my soul
My heart froze and felt my love
In my heart I froze
-----------
You think about him,
And a cat in the grass, running tail ...
To come to you suddenly,
Keep quiet, caress,
He has strange ways,
To tell you he loves.
-----------
Just waiting for you in love
There are no words to describe
Suddenly I said quickly
Oh, this is my heart breaking
Suddenly I said quickly
It's my heart breaking
-----------
You came to him and you are all excited,
And so suddenly he got up and left,
Do not cry and why do you break,
Soon luck will pass,
You'll just be all glamorous,
And so to be happy with man.
-----------
We will give everyone the best regards
Flying to a honeymoon
Even during the most difficult periods
Your name shouts in the streets
You're running through my veins
With you ever since, ever since and forever ...
-----------
And if it's upside down I can not sleep
The bed is empty for even two days
It's true that screwed up all this situation
Your'e not answering
Your heart is waiting
Your heart is waiting
-----------
I wanted to tell you
I'll Never Leave you my love
If you have not understood my whole life
You are my God, my soul
Albi Nur Hiyati
All the good in my eyes ...
-----------
And you're lucky she's only devastated by you
Conquer you like Rotem Sela
Looks like one of Sports Illustrated
Without stunning beautiful Photoshop
Made in Israel Natural Asalic
So come on you'll bring a hit ...
-----------
So believe me I know
Only you learn about life
So the world stopped when you said you were going
Not talking about truth, in silence always hurt lies
The movie did not end but she got up and left
Apparently love is not her genre
-----------
You came and introduced me to the sun
We talked a little, we loved a lot
Only love speaks
I have a few words to tell you
I just love you ...
to tell you...
-----------
At night in bed I whispered:
"You can already accept me,
Of all the questions I have weakened. "
Just the heart pounded and the ground trembled,
A little strange that you did not stay.
A little strange that you did not stay.
-----------
For me, a word is not just a memory
It is sometimes more like an arrow in the heart
And I hope we meet suddenly
Knowing if this is you or just a habit
Sleep alone or with the others
It seems abnormal to me.
-----------
Because of you my heart is shouting boom
Without you, he is not worth anything
If you're not with me then I have no tomorrow
And your friends tell me Do not Worry
Then strainers send me I'm sorry
She does what is in her head and she has no control.
-----------
Because nothing will help
Elevators, rising and falling
It's like your heart, it's like my heart
And tears like elevators
It's not that I am
It's on my heart
-----------
Our son never ends
So do not leave me
What's left ?! Nothing is left!
Take everything away from me
What remains of the past
Your picture and heart is broken
-----------
I like this
Whose Leo I am Libra and meanwhile
It is not simple to be with you on the edge
It's like a bullet in my chest
I hate that I'm still
Wild about you
-----------
You are really very beautiful today ...
Just because I feel like telling you
How beautiful you are today ...
It's not just the eyes
It's something from heaven
That I have you ...
-----------
What a pleasure to live
I will have no other
For me it is a world
And everything here is perfect
I will not walk without her
I love her.
-----------
Be with me
Playing guitar when I sing you a song
When I look at the sky, or just stare at the wall - be with me ..
When I'm alone at night looking for you
When it's not easy for me then it's probably not easy for you either,
Be with me .. Be with me .. Be with me Please be mine
-----------
It's like a major part of a drama
With an unconditional lover
Because there are no rules according to the book
We want you and that 's okay
Retrieve until you agree
Until I get you
-----------
Because she has something in her eyes
It's a gift from heaven
If she wants you then there is no choice
Because there was no way she would refuse her
She knows how much power she has
That throws you down without thinking a second
-----------
I pray to God
I hear
Maybe you're next to me
Or maybe far away
In the end I'll find you
Even if it took more time
-----------
You did not tell me and you did not tell me yes
It makes me crazy, you do not care
Easily, you know how to break
The heart that dreams only of you
You make my names easy
And I can not without you
-----------
I have the power to conquer the world
Everything revolves around you No one exists
You're the only one in my heart
I've been waiting for you for a lifetime
Let me shout to hear
who loves you
-----------
But for the time being you have not come
And I do not get it yet
How did you give me up suddenly?
I left you somewhere else
And I'm waiting for you here
With the same chorus chorus
-----------
And here it is
Our relationship to where
In a painful moment my heart breaks
She has someone else
Your friends know who I am
I will be ...
-----------
He dreams of you
All the walls with your pictures in the whole house
Balloons at the end explode
Or fly into the sky
You're wandering like the birds
I was already resting on the water
-----------
does not answer me
I wanted us to take a weekend in Dan Eilat
And you wanted a Friday at home
You do not work in pose is not you
You tell me you 're gonna save ... home
Paris or Aroma
-----------
Do not look down and quite a bit the wheel turns
It is not always true to swim in streams of hope
It is not always right to pursue love without pride
When the tears run down they also clean the stains of your heart
Not keeping inside is not unpleasant
It eats all of you
-----------
miss
Just come and caress my heart
From what I understood is another story
She has someone he helps her overcome
And how it did not hurt her
I'm here to hear about her
-----------
And if you go, do not forget me
We have together
More dream plans to fulfill
Here I will wait ... You also have a night and a day ...
Today..
Fly with you
-----------
Today if I meet you suddenly
Will we be like two strangers?
You do not ask if I've found love
Or how I went on living
I could not believe your one look
Stronger than a fountain of longing
-----------
You've captured my heart with a look
Yes it is Yes it is you
That in all ways and in all difficulties
At the end of my appearance
And I knew I'd be easy
I will win every army in the world
-----------
Suddenly there's light when you're home
Even the flowers here have already returned to me to smile
You came and swept my whole life
Everyone voted in a sea of ​​happiness
The reason I get up and get excited
With you is true love
-----------
Nor is there a man who died at the end of her love
It's true that it pinches
That thought
You're with him tonight
And he buys
You only sell love
-----------
But what to do
I like that
I'm not the one complaining
On the neighbor's lawn
All day long only conversations and conversations
It's all nonsense I like
-----------
And even if that's not so bad
Live another happy moment
In the background is Zohar Sher
About Eleanor and Alone, but we are not alone
About Eleanor and Alone
But, dude, we are not alone
-----------
He hears beautiful melodies and chants
Which cause the emotion to regenerate
There is something pure happening to the soul
Once again get excited to get lights
Forces of the road
And how the soul is happy now when she enters ..
-----------
Let's take a boat and a bathing suit
We'll sail beyond the horizon
Throwed in the sand with alcohol
In my life I had a pulse
Yes I want and want to
To dream in Spanish
-----------
Just ask you a question
If you are with him from love
So who invented the pain
For years he lived in my heart
From thoughts if you were
You stay here and for all
-----------
Let one of us come and stop crying

And take what I have
Even if it is little
I remember how you wanted more
How did you ask me?
-----------
She captures me with her charms
Can not do without it
Melting my heart
I'll always follow you. Wait
He can not do without you anymore
Do not go, do not go
-----------
Feel the rhythm
Leave the sadness
That night
We will not forget life
And the heart ... knocks again
And the heart ... knocks again
-----------
Where am I going?
And the pain like a wave hits me
He visits me while you're away
Looks like this time
To return again no longer tasted
Sad and nothing to do
-----------
Love is lost, it is like a sharp sword
That does not let you forget
I'm going away from you, I will not stand in your way again
Far from me, be his, be his, be his
I'll take my eyes to the horizon, alone
I'll take with me to forget, all the time in the world
-----------
With all my loving eyes I would be dazzled
I waited so long for you
And a turnstile turns at its own pace
That winter the heart broke ...
That winter was the wetest I remember
And everything that was between us went ...
-----------
You knew that for you my heart was open
Even if I chose to leave
I continued to love you
Without the smile
Without the look
Far but far away
-----------
Shout you like a drunk
Just go back
Just come back after you
After you I may never understand
After you, it's too hard to keep believing
That maybe ...
-----------
That I have left of you / that I have left in my heart
I have not slept for whole nights
I was afraid you were a different people
While the heart of you remember that you
Everything I dreamed
And without you is so lacking ...
-----------
That an open miracle would only help here
Maybe enough of her enough
But years I believed
For in my heart I knew
In the end I'll take you
Girl to the end of the world
-----------
We already knew that there was no choice
Time will heal our wounds
And I did not tell you ...
Remember that you've been more than my life
When you left you did not know then maybe
That you were really important to me
-----------
Then I'll tell you here between us
Im on top of the world
There is a God, there is a God
Come tonight, come tonight
If we believe, everything is possible for both of us
Tonight, tonight
-----------
Wakes up preparing me a miracle is witnessing sleep
Rolling half a cigarette before work
He came over to bed with a kiss
Without understanding how it had happened, I lay beside her
It's a rainy rainy day and we're both under the down
Says Mami with a smile
-----------
This fire is burning
You're fine all my life
How long can I go? How long will I break?
That in my heart the fall and the fear does not pass
You were all I had without laws
And now I am alone and we are far away ...
-----------
Afraid that this dream does not want to wake up suddenly
Understand that the light of imagination is over
Hold on to both hands, asking you to be in my life
The Creator sees us as angels dancing for us
You are mine I want you and only you forever,
In my heart that you are you and you are my life.
-----------
On cold nights he remembers her and cries
I want so much to know if I'm the one who's wrong
Luck has become a guest from today when you are not here
I'm torn when I'm not at his side
Now the wind does not cling to your birth either
Mami Do not wait for me I'm the one who walks
-----------
God will face you
May the Lord bless you and preserve you
May God bless His face and bless you
God will bear His face to you
God will bear His face to you
And he will appoint you, and will make peace for you
-----------
Go if you do not come back
Hope me breaks
Go if you do not hear
I'm already out of my mind
But if you let me pause
I can not live a minute ....
-----------
I will give you everything to return to my life
I will give you my heart for the rest of my life
Can not handle my mother Do not go
Just wait for me
I love but it hurts
Things did not get along the way I wanted
-----------
What did you do to me?
You have to wake up
You've found comfort in a place to hide
Tell me why you gave him faith
What I lacked
I gave you everything that was and now only a question remains
-----------
The party publicist makes me riot
Both Clara and Felka now I'm on stage
Send her another rose I finally her
In the wild we met again and ran to the cat in the alley
Singer Rising singer descending
Her entire body shakes
-----------
Waiting, at night, in the same place
You'd love to wait for you
Hours to open me up
Open your heart and do not close
Remember that you said love
Do not ruin everything that was
-----------
What are you doing and with whom?
A second ago you were mine
It's not just another sad song
This is my reality
Maybe already enough? Why do not you just come back?
Miss you that it really misses me ...
-----------
I'm so confused, not here or there
Let's go out and see the world
It's not fair, I was different, before you came
When you hurt my heart, what exactly did you think?
You choose, disappear at once
If you go, then go as you came!
-----------
Love really will never know ...
Love ... as I loved you!
With all the sorrow and all the pain
Turns out you're going
You taught me that I deserve it
Much better than you!
-----------
A man's tear is worth gold and I cried in love
My heart always dreams, that your heart returns to it.
If you opened your eyes a little
Looking a little beyond your tears
You would see an entire world, filled with the thirst of the heart
And only one man, whom you just love.
-----------
If you run away I'll never forgive,
Because this is what drives you crazy, and makes me hallucinations,
All the friends told me, because of you the problems,
You always appear like fairy tales,
And I do with you doing nonsense,
And I'm with you doing nonsense.
-----------
The melody of love.
Someone whispers to me the song of spring,
He hums softly and his voice is friendly
And the heart hears how the song rises,
Out of me comes like a rising river.
Something is happening to me, something is stirring ...
-----------
The sun and the sea
Bread, the world
Bitter and sweet
And all that was left
And all that was left
Live in the song
-----------
My heart to take
So you went
So you forgot
My heart to take
So you forgot
So you went
-----------
There she was
How sweet
There is no one who does not want to embrace her
How can I tell her from the heart?
Which I love
For fear that no one here would take her
-----------
where to go
I swear my life to you
where to go
I love you so much
where to go
I swear my life to you
-----------
Return again. Return to the sea
Return again
Go back there
Go back to the sea
Go back there again
Return to the sea
-----------
It's time you said where
You are now, give a little sign
How far will I go to see you?
All my life I will continue to want to belong
You left and left a lot of memories
When you went, you ruined all my dreams
-----------
Blessed is the man who trusts Hashem
And the name became his trust
Blessed is the man who trusts Hashem
And the name became his trust
Blessed is the man who trusts Hashem
And the name became his trust
-----------
Inside you, you will give me my house built on Mount Moriah
Go back to your quarters, return, and I will return
And I will redeemed your captives, and will become thousands of thousands
I will live on your land and become a fertile vine
Ronny Tzahali is a beautiful daughter
Inside you, you will give me my house built on Mount Moriah
-----------
And you knew what it was
What is forbidden and what is permitted
What is bad and what is straight
I know from your eyes nothing has disappeared
I know from your eyes nothing has disappeared
Because you knew ...
-----------
Messiah Messiah Messiah
Messiah Messiah Messiah
And the Holy One, Blessed be He, saves us from saving them
And the Holy One, Blessed be He, saves us from saving them
The whole world is a very narrow bridge
The whole world is a very narrow bridge
-----------
Begging God that it will not end
I just want you not to lie to me
And all the time only you in my thoughts
The sun and light in my world
Hold me tight my soul
Ahh the parting, ahh the parting
-----------
So give us keyboards.
Tonight night, great joy tonight
Tonight night, great joy tonight
We will not stop the celebration until the morning comes
Great party tonight, so let's go wild
Great party tonight, so let's go wild
-----------
Who worked hard
Without seeing the end of the road
And now we are passing
We did not rest and did not rest
They will not continue without us
This is the adventure of our lives.
-----------
Not a mirage, not a dream
You are the maiden and that is your voice
A spectacular gold bell,
Your heart is a diamond
The most beautiful girl in town
Go down your hair like a mountain of Mt. Hermon.
-----------
Your fate has already been sealed
The city is so big
And a lost name
Please return before you later
You know the Tree of Knowledge is not allowed
Snake in human skin is so left.
-----------
All my life, my life
Again they come back to me
From a journey in a distant way
I live, live, live
And the sun above me
It will shine on a long road.
-----------
And to my life I do not know your caresses anymore.
The days are passing by
And there are tears in your eyes
And I have not forgotten
The taste and smell
And the heart screams: "Come home"
