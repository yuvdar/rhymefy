A night wind blows, caressing the hair
And I come to you like a sea god
Addicted and sinking into your beauty
Embracing the moment, happy in man
Yes, here and now there is a man in love
Shouting only your world
-----------
Just take a look
You do not need anything anymore when you're there
Be careful, everyone says
Let the fanatics go
I do not care about that special thing
Rare, perfect ...
-----------
Come back to me tonight
I'm tired of painting
And imagine your face here
Smiling and forgiving my stupidity
Waiting for caress to explain
I will not hide your feelings from you again
-----------
I drove the direction of the sea
I took a beach direction
I caught the direction of my life, summer did me good
I drove the direction of the sea
I took a beach direction
I caught the direction of my life, good summer did me good
-----------
Floral bouquets
And wait for someone to come.
Ho those days
Ho those nights
Ho clear and wise
till sunshine rise
-----------
Like little balloons
Small balloons
Red balloons
Of Shiri and mine
Of Shiri and mine
Of Shiri and mine ...
-----------
Which was a blessing that differentiates
With the departure of three stars
My grandfather
It was mine
My grandfather
It was mine
-----------
I'm dying to tell you, I'm dying to tell you,
Dying to do the same with you,
There is still little hope in happiness that froze,
In the hidden room, now everything is allowed.
I wish I had a perfect love song here,
You'll take anywhere with you.
-----------
"You've been talking too much," she says, "so shut up
And give some quiet "...
Want to Florida ...
So that's it, you want Florida!
Now you know everything,
You can start dancing ...
-----------
Thank you for giving me courage, to live as if tomorrow.
And soon I'll whisper to you, and soon spring will come
I wish we had another good day, that our lives here would be thrown away
Tears are falling on the universe, meanwhile
My heart wants a bullet, for now
And once again adopted courage when nothing was like anything.
-----------
And after a night she loved you
When I feel empty already
Stay with me to dream together in small
I have a blue dream and I have a sky in it
Not giving up my dream yet
Do not give up my dream ... still ..
-----------
And I fall into the trap and think something like this:
You've probably found your love for a long time.
It was the summer of 70 ...
And when the violins cry with a sweet sound,
I remember you as if you were still here
So I talked to that guy and I talked to that guy ...
-----------
And even if we take pains against sadness and solitude,
It will not pass us that pain.
Just do not go if you're going to go ...
No, no, no, no, I will not give up on you
No, no, no, no, I will not give up on you
Sometimes it is sometimes too hard ...
-----------
You hang on my back again,
Because what you see now is unpleasant.
In the heart of the city where I was born,
After years I pass,
Near the high school where I studied,
Maybe I'll get a haircut ...
-----------
That everything will happen, that everything will happen,
That we get married once a month and not by chance,
I'll give you a ring and shout to everyone:
"Hey, I still have love
Love Love Love Love Love Love "
Once a month.
-----------
Then the clouds dispersed and the autumn passed again
Anyone who died then died of loneliness, racism,
From battlefields,
In the streets they sold the sun, I continued my life
I smiled because God there for a second smiled at me.
In autumn ...
-----------
It is almost eternal, almost temporary
We've almost started our whole life again.
And in the sunset you turned your head
Towards a nearby ship.
We nearly drowned in thirty seconds,
In the end we saved love.
-----------
Let's not get up, I'll take some time with you,
Another verse from the prayer,
"Give power as in the beginning,"
Another king download,
Inject you into vein,
One more and enough.
-----------
"The greatest thing in my life,
I want to love you all my life,
In a small, medium-sized house
The main thing is the interior. "
Let's go ahead,
We will understand our lives today and tomorrow ...
-----------
Suddenly you will feel the hand of time on your eyelids groping
And puts heavy years on me like your tired shoulder.
You will continue to wander through the paths, far from the mercy of your youth,
But close to them wander into the early years -
To your hill, to the beautiful, blessed, man, mother behind you
There will still be such a hill full of flowers and memories.
-----------
It was important for us to run through the streets,
Not to fake laughs, not to seek trouble,
I'm still excited when everyone talks to me about you.
Do not fall into the narrow eye, do not give up when the sky falls,
Closing my eyes and thinking about you yet.
How do you feel when there is love? Sometimes exhausted by closeness ...
-----------
Where are there other people like that man?
Which was like the weeping willows.
And like an ancient fortress was at the end of the road.
Where are there other people like that man?
Which was like the weeping willows.
Where are there ... [more 5 times]
-----------
"Everything is simple, so why is God busy?"
You whispered to me then under the blue sky,
I'm standing waiting for you patiently,
Just come back to me still a child.
And sometimes when you look a bit lost to me
Reminds you how flowering blooms
-----------
When the sun went down, I went pretty
And I wrote Naomi such a thing:
Perhaps we may be kings and slaves,
Maybe it was Adele's voice,
And from all the voices that were in my hands,
Only the voice of God remains.
-----------
That the country has already lost its identity,
It's hard to correct the mistake.
I found you suddenly,
Cold emotions turned to heat.
With all my compassion,
We were back together again.
-----------
Next to the house that was my home, they paved a street,
They gave him a name, they always give names.
Here are also the,
Once you look like the sea, and sometimes you do not,
Once you're there, and once you're here.
I used to be a fighter ...
-----------
Do not go to sleep before I sleep
Do not turn off the light in front of me
Let us listen to him.
Another song goes on the old radio
I leave you and fly there
Just tell me I'll come back when I get back.
-----------
We'll talk from the heart ...
It has been a strange week for Rabbi Nachman at the head,
Perhaps these are the beautiful years and there are no other,
Let's start at midnight, we'll see how it ends
We will not postpone tomorrow, what is not said, and we will begin to talk.
We'll talk from the heart ...
-----------
And slowly fell asleep in the car, because sometimes it is also a bed,
And dreaming of a cup of coffee with you, what are you dreaming about?
I'm going, I do not know,
Where, where, where,
You were everything to me,
And it was not long ago.
-----------
What can I do, I do not know anymore,
Maybe there's some secret,
Which few know.
Oh ... like an idiot,
I always run after her,
And says to her: "Come, and be with me."
-----------
Better dance half a minute
Better than lose her
To this day it is quite strange ...
Now among the few cypresses,
It's me who dances ...
Enough alone.
-----------
Like the colors of the rainbow, another cloud is tied to the thread
And he was told that the good days were coming
you and me...
you and me...
You and me, you and me, yes
You and me, you and me, you and me, yes
-----------
On the table are Chekhov's stories, like a stone that does not exist
Because I am a man in disguise
The soldier, bound in a straitjacket -
So crying for me gave birth to the moments of solitude,
The expectations and the years, and the crying
Two loving and distant hearts.
-----------
Say you mean.
Your silence is thundering.
What a sad day.
Tell me what are you ignoring?
Tell lies or truth.
Say something.
-----------
We waited nine in a child with sadness
Most of the time my wife
And I'm surrounded by you
Most of the time you are with me
My home
My wife is actually here
-----------
According to what I am ....
According to the words of the sages, the Messiah will soon come,
By summer time, the nights were very hot
Depending on the amount of AA, there will be a meeting soon
According to the amount of kisses, we will not part forever.
According to what I ...
-----------
Now my child with me is going.
Looking through the glass,
We have a country - why another one?
Outside the sunset of Monday,
Inside me and him like a man.
I have a wife, this is your mother ...
-----------
She's crying, too.
As beaches Putting leaves ...
All the separations are sad,
The pain of words cuts,
I called for a year and did not answer,
I'm going away from you.
-----------
You still love me, forever
A hundred thousand people were killed for what?
Maybe that, too, should be stopped
What do we want? Tell me what
I do not know what I want anymore
So quietly sit beside him ...
-----------
For her you can be,
Whatever you want,
For example, the king of the animals or the king of the mountains, if you climb somewhere,
Get up whatever you want
Because for her you always
King of the world, king of the world.
-----------
In the ditch, a whole company was caught by SS fire in the Tampo.
What I remember from that I write,
Grabbing a Haifa taxi, jumping to a disco.
Whores on the fence in my body only a burning demon,
Going dancing with dead soldiers in the heart.
Write down, write down, make an impression.
-----------
We like songs that are being run at a pace,
We saw people crying sadly,
We've spoken thousands of words in a row,
So what did we really want to say?
That it's been a long time since we've been here,
Notice how something here has changed.
-----------
Night and day, this way and that
Fourteen days without being together
Wet your face, close your eyes
Letting my imagination flow with the water
Fourteen days
They are an eternity lasting two weeks
-----------
Night and day, this way and that
Fourteen days without being together
Wet your face, close your eyes
Letting my imagination flow with the water
Fourteen days
They are an eternity lasting two weeks
-----------
She does not know what I'm going through.
While there is no love without end,
But this ending seems cursed to me,
Walking among the people on the street,
Shouting or or or or or or,
tell her.
-----------
We stick to music, music, music, music ...
And the band ...
Then I walk into the room and ask, "Is it?
Everyone here is fine, are they still alive? "
And you're still singing with a guitar, longing for the sea
Because the demand for love never ends
-----------
When I arrived I came
I stood at the door what I knew I did not know,
I undressed and moved like a madman in a room,
We've been together for a week like heaven
It's so dangerous to us.
Because I was created for you.
-----------
From here to here,
Like ballet music.
By the time the sea was over,
No, we will not know,
Rising costs cost us,
How much does it cost us.
-----------
Soon the sigh would break out-
Accept it as a very personal prayer.
He gave the rain only in his time,
And in the spring he spread flowers to us,
And let us see it again-
More than that we do not need.
-----------
And I was dreaming and awake.
Slowly the light went out alone,
And I was left dark, and I was alone,
From the white wall the pictures,
Sad sad, because suddenly when you did not come.
Suddenly when you did not come ...
-----------
Is it worth telling him
That I'm alone?
And once it's all simpler,
Even the word,
I'll tell you something that does not seem important,
But sounds wonderful.
-----------
There is no wisdom as a failure
The road is sure to win
Get up and wake up on your life
It's just for you
Bring the joy
Get up and watch what's happening around you. You owe it to yourself
-----------
Then we'll sing and then we'll be silent
We'll learn more about ourselves
Let's go down to the sea
We'll hear the waves
Then built in the hot sand
Palaces and towers
-----------
Every tear that washed from my eyes was left behind
You swear in my life I do not care if you do not come back
You will not come back
Every smile that had been quietly hidden was no longer waiting inside
I do not regret all those years
All the years
-----------
That Ali would not give up
And how much I wanted him to come today
I wanted you to come today like the wind
I've already opened a window
I wanted you to come today
Even without saying goodbye you will be sure it feels right to me
-----------
And at night it was cold and the heart remembered again
How did you talk for hours without words?
You have nothing left but the sadness remains
Lost between walls that you remember
Among all the silences that you have left you are left without words
without words
-----------
Look at tomorrow
The sun will tell me
It's not too late
Deep in the heart of both of us
We kept a promise
Go all the way with you
-----------
Never mind Tel Aviv periphery
Here we are all at the right pace
In secret I say we both feel together triumph
Sees what it does to him and how slowly the armor peels
In secret I say we both feel together triumph
See what it does to him Let's sing another last song
-----------
And we could not
leave
One fate
Put us here
Put us here
In this country
-----------
If there is a situation
Which will fall on me from heaven
Someone else who would like him better not to give up
Just as I had to give up
When the heart is burning how much is missing
From the day you got up and left
-----------
You know alone
I'm learning to walk
I've almost forgotten me to this day
It was enough for me
I want a little different
The heart shouts to me to start dreaming
-----------
Tell him I have a life
Lie to him, promise me, do not give him up
Maybe it would hurt him a little
Tell him how happy I am
How strong does not break
He trusted me still
-----------
A little unfamiliar feeling
Logic and madness
Between our walls
The voices echo
It's cold and it's okay
The fears also disappeared
-----------
The thoughts do not stop
Turns over, can not sleep
On the bed every night
A pair of tired eyes
Asking you again to see
God, let me just see
-----------
Show him the way
Call you O God
I swear to you in my life
Show me this way
My prayer to you King
I will serve you forever
-----------
How everyone dresses
Play it in matters
There were days, an open door, sleepless nights
When a song was burning in my soul
How everyone is thrown away
Play it dormant, there were days.
-----------
"Come on Sunday, Saturday and Passover
And do not forget a gift. "
I love you so much
And that's why I'm with you
So how do I feel I got married
With your mother?
-----------
Ever since you've walked everything here in silence
A simple boring world
How, how the nights seemed different to me
Everyone is bathed in light
I dared, I loved you
I dared, I flew you
-----------
Against the risks and forbidden taste
The heart is broken
I would change if I only knew how
All I had left was the strength to keep smiling
Maybe it was all a hooked game
The heart dominated his head and wrote the story
-----------
Now I'm all yours
You will not see me crying
Just before the flight, the heart is still afraid
Recalls a few nights when he was alone
Please fasten belts we take off
After I fell into the pits, there is no fear of heights
-----------
Except you do not care who listens
The happiness, wants to reply again
I built a world with a set
I smiled strangely
I opened the door for you
In my heart was a place for your heart
-----------
She knows what I usually think
When will you understand it is not appropriate
I'm angry
Angry
We want to live, we hope,
I deserve nothing less
-----------
In the second round of our lives
Luck will still haunt us
It's so real
For you and me
Thank God for everything
That alcohol had become his talk
-----------
You're doing me good
My mother tells me
That this guy is a bit like Dad
No smoker does not complain
Where else would I find another guy like that?
He is not like anyone. Romantic and sensitive ......
-----------
Because you're here and that's all I wanted
Let's just love everything forgotten because it's so hard for me
Then one look at my one look
She changed my world and loved my life
You felt me, with that look of mine
I forgot myself.
-----------
Maybe now you're hurting me You'll understand me Feel me hurt
In the days you love my life and at night I love you
How did you not think? When I cried, I did not know how many diaries I had burned
How I put my hopes in words
Please embrace me with your embrace, you are not alive, and the spirit of a paradise
Please embrace me with your embrace, my soul and my spirit
-----------
The sun shone above us / to the sounds of life
On an annual wandering night / And again try not to fall asleep / Suddenly the streets revolves / waiting for you
Do not go back Come to us / Always separate We returned / Do not go / Please do not go
I gave my life and my eyes to you / I did not believe that I fell / Do not go / Please do not go
Do not go back Come to us / Always separate We returned / Do not go / Please do not go
I gave my life and eyes to you. I did not believe that I fell / do not go / do not go
-----------
This is the world he knows
What is really love I also have no answer
You know all my world
You are far from my soul without knowing
At any distance that would be my treasure
I will always be loved by my heart
-----------
North in the depths of his soul
On a bench he waited over two hours
For a bus that would never come
And for a moment it seemed almost
Which we know
Another day and another story ..
-----------
And there is no more problem
If we close our eyes
Lie down in a sea of ​​peace
And when we woke ourselves up
The train passed
And there's no problem ...
-----------
In the opposite corner passes,
She knows I'm coming to see her and not another
She says something simple
If together then only separately
Just sit on a cup of coffee,
This nation is always above all expectations
-----------
And when we do, I'll say
This is the journey of my life
Nothing will separate us forever
Even if the world stops in one day
Local will always be by your side
All along I'm your lover
-----------
In a child world
There is no room for just dreaming.
Oh Don Quixote
Wake up for me,
Either way you stay
My knight.
-----------
Get out of the race
And find me a little hut
Isolated on a hill
Look at the year
Understanding and not moving.
And only to hear quiet ...
-----------
Vai Bei Eli
Behold me
Behold me
But you're good to me
They threw an orange at me
The chair is too low

His flute will desecrate
A sad song for Delia.
He is a shepherd and she is a shepherd,
How beautiful and tender.
The fields will bear her image
Night Day and Dalia.
-----------
I'm sleepy and a little jennony
But with a non-fuzzy finger,
I take you in my eyes,
What's your davin?
What is the davin, what is the davin,
What's your davin?

A wedding costs dearly
It's the price of love.
A multi-waiter with lunch
"Hurry up," he grumbles
"It's already five minutes to two
There's another couple that's getting married. "
-----------
Going to the unknown
To the unknown
To the unknown
Going into the know-how
Whether it's good or bad
Name unknown
-----------
Within a minute and a third
There was nobody left
They left nobly.
And if I ask
So it's pretty lucky
They are not my aunt and uncle.
-----------
Again we slide
Riding on the waves
Here comes another big wave
Caution, just do not fall
From Bat Yam to Herzliya
It's just me and my surfboard.
-----------
I hoped he would correct me
Because with all the renovations I've ever been through
I repressed forgot
A few screws fell as a child
And today I am ready to save the world
Only someone will take care of me
-----------
You have a color similar to the sky,
It turns out that I:
thinking of you
Every minute, with all your heart.
thinking of you
Every minute, with all your heart.

Apparently the stars had decided that
A rainy, distant day, she meets the fisherman
He whispers to her the secret of the waves
He catches fish
He catches fish
It's Pisces
-----------
This is not what I ordered ...
I had hopes,
Many expectations from the world.
I thought in my youth,
Everything would be perfect.
This is not what I ordered ...
-----------
"You're old, but you'll get over it"
And then I thought
Maybe I got carried away
So I followed
I've already gone mad
Coming home
-----------
It does not matter what your name is, Bronia,
Only important sequel, Sonia,
Just keep going in the street
Because if you stop, cancel Dizengoff.
And all that just tells you thank you
You gave me another reason to live.

Across the river
Lilies here and there floating,
A cruel spirit
Blowing through the streets.
Ola Lala
Waiting for her to come.

Take a look ahead
Sometimes a person is allowed to choose
And you are alone
Rolling in your way
you are not alone
Others alone with you
-----------
You'll find there are some signs
Which are sometimes a bit misleading
From here the road is surprising
Sometimes better for evil
I too walked in it
And it's your turn

The winds are getting colder
He gets up in the morning, corrected and refreshed
And pinched each time anew.

And she stands in a circle and looks around me.
I do not seem to feel soft just doing myself,
No no no no no no can not find my place.
Nahlieli, Nahlieli, I have a stream for me
And I have neither me nor her
And not Nahlieli.

You licked the honey
Which is not always correct
The milk spilled
You did not cry after him
With all the difficulties, the language, the walls
You stuck a peg and gave it to me

It's already half the night
The butcher did not run out
Even though the guests are already going
The music is over
In the end it just stays
Alone with flower arrangement

Love is in you
You do not have a day, you do not have a night
You have the medicine and you have the answer
It's all on your shoulder and you're not enough

When I'm without air I wrap myself in my pain
The tear crashes on the cheek
With tears all the sorrow and weeping
Jealousy still burns inside me
Tormenting my strength
It's me who breaks my heart
-----------
If I do not find you I will not rest until the wind takes me
I'm not going to get crazy, that's a sign of love
And this is the song I did not dare sing about myself and you
To your eyes, save the missing place, I dream of you
And this is a dream I did not dare to dream about myself and myself
In my trembling voice only to you wanderer, I dream of dreaming about you
-----------
We are not angels
You look at it upside down and say you can manage
And again squeezing another smile is less often than that much more
How long will we call it a future for a while until now it always becomes
It just looks far away. I tell you look at us
We are not angels and it is not paradise ...
-----------
I had better before you came
So I asked
Why me why you
Why do you have why me?
Why me why you
Why do you have why me?

And Mom does not come back it hurts and it's familiar
When the sweetness passes, there is a bitter taste
The children at the station take another ride to get away
From the embarrassing simplicity they still dream of breaking away
I spread my hands with the past to embrace
I 'm back now
-----------
My love is stormy but I am here by your side
My voice breaks the silence and caresses your silence
Like part of my body, you are always with me, forever
My love I have devoted myself for you
As roots in the ground by holding your hand
Like part of my body, you are always with me, forever

Woe to him no one knew her
His way of life is.
It is good for him to extinguish his fire,
And a pit fell down:
They are similar to this blind man,
For whom light was burning.

Wrapped in a bridal gown
Pure as an angel
Heavenly sent
Give me an answer
Bring love for you ...

And again I will sing my poems
